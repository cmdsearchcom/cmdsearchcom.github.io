<p>PERLFUNC(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFUNC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlfunc - Perl builtin functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The functions in this section can serve as terms in an
expression. They fall into two major categories: list
operators and named unary operators. These differ in their
<br>
precedence relationship with a following comma. (See the
precedence table in perlop.) List operators take more than
one argument, while unary operators can never take more than
<br>
one argument. Thus, a comma terminates the argument of a
unary operator, but merely separates the arguments of a list
operator. A unary operator generally provides scalar <br>
context to its argument, while a list operator may provide
either scalar or list contexts for its arguments. If it does
both, scalar arguments come first and list argument <br>
follow, and there can only ever be one such list argument.
For instance, splice() has three scalar arguments followed
by a list, whereas gethostbyname() has four scalar <br>
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the syntax descriptions that
follow, list operators that expect a list (and provide list
context for elements of the list) are shown with LIST as an
argument. Such a list may <br>
consist of any combination of scalar arguments or list
values; the list values will be included in the list as if
each individual element were interpolated at that point in
the <br>
list, forming a longer single-dimensional list value. Commas
should separate literal elements of the LIST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any function in the list below
may be used either with or without parentheses around its
arguments. (The syntax descriptions omit the parentheses.)
If you use parentheses, the <br>
simple but occasionally surprising rule is this: It looks
like a function, therefore it is a function, and precedence
doesn&rsquo;t matter. Otherwise it&rsquo;s a list operator
or unary <br>
operator, and precedence does matter. Whitespace between the
function and left parenthesis doesn&rsquo;t count, so
sometimes you need to be careful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print 1+2+4; # Prints 7. <br>
print(1+2) + 4; # Prints 3. <br>
print (1+2)+4; # Also prints 3! <br>
print +(1+2)+4; # Prints 7. <br>
print ((1+2)+4); # Prints 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run Perl with the -w
switch it can warn you about this. For example, the third
line above produces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print (...) interpreted as
function at - line 1. <br>
Useless use of integer addition in void context at - line
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few functions take no
arguments at all, and therefore work as neither unary nor
list operators. These include such functions as
&quot;time&quot; and &quot;endpwent&quot;. For example, <br>
&quot;time+86_400&quot; always means &quot;time() +
86_400&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For functions that can be used
in either a scalar or list context, nonabortive failure is
generally indicated in scalar context by returning the
undefined value, and in list <br>
context by returning the empty list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember the following important
rule: There is no rule that relates the behavior of an
expression in list context to its behavior in scalar
context, or vice versa. It might do <br>
two totally different things. Each operator and function
decides which sort of value would be most appropriate to
return in scalar context. Some operators return the length
of <br>
the list that would have been returned in list context. Some
operators return the first value in the list. Some operators
return the last value in the list. Some operators <br>
return a count of successful operations. In general, they do
what you want, unless you want consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A named array in scalar context
is quite different from what would at first glance appear to
be a list in scalar context. You can&rsquo;t get a list like
&quot;(1,2,3)&quot; into being in <br>
scalar context, because the compiler knows the context at
compile time. It would generate the scalar comma operator
there, not the list construction version of the comma. That
<br>
means it was never a list to start with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, functions in Perl
that serve as wrappers for system calls
(&quot;syscalls&quot;) of the same name (like chown(2),
fork(2), closedir(2), etc.) return true when they succeed
and <br>
&quot;undef&quot; otherwise, as is usually mentioned in the
descriptions below. This is different from the C interfaces,
which return &quot;-1&quot; on failure. Exceptions to this
rule include <br>
&quot;wait&quot;, &quot;waitpid&quot;, and
&quot;syscall&quot;. System calls also set the special $!
variable on failure. Other functions do not, except
accidentally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension modules can also hook
into the Perl parser to define new kinds of keyword-headed
expression. These may look like functions, but may also look
completely different. <br>
The syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the
extension. If you are an implementor, see
&quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism.
If you are using such a <br>
module, see the module&rsquo;s documentation for details of
the syntax that it defines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Functions by Category <br>
Here are Perl&rsquo;s functions (including things that look
like functions, like some keywords and named operators)
arranged by category. Some functions appear in more than one
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability <br>
Perl was born in Unix and can therefore access all common
Unix system calls. In non-Unix environments, the
functionality of some Unix system calls may not be available
or <br>
details of the available functionality may differ slightly.
The Perl functions affected by this are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-X&quot;,

available platform-specific documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alphabetical Listing of Perl
Functions <br>
-X FILEHANDLE <br>
-X EXPR <br>
-X DIRHANDLE <br>
-X A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.
This unary operator takes one argument, either a filename, a
filehandle, or a dirhandle, and tests the associated <br>
file to see if something is true about it. If the argument
is omitted, tests $_, except for &quot;-t&quot;, which tests
STDIN. Unless otherwise documented, it returns 1 for true
and <br>
&rsquo;&rsquo; for false, or the undefined value if the file
doesn&rsquo;t exist. Despite the funny names, precedence is
the same as any other named unary operator. The operator may
be any <br>
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r File is readable by effective
uid/gid. <br>
-w File is writable by effective uid/gid. <br>
-x File is executable by effective uid/gid. <br>
-o File is owned by effective uid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R File is readable by real
uid/gid. <br>
-W File is writable by real uid/gid. <br>
-X File is executable by real uid/gid. <br>
-O File is owned by real uid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e File exists. <br>
-z File has zero size (is empty). <br>
-s File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f File is a plain file. <br>
-d File is a directory. <br>
-l File is a symbolic link. <br>
-p File is a named pipe (FIFO), or Filehandle is a pipe.
<br>
-S File is a socket. <br>
-b File is a block special file. <br>
-c File is a character special file. <br>
-t Filehandle is opened to a tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u File has setuid bit set. <br>
-g File has setgid bit set. <br>
-k File has sticky bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T File is an ASCII text file
(heuristic guess). <br>
-B File is a &quot;binary&quot; file (opposite of -T).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Script start time minus file
modification time, in days. <br>
-A Same for access time. <br>
-C Same for inode change time (Unix, may differ for other
platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
chomp; <br>
next unless -f $_; # ignore specials <br>
#... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;-s/a/b/&quot;
does not do a negated substitution. Saying
&quot;-exp($foo)&quot; still works as expected, however:
only single letters following a minus are interpreted as
file <br>
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These operators are exempt from
the &quot;looks like a function rule&quot; described above.
That is, an opening parenthesis after the operator does not
affect how much of the <br>
following code constitutes the argument. Put the opening
parentheses before the operator to separate it from code
that follows (this applies only to operators with higher
<br>
precedence than unary operators, of course):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s($file) + 1024 # probably
wrong; same as -s($file + 1024) <br>
(-s $file) + 1024 # correct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpretation of the file
permission operators &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-R&quot;,
&quot;-w&quot;, &quot;-W&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, and
&quot;-X&quot; is by default based solely on the mode of the
file and the uids and gids of the <br>
user. There may be other reasons you can&rsquo;t actually
read, write, or execute the file: for example network
filesystem access controls, ACLs (access control lists),
read-only <br>
filesystems, and unrecognized executable formats. Note that
the use of these six specific operators to verify if some
operation is possible is usually a mistake, because it <br>
may be open to race conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that, for the
superuser on the local filesystems, the &quot;-r&quot;,
&quot;-R&quot;, &quot;-w&quot;, and &quot;-W&quot; tests
always return 1, and &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-X&quot;
return 1 if any execute bit is set in the <br>
mode. Scripts run by the superuser may thus need to do a
stat() to determine the actual mode of the file, or
temporarily set their effective uid to something else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using ACLs, there is
a pragma called &quot;filetest&quot; that may produce more
accurate results than the bare stat() mode bits. When under
&quot;use filetest &rsquo;access&rsquo;&quot; the <br>
above-mentioned filetests test whether the permission
can(not) be granted using the access(2) family of system
calls. Also note that the &quot;-x&quot; and &quot;-X&quot;
may under this pragma <br>
return true even if there are no execute permission bits set
(nor any extra execute permission ACLs). This strangeness is
due to the underlying system calls&rsquo; definitions. <br>
Note also that, due to the implementation of &quot;use
filetest &rsquo;access&rsquo;&quot;, the &quot;_&quot;
special filehandle won&rsquo;t cache the results of the file
tests when this pragma is in effect. <br>
Read the documentation for the &quot;filetest&quot; pragma
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-T&quot; and
&quot;-B&quot; switches work as follows. The first block or
so of the file is examined for odd characters such as
strange control codes or characters with the high bit <br>
set. If too many strange characters (&gt;30%) are found,
it&rsquo;s a &quot;-B&quot; file; otherwise it&rsquo;s a
&quot;-T&quot; file. Also, any file containing a zero byte
in the first block is considered a <br>
binary file. If &quot;-T&quot; or &quot;-B&quot; is used on
a filehandle, the current IO buffer is examined rather than
the first block. Both &quot;-T&quot; and &quot;-B&quot;
return true on an empty file, or a <br>
file at EOF when testing a filehandle. Because you have to
read a file to do the &quot;-T&quot; test, on most occasions
you want to use a &quot;-f&quot; against the file first, as
in &quot;next <br>
unless -f $file &amp;&amp; -T $file&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the file tests (or
either the &quot;stat&quot; or &quot;lstat&quot; operator)
is given the special filehandle consisting of a solitary
underline, then the stat structure of the <br>
previous file test (or stat operator) is used, saving a
system call. (This doesn&rsquo;t work with &quot;-t&quot;,
and you need to remember that lstat() and &quot;-l&quot;
leave values in the stat <br>
structure for the symbolic link, not the real file.) (Also,
if the stat buffer was filled by an &quot;lstat&quot; call,
&quot;-T&quot; and &quot;-B&quot; will reset it with the
results of &quot;stat _&quot;). <br>
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Can do.0 if -r $a ||
-w _ || -x _;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat($filename); <br>
print &quot;Readable0 if -r _; <br>
print &quot;Writable0 if -w _; <br>
print &quot;Executable0 if -x _; <br>
print &quot;Setuid0 if -u _; <br>
print &quot;Setgid0 if -g _; <br>
print &quot;Sticky0 if -k _; <br>
print &quot;Text0 if -T _; <br>
print &quot;Binary0 if -B _;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of Perl 5.9.1, as a form of
purely syntactic sugar, you can stack file test operators,
in a way that &quot;-f -w -x $file&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;-x $file &amp;&amp; -w _ &amp;&amp; -f _&quot;. (This
<br>
is only fancy fancy: if you use the return value of &quot;-f
$file&quot; as an argument to another filetest operator, no
special magic will happen.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alarm SECONDS <br>
alarm <br>
Arranges to have a SIGALRM delivered to this process after
the specified number of wallclock seconds has elapsed. If
SECONDS is not specified, the value stored in $_ is <br>
used. (On some machines, unfortunately, the elapsed time may
be up to one second less or more than you specified because
of how seconds are counted, and process scheduling <br>
may delay the delivery of the signal even further.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one timer may be counting
at once. Each call disables the previous timer, and an
argument of 0 may be supplied to cancel the previous timer
without starting a new one. <br>
The returned value is the amount of time remaining on the
previous timer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For delays of finer granularity
than one second, the Time::HiRes module (from CPAN, and
starting from Perl 5.8 part of the standard distribution)
provides ualarm(). You may <br>
also use Perl&rsquo;s four-argument version of select()
leaving the first three arguments undefined, or you might be
able to use the &quot;syscall&quot; interface to access
setitimer(2) if <br>
your system supports it. See perlfaq8 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is usually a mistake to
intermix &quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;sleep&quot; calls,
because &quot;sleep&quot; may be internally implemented on

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use

an &quot;eval&quot;/&quot;die&quot; pair. You can&rsquo;t
rely on the alarm causing the system call to fail with $!
set to &quot;EINTR&quot; <br>
because Perl sets up signal handlers to restart system calls
on some systems. Using &quot;eval&quot;/&quot;die&quot;
always works, modulo the caveats given in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binmode FILEHANDLE, LAYER <br>
binmode FILEHANDLE <br>
Arranges for FILEHANDLE to be read or written in
&quot;binary&quot; or &quot;text&quot; mode on systems where
the run-time libraries distinguish between binary and text
files. If FILEHANDLE is <br>
an expression, the value is taken as the name of the
filehandle. Returns true on success, otherwise it returns
&quot;undef&quot; and sets $! (errno).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems (in general,
DOS- and Windows-based systems) binmode() is necessary when
you&rsquo;re not working with a text file. For the sake of
portability it is a good idea <br>
always to use it when appropriate, and never to use it when
it isn&rsquo;t appropriate. Also, people can set their I/O
to be by default UTF8-encoded Unicode, not bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words: regardless of
platform, use binmode() on binary data, like images, for
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LAYER is present it is a
single string, but may contain multiple directives. The
directives alter the behaviour of the filehandle. When LAYER
is present, using binmode <br>
on a text file makes sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LAYER is omitted or specified
as &quot;:raw&quot; the filehandle is made suitable for
passing binary data. This includes turning off possible CRLF
translation and marking it as <br>
bytes (as opposed to Unicode characters). Note that, despite
what may be implied in &quot;Programming Perl&quot; (the
Camel, 3rd edition) or elsewhere, &quot;:raw&quot; is not
simply the <br>
inverse of &quot;:crlf&quot;. Other layers that would affect
the binary nature of the stream are also disabled. See
PerlIO, perlrun, and the discussion about the PERLIO
environment <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;:bytes&quot;,
&quot;:crlf&quot;, &quot;:utf8&quot;, and any other
directives of the form &quot;:...&quot;, are called I/O
layers. The &quot;open&quot; pragma can be used to establish
default I/O layers. See open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LAYER parameter of the
binmode() function is described as &quot;DISCIPLINE&quot; in
&quot;Programming Perl, 3rd Edition&quot;. However, since
the publishing of this book, by many known as <br>
&quot;Camel III&quot;, the consensus of the naming of this
functionality has moved from &quot;discipline&quot; to
&quot;layer&quot;. All documentation of this version of Perl
therefore refers to &quot;layers&quot; <br>
rather than to &quot;disciplines&quot;. Now back to the
regularly scheduled documentation...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To mark FILEHANDLE as UTF-8, use
&quot;:utf8&quot; or &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;.
&quot;:utf8&quot; just marks the data as UTF-8 without
further checking, while &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot; checks
the data for <br>
actually being valid UTF-8. More details can be found in
PerlIO::encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, binmode() should be
called after open() but before any I/O is done on the
filehandle. Calling binmode() normally flushes any pending
buffered output data (and <br>
perhaps pending input data) on the handle. An exception to
this is the &quot;:encoding&quot; layer that changes the
default character encoding of the handle; see
&quot;open&quot;. The <br>
&quot;:encoding&quot; layer sometimes needs to be called in
mid-stream, and it doesn&rsquo;t flush the stream. The
&quot;:encoding&quot; also implicitly pushes on top of
itself the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer <br>
because internally Perl operates on UTF8-encoded Unicode
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operating system, device
drivers, C libraries, and Perl run-time system all conspire
to let the programmer treat a single character (&quot;0) as
the line terminator, <br>
irrespective of external representation. On many operating
systems, the native text file representation matches the
internal representation, but on some platforms the <br>
external representation of &quot;0 is made up of more than
one character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All variants of Unix, Mac OS
(old and new), and Stream_LF files on VMS use a single
character to end each line in the external representation of
text (even though that single <br>
character is CARRIAGE RETURN on old, pre-Darwin flavors of
Mac OS, and is LINE FEED on Unix and most VMS files). In
other systems like OS/2, DOS, and the various flavors of
<br>
MS-Windows, your program sees a &quot;0 as a simple &quot;
systems, &quot; text files, but it can be disastrous for
binary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another consequence of using
binmode() (on some systems) is that special end-of-file
markers will be seen as part of the data stream. For systems
from the Microsoft family <br>
this means that, if your binary data contain &quot; <br>
binmode() is important not only for readline() and print()
operations, but also when using read(), seek(), sysread(),
syswrite() and tell() (see perlport for more details). <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bless REF,CLASSNAME <br>
bless REF <br>
This function tells the thingy referenced by REF that it is
now an object in the CLASSNAME package. If CLASSNAME is
omitted, the current package is used. Because a
&quot;bless&quot; <br>
is often the last thing in a constructor, it returns the
reference for convenience. Always use the two-argument

the blessing. Seeperlobj for more about the blessing (and
blessings) of objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider always blessing objects
in CLASSNAMEs that are mixed case. Namespaces with all
lowercase names are considered reserved for Perl pragmata.
Builtin types have all <br>
uppercase names. To prevent confusion, you may wish to avoid
such package names as well. Make sure that CLASSNAME is a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caller EXPR <br>
caller <br>
Returns the context of the current subroutine call. In
scalar context, returns the caller&rsquo;s package name if
there is a caller (that is, if we&rsquo;re in a subroutine
or &quot;eval&quot; or <br>
&quot;require&quot;) and the undefined value otherwise. In
list context, returns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># 0 1 2 <br>
($package, $filename, $line) = caller;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With EXPR, it returns some extra
information that the debugger uses to print a stack trace.

$wantarray, $evaltext, $is_require, $hints, $bitmask,
$hinthash) <br>
= caller($i);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here $subroutine may be
&quot;(eval)&quot; if the frame is not a subroutine call,
but an &quot;eval&quot;. In such a case additional elements
$evaltext and $is_require are set: $is_require is <br>
true if the frame is created by a &quot;require&quot; or
&quot;use&quot; statement, $evaltext contains the text of
the &quot;eval EXPR&quot; statement. In particular, for an
&quot;eval BLOCK&quot; statement, <br>
$subroutine is &quot;(eval)&quot;, but $evaltext is
undefined. (Note also that each &quot;use&quot; statement
creates a &quot;require&quot; frame inside an &quot;eval
EXPR&quot; frame.) $subroutine may also be <br>
&quot;(unknown)&quot; if this particular subroutine happens
to have been deleted from the symbol table. $hasargs is true
if a new instance of @_ was set up for the frame. $hints and
<br>
$bitmask contain pragmatic hints that the caller was
compiled with. The $hints and $bitmask values are subject to
change between versions of Perl, and are not meant for <br>
external use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$hinthash is a reference to a
hash containing the value of &quot;%^H&quot; when the caller
was compiled, or &quot;undef&quot; if &quot;%^H&quot; was
empty. Do not modify the values of this hash, as they <br>
are the actual values stored in the optree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, when called from
within the DB package in list context, and with an argument,
caller returns more detailed information: it sets the list
variable @DB::args to be <br>
the arguments with which the subroutine was invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that the optimizer
might have optimized call frames away before
&quot;caller&quot; had a chance to get the information. That
means that caller(N) might not return information <br>
about the call frame you expect it to, for &quot;N &gt;
1&quot;. In particular, @DB::args might have information
from the previous time &quot;caller&quot; was called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that setting @DB::args
is best effort, intended for debugging or generating
backtraces, and should not be relied upon. In particular, as
@_ contains aliases to the <br>
caller&rsquo;s arguments, Perl does not take a copy of @_,
so @DB::args will contain modifications the subroutine makes
to @_ or its contents, not the original values at call time.
<br>
@DB::args, like @_, does not hold explicit references to its
elements, so under certain cases its elements may have
become freed and reallocated for other variables or <br>
temporary values. Finally, a side effect of the current
implementation is that the effects of &quot;shift @_&quot;
can normally be undone (but not &quot;pop @_&quot; or other
splicing, and not <br>
if a reference to @_ has been taken, and subject to the
caveat about reallocated elements), so @DB::args is actually
a hybrid of the current state and initial state of @_. <br>
Buyer beware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir EXPR <br>
chdir FILEHANDLE <br>
chdir DIRHANDLE <br>
chdir <br>
Changes the working directory to EXPR, if possible. If EXPR
is omitted, changes to the directory specified by
$ENV{HOME}, if set; if not, changes to the directory
specified <br>
by $ENV{LOGDIR}. (Under VMS, the variable $ENV{SYS$LOGIN} is
also checked, and used if it is set.) If neither is set,
&quot;chdir&quot; does nothing. It returns true on success,
<br>
false otherwise. See the example under &quot;die&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod LIST <br>
Changes the permissions of a list of files. The first
element of the list must be the numeric mode, which should
probably be an octal number, and which definitely should not

be a string of octal digits: 0644 is okay, but

chomp <br>
This safer version of &quot;chop&quot; removes any trailing
string that corresponds to the current value of $/ (also
known as $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR in the &quot;English&quot;
module). It <br>
returns the total number of characters removed from all its
arguments. It&rsquo;s often used to remove the newline from
the end of an input record when you&rsquo;re worried that
the <br>
final record may be missing its newline. When in paragraph
mode (&quot;$/ = &quot;&quot;&quot;), it removes all
trailing newlines from the string. When in slurp mode
(&quot;$/ = undef&quot;) or fixed- <br>
length record mode ($/ is a reference to an integer or the
like; see perlvar) chomp() won&rsquo;t remove anything. If

&lsquo;pwd&lsquo;;&quot;, rather than as &quot;chomp( $cwd =

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chop VARIABLE <br>
chop( LIST ) <br>
chop <br>
Chops off the last character of a string and returns the
character chopped. It is much more efficient than

working directory, which is unaffected.) For security
reasons, this call is restricted to the superuser. If
FILENAME <br>
is omitted, does a &quot;chroot&quot; to $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close FILEHANDLE <br>
close <br>
Closes the file or pipe associated with the filehandle,
flushes the IO buffers, and closes the system file
descriptor. Returns true if those operations succeed and if
no <br>
error was reported by any PerlIO layer. Closes the currently
selected filehandle if the argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t have to close
FILEHANDLE if you are immediately going to do another
&quot;open&quot; on it, because &quot;open&quot; closes it
for you. (See open.) However, an explicit &quot;close&quot;
on an <br>
input file resets the line counter ($.), while the implicit
close done by &quot;open&quot; does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filehandle came from a
piped open, &quot;close&quot; returns false if one of the
other syscalls involved fails or if its program exits with
non-zero status. If the only problem <br>
was that the program exited non-zero, $! will be set to 0.
Closing a pipe also waits for the process executing on the
pipe to exit--in case you wish to look at the output <br>
of the pipe afterwards--and implicitly puts the exit status
value of that command into $? and
&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are multiple threads
running, &quot;close&quot; on a filehandle from a piped open
returns true without waiting for the child process to
terminate, if the filehandle is still <br>
open in another thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closing the read end of a pipe
before the process writing to it at the other end is done
writing results in the writer receiving a SIGPIPE. If the
other end can&rsquo;t handle <br>
that, be sure to read all the data before closing the
pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(OUTPUT, &rsquo;|sort
&gt;foo&rsquo;) # pipe to sort <br>
or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t start sort: $!&quot;; <br>
#... # print stuff to output <br>
close OUTPUT # wait for sort to finish <br>
or warn $! ? &quot;Error closing sort pipe: $!&quot; <br>
: &quot;Exit status $? from sort&quot;; <br>
open(INPUT, &rsquo;foo&rsquo;) # get sort&rsquo;s results
<br>
or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open &rsquo;foo&rsquo; for input:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILEHANDLE may be an expression
whose value can be used as an indirect filehandle, usually
the real filehandle name or an autovivified handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">closedir DIRHANDLE <br>
Closes a directory opened by &quot;opendir&quot; and returns
the success of that system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect SOCKET,NAME <br>
Attempts to connect to a remote socket, just like
connect(2). Returns true if it succeeded, false otherwise.
NAME should be a packed address of the appropriate type for
the <br>
socket. See the examples in &quot;Sockets: Client/Server
Communication&quot; in perlipc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue BLOCK <br>
continue <br>
When followed by a BLOCK, &quot;continue&quot; is actually a
flow control statement rather than a function. If there is a
&quot;continue&quot; BLOCK attached to a BLOCK (typically in
a &quot;while&quot; <br>
or &quot;foreach&quot;), it is always executed just before
the conditional is about to be evaluated again, just like
the third part of a &quot;for&quot; loop in C. Thus it can
be used to <br>
increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been
continued via the &quot;next&quot; statement (which is
similar to the C &quot;continue&quot; statement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;last&quot;,
&quot;next&quot;, or &quot;redo&quot; may appear within a
&quot;continue&quot; block; &quot;last&quot; and
&quot;redo&quot; behave as if they had been executed within
the main block. So will &quot;next&quot;, but since it <br>
will execute a &quot;continue&quot; block, it may be more
entertaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (EXPR) { <br>
### redo always comes here <br>
do_something; <br>
} continue { <br>
### next always comes here <br>
do_something_else; <br>
# then back the top to re-check EXPR <br>
} <br>
### last always comes here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omitting the
&quot;continue&quot; section is equivalent to using an empty
one, logically enough, so &quot;next&quot; goes directly
back to check the condition at the top of the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there is no BLOCK,
&quot;continue&quot; is a function that falls through the
current &quot;when&quot; or &quot;default&quot; block
instead of iterating a dynamically enclosing
&quot;foreach&quot; or exiting a <br>
lexically enclosing &quot;given&quot;. In Perl 5.14 and
earlier, this form of &quot;continue&quot; was only
available when the &quot;switch&quot; feature was enabled.
See feature and &quot;Switch Statements&quot; <br>
in perlsyn for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cos EXPR <br>
cos Returns the cosine of EXPR (expressed in radians). If
EXPR is omitted, takes the cosine of $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the inverse cosine
operation, you may use the &quot;Math::Trig::acos()&quot;
function, or use this relation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub acos { atan2( sqrt(1 - $_[0]
* $_[0]), $_[0] ) }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crypt PLAINTEXT,SALT <br>
Creates a digest string exactly like the crypt(3) function
in the C library (assuming that you actually have a version
there that has not been extirpated as a potential <br>
munition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crypt() is a one-way hash
function. The PLAINTEXT and SALT are turned into a short
string, called a digest, which is returned. The same
PLAINTEXT and SALT will always <br>
return the same string, but there is no (known) way to get
the original PLAINTEXT from the hash. Small changes in the
PLAINTEXT or SALT will result in large changes in the <br>
digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no decrypt function.
This function isn&rsquo;t all that useful for cryptography
(for that, look for Crypt modules on your nearby CPAN
mirror) and the name &quot;crypt&quot; is a <br>
bit of a misnomer. Instead it is primarily used to check if
two pieces of text are the same without having to transmit
or store the text itself. An example is checking if a <br>
correct password is given. The digest of the password is
stored, not the password itself. The user types in a
password that is crypt()&rsquo;d with the same salt as the
stored <br>
digest. If the two digests match, the password is
correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When verifying an existing
digest string you should use the digest as the salt (like
&quot;crypt($plain, $digest) eq $digest&quot;). The SALT
used to create the digest is visible as <br>
part of the digest. This ensures crypt() will hash the new
string with the same salt as the digest. This allows your
code to work with the standard crypt and with more <br>
exotic implementations. In other words, assume nothing about
the returned string itself nor about how many bytes of SALT
may matter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traditionally the result is a
string of 13 bytes: two first bytes of the salt, followed by
11 bytes from the set &quot;[./0-9A-Za-z]&quot;, and only
the first eight bytes of PLAINTEXT <br>
mattered. But alternative hashing schemes (like MD5), higher
level security schemes (like C2), and implementations on
non-Unix platforms may produce different strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When choosing a new salt create
a random two character string whose characters come from the
set &quot;[./0-9A-Za-z]&quot; (like &quot;join
&rsquo;&rsquo;, (&rsquo;.&rsquo;, &rsquo;/&rsquo;, 0..9,
&rsquo;A&rsquo;..&rsquo;Z&rsquo;,
&rsquo;a&rsquo;..&rsquo;z&rsquo;)[rand 64, <br>
rand 64]&quot;). This set of characters is just a
recommendation; the characters allowed in the salt depend
solely on your system&rsquo;s crypt library, and Perl
can&rsquo;t restrict what <br>
salts &quot;crypt()&quot; accepts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example that
makes sure that whoever runs this program knows their
password:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$pwd = (getpwuid($&lt;))[1];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system &quot;stty -echo&quot;;
<br>
print &quot;Password: &quot;; <br>
chomp($word = &lt;STDIN&gt;); <br>
print &quot;0; <br>
system &quot;stty echo&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (crypt($word, $pwd) ne $pwd)
{ <br>
die &quot;Sorry...0; <br>
} else { <br>
print &quot;ok0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, typing in your own
password to whoever asks you for it is unwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The crypt function is unsuitable
for hashing large quantities of data, not least of all
because you can&rsquo;t get the information back. Look at
the Digest module for more robust <br>
algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using crypt() on a Unicode
string (which potentially has characters with codepoints
above 255), Perl tries to make sense of the situation by
trying to downgrade (a copy <br>
of) the string back to an eight-bit byte string before
calling crypt() (on that copy). If that works, good. If not,
crypt() dies with &quot;Wide character in crypt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbmclose HASH <br>
[This function has been largely superseded by the
&quot;untie&quot; function.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Breaks the binding between a DBM
file and a hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;dbmclose&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbmopen HASH,DBNAME,MASK <br>
[This function has been largely superseded by the tie
function.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This binds a dbm(3), ndbm(3),
sdbm(3), gdbm(3), or Berkeley DB file to a hash. HASH is the
name of the hash. (Unlike normal &quot;open&quot;, the first
argument is not a filehandle, <br>
even though it looks like one). DBNAME is the name of the
database (without the .dir or .pag extension if any). If the
database does not exist, it is created with <br>
protection specified by MASK (as modified by the
&quot;umask&quot;). To prevent creation of the database if
it doesn&rsquo;t exist, you may specify a MODE of 0, and the
function will return <br>
a false value if it can&rsquo;t find an existing database.
If your system supports only the older DBM functions, you
may make only one &quot;dbmopen&quot; call in your program.
In older <br>
versions of Perl, if your system had neither DBM nor ndbm,
calling &quot;dbmopen&quot; produced a fatal error; it now
falls back to sdbm(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t have write
access to the DBM file, you can only read hash variables,
not set them. If you want to test whether you can write,
either use file tests or try <br>
setting a dummy hash entry inside an &quot;eval&quot; to
trap the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that functions such as
&quot;keys&quot; and &quot;values&quot; may return huge
lists when used on large DBM files. You may prefer to use
the &quot;each&quot; function to iterate over large DBM <br>
files. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># print out history file offsets
<br>
dbmopen(%HIST,&rsquo;/usr/lib/news/history&rsquo;,0666);
<br>
while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) { <br>
print $key, &rsquo; = &rsquo;, unpack(&rsquo;L&rsquo;,$val),
&quot;0; <br>
} <br>
dbmclose(%HIST);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also AnyDBM_File for a more
general description of the pros and cons of the various dbm
approaches, as well as DB_File for a particularly rich
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can control which DBM
library you use by loading that library before you call
dbmopen():</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use DB_File; <br>
dbmopen(%NS_Hist,
&quot;$ENV{HOME}/.netscape/history.db&quot;) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined EXPR <br>
defined <br>
Returns a Boolean value telling whether EXPR has a value
other than the undefined value &quot;undef&quot;. If EXPR is
not present, $_ is checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many operations return
&quot;undef&quot; to indicate failure, end of file, system
error, uninitialized variable, and other exceptional
conditions. This function allows you to <br>
distinguish &quot;undef&quot; from other values. (A simple
Boolean test will not distinguish among &quot;undef&quot;,
zero, the empty string, and &quot;0&quot;, which are all
equally false.) Note that <br>
since &quot;undef&quot; is a valid scalar, its presence
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily indicate an exceptional condition:
&quot;pop&quot; returns &quot;undef&quot; when its argument
is an empty array, or when the <br>
element to return happens to be &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use
&quot;defined(&amp;func)&quot; to check whether subroutine
&amp;func has ever been defined. The return value is
unaffected by any forward declarations of &amp;func. A
subroutine <br>
that is not defined may still be callable: its package may
have an &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; method that makes it spring
into existence the first time that it is called; see
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of &quot;defined&quot; on
aggregates (hashes and arrays) is deprecated. It used to
report whether memory for that aggregate had ever been
allocated. This behavior may disappear <br>
in future versions of Perl. You should instead use a simple
test for size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (@an_array) { print &quot;has
array elements0 } <br>
if (%a_hash) { print &quot;has hash members0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used on a hash element, it
tells you whether the value is defined, not whether the key
exists in the hash. Use &quot;exists&quot; for the latter
purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print if defined $switch{D};
<br>
print &quot;$val0 while defined($val = pop(@ary)); <br>
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t readlink $sym: $!&quot; <br>
unless defined($value = readlink $sym); <br>
sub foo { defined &amp;$bar ? &amp;$bar(@_) : die &quot;No
bar&quot;; } <br>
$debugging = 0 unless defined $debugging;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Many folks tend to overuse
&quot;defined&quot; and are then surprised to discover that
the number 0 and &quot;&quot; (the zero-length string) are,
in fact, defined values. For example, <br>
if you say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ab&quot; =~ /a(.*)b/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pattern match succeeds and
$1 is defined, although it matched &quot;nothing&quot;. It
didn&rsquo;t really fail to match anything. Rather, it
matched something that happened to be zero <br>
characters long. This is all very above-board and honest.
When a function returns an undefined value, it&rsquo;s an
admission that it couldn&rsquo;t give you an honest answer.
So you <br>
should use &quot;defined&quot; only when questioning the
integrity of what you&rsquo;re trying to do. At other times,
a simple comparison to 0 or &quot;&quot; is what you
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;undef&quot;,
&quot;exists&quot;, &quot;ref&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete EXPR <br>
Given an expression that specifies an element or slice of a
hash, &quot;delete&quot; deletes the specified elements from
that hash so that exists() on that element no longer returns
<br>
true. Setting a hash element to the undefined value does not
remove its key, but deleting it does; see
&quot;exists&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In list context, returns the
value or values deleted, or the last such element in scalar
context. The return list&rsquo;s length always matches that
of the argument list: deleting <br>
non-existent elements returns the undefined value in their
corresponding positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete() may also be used on
arrays and array slices, but its behavior is less
straightforward. Although exists() will return false for
deleted entries, deleting array <br>
elements never changes indices of existing values; use
shift() or splice() for that. However, if all deleted
elements fall at the end of an array, the array&rsquo;s size
shrinks <br>
to the position of the highest element that still tests true
for exists(), or to 0 if none do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Calling delete on array
values is deprecated and likely to be removed in a future
version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deleting from %ENV modifies the
environment. Deleting from a hash tied to a DBM file deletes
the entry from the DBM file. Deleting from a
&quot;tied&quot; hash or array may not <br>
necessarily return anything; it depends on the
implementation of the &quot;tied&quot; package&rsquo;s
DELETE method, which may do whatever it pleases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;delete local
EXPR&quot; construct localizes the deletion to the current
block at run time. Until the block exits, elements locally
deleted temporarily no longer exist. See <br>
&quot;Localized deletion of elements of composite

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%hash = (foo =&gt; 11, bar =&gt;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach $index (0 .. $#ARRAY) {

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete @ARRAY[0 .. $#ARRAY];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But both are slower than
assigning the empty list or undefining %HASH or @ARRAY,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%HASH = (); # completely empty
%HASH <br>
undef %HASH; # forget %HASH ever existed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ARRAY = (); # completely empty
@ARRAY <br>
undef @ARRAY; # forget @ARRAY ever existed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EXPR can be arbitrarily
complicated provided its final operation is an element or
slice of an aggregate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete $ref-&gt;[$x][$y]{$key};
<br>
delete @{$ref-&gt;[$x][$y]}{$key1, $key2, @morekeys};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete

delete @{$ref-&gt;[$x][$y]}[$index1, $index2,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">die LIST <br>
&quot;die&quot; raises an exception. Inside an
&quot;eval&quot; the error message is stuffed into $@ and
the &quot;eval&quot; is terminated with the undefined value.
If the exception is outside of all <br>
enclosing &quot;eval&quot;s, then the uncaught exception
prints LIST to &quot;STDERR&quot; and exits with a non-zero
value. If you need to exit the process with a specific exit
code, see <br>
&quot;exit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the last element of LIST does
not end in a newline, the current script line number and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: sometimes appending

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output is empty and $@
contains an object reference that has a
&quot;PROPAGATE&quot; method, that method will be called
with additional file and line number parameters. The <br>
return value replaces the value in $@; i.e., as if &quot;$@

called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $@ is empty then the string

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an uncaught exception results

exit $? &gt;&gt; 8 if $? &gt;&gt; 8; # child exit status
<br>
exit 255; # last resort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intent is to squeeze as much
possible information about the likely cause into the limited
space of the system exit code. However, as $! is the value
of C&rsquo;s &quot;errno&quot;, <br>
which can be set by any system call, this means that the
value of the exit code used by &quot;die&quot; can be
non-predictable, so should not be relied upon, other than to
be non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also call
&quot;die&quot; with a reference argument, and if this is
trapped within an &quot;eval&quot;, $@ contains that
reference. This permits more elaborate exception handling
using <br>
objects that maintain arbitrary state about the exception.
Such a scheme is sometimes preferable to matching particular
string values of $@ with regular expressions. <br>
Because $@ is a global variable and &quot;eval&quot; may be
used within object implementations, be careful that
analyzing the error object doesn&rsquo;t replace the
reference in the global <br>
variable. It&rsquo;s easiest to make a local copy of the
reference before any manipulations. Here&rsquo;s an
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Scalar::Util
&quot;blessed&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval { ... ; die

} <br>
else { <br>
# handle all other possible exceptions <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because Perl stringifies
uncaught exception messages before display, you&rsquo;ll

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can arrange for a callback
to be run just before the &quot;die&quot; does its deed, by

&quot;die&quot; again. See &quot;%SIG&quot; in perlvar for
details on setting %SIG entries, and &quot;eval BLOCK&quot;
for some examples. Although <br>
this feature was to be run only right before your program
was to exit, this is not currently so: the $SIG{__DIE__}
hook is currently called even inside eval()ed <br>

situations, put</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">die @_ if $^S;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do BLOCK <br>
Not really a function. Returns the value of the last command
in the sequence of commands indicated by BLOCK. When
modified by the &quot;while&quot; or &quot;until&quot; loop
modifier, executes <br>
the BLOCK once before testing the loop condition. (On other
statements the loop modifiers test the conditional
first.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;do BLOCK&quot; does not
count as a loop, so the loop control statements
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, or &quot;redo&quot;
cannot be used to leave or restart the block. See perlsyn
for alternative <br>
strategies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do SUBROUTINE(LIST) <br>
This form of subroutine call is deprecated. SUBROUTINE can
be a bareword, a scalar variable or a subroutine beginning
with &quot;&amp;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do EXPR <br>
Uses the value of EXPR as a filename and executes the
contents of the file as a Perl script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do &rsquo;stat.pl&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is just like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &lsquo;cat
stat.pl&lsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that it&rsquo;s more
efficient and concise, keeps track of the current filename
for error messages, searches the @INC directories, and
updates %INC if the file is found. <br>
See &quot;@INC&quot; in perlvar and &quot;%INC&quot; in
perlvar for these variables. It also differs in that code
evaluated with &quot;do FILENAME&quot; cannot see lexicals
in the enclosing scope; &quot;eval <br>
STRING&quot; does. It&rsquo;s the same, however, in that it
does reparse the file every time you call it, so you
probably don&rsquo;t want to do this inside a loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;do&quot; can read the
file but cannot compile it, it returns &quot;undef&quot; and
sets an error message in $@. If &quot;do&quot; cannot read
the file, it returns undef and sets $! to the error. <br>
Always check $@ first, as compilation could fail in a way
that also sets $!. If the file is successfully compiled,
&quot;do&quot; returns the value of the last expression
evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inclusion of library modules is
better done with the &quot;use&quot; and &quot;require&quot;
operators, which also do automatic error checking and raise
an exception if there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might like to use
&quot;do&quot; to read in a program configuration file.
Manual error checking can be done this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump LABEL <br>
dump <br>
This function causes an immediate core dump. See also the -u
command-line switch in perlrun, which does the same thing.
Primarily this is so that you can use the undump <br>
program (not supplied) to turn your core dump into an
executable binary after having initialized all your
variables at the beginning of the program. When the new
binary is <br>
executed it will begin by executing a &quot;goto LABEL&quot;
(with all the restrictions that &quot;goto&quot; suffers).
Think of it as a goto with an intervening core dump and
reincarnation. <br>
If &quot;LABEL&quot; is omitted, restarts the program from
the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Any files opened at the
time of the dump will not be open any more when the program
is reincarnated, with possible resulting confusion by
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function is now largely
obsolete, mostly because it&rsquo;s very hard to convert a
core file into an executable. That&rsquo;s why you should
now invoke it as &quot;CORE::dump()&quot;, if you <br>
don&rsquo;t want to be warned against a possible typo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;dump&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">each HASH <br>
each ARRAY <br>
each EXPR <br>
When called on a hash in list context, returns a 2-element
list consisting of the key and value for the next element of
a hash. In Perl 5.12 and later only, it will also <br>
return the index and value for the next element of an array
so that you can iterate over it; older Perls consider this a
syntax error. When called in scalar context, returns <br>
only the key (not the value) in a hash, or the index in an
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash entries are returned in an
apparently random order. The actual random order is subject
to change in future versions of Perl, but it is guaranteed
to be in the same <br>
order as either the &quot;keys&quot; or &quot;values&quot;
function would produce on the same (unmodified) hash. Since
Perl 5.8.2 the ordering can be different even between
different runs of <br>
Perl for security reasons (see &quot;Algorithmic Complexity
Attacks&quot; in perlsec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After &quot;each&quot; has
returned all entries from the hash or array, the next call
to &quot;each&quot; returns the empty list in list context
and &quot;undef&quot; in scalar context; the next call <br>
following that one restarts iteration. Each hash or array
has its own internal iterator, accessed by &quot;each&quot;,
&quot;keys&quot;, and &quot;values&quot;. The iterator is
implicitly reset when <br>
&quot;each&quot; has reached the end as just described; it
can be explicitly reset by calling &quot;keys&quot; or
&quot;values&quot; on the hash or array. If you add or
delete a hash&rsquo;s elements while <br>
iterating over it, entries may be skipped or duplicated--so
don&rsquo;t do that. Exception: In the current
implementation, it is always safe to delete the item most
recently <br>
returned by &quot;each()&quot;, so the following code works
properly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (($key, $value) = each
%hash) { <br>
print $key, &quot;0; <br>
delete $hash{$key}; # This is safe <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prints out your environment
like the printenv(1) program, but in a different order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (($key,$value) = each
%ENV) { <br>
print &quot;$key=$value0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,
&quot;each&quot; can take a scalar EXPR, which must hold
reference to an unblessed hash or array. The argument will
be dereferenced automatically. This <br>
aspect of &quot;each&quot; is considered highly
experimental. The exact behaviour may change in a future
version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (($key,$value) = each
$hashref) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be
users of your code who are running earlier versions of Perl
with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of thing at the
top of your file to <br>
signal that your code will work only on Perls of a recent
vintage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.012; # so keys/values/each
work on arrays <br>
use 5.014; # so keys/values/each work on scalars
(experimental)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;keys&quot;,
&quot;values&quot;, and &quot;sort&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof FILEHANDLE <br>
eof () <br>
eof Returns 1 if the next read on FILEHANDLE will return end
of file or if FILEHANDLE is not open. FILEHANDLE may be an
expression whose value gives the real filehandle. (Note <br>
that this function actually reads a character and then
&quot;ungetc&quot;s it, so isn&rsquo;t useful in an
interactive context.) Do not read from a terminal file (or
call &quot;eof(FILEHANDLE)&quot; <br>
on it) after end-of-file is reached. File types such as
terminals may lose the end-of-file condition if you do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;eof&quot; without an
argument uses the last file read. Using &quot;eof()&quot;
with empty parentheses is different. It refers to the pseudo
file formed from the files listed on the <br>
command line and accessed via the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
operator. Since &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; isn&rsquo;t explicitly
opened, as a normal filehandle is, an &quot;eof()&quot;
before &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; has been used will cause @ARGV
to be <br>
examined to determine if input is available. Similarly, an
&quot;eof()&quot; after &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; has returned
end-of-file will assume you are processing another @ARGV
list, and if you haven&rsquo;t <br>
set @ARGV, will read input from &quot;STDIN&quot;; see
&quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a &quot;while
(&lt;&gt;)&quot; loop, &quot;eof&quot; or
&quot;eof(ARGV)&quot; can be used to detect the end of each
file, whereas &quot;eof()&quot; will detect the end of the
very last file only. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># reset line numbering on each
input file <br>
while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
next if /^#/; # skip comments <br>
print &quot;$.$_&quot;; <br>
} continue { <br>
close ARGV if eof; # Not eof()! <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># insert dashes just before last
line of last file <br>
while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
if (eof()) { # check for end of last file <br>
print &quot;--------------0; <br>
} <br>
print; <br>
last if eof(); # needed if we&rsquo;re reading from a
terminal <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Practical hint: you almost never
need to use &quot;eof&quot; in Perl, because the input
operators typically return &quot;undef&quot; when they run
out of data or encounter an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval EXPR <br>
eval BLOCK <br>
eval <br>
In the first form, the return value of EXPR is parsed and
executed as if it were a little Perl program. The value of
the expression (which is itself determined within scalar
<br>
context) is first parsed, and if there were no errors,
executed as a block within the lexical context of the
current Perl program. This means, that in particular, any
outer <br>
lexical variables are visible to it, and any package
variable settings or subroutine and format definitions
remain afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the value is parsed
every time the &quot;eval&quot; executes. If EXPR is
omitted, evaluates $_. This form is typically used to delay
parsing and subsequent execution of the <br>
text of EXPR until run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;unicode_eval&quot;
feature is enabled (which is the default under a &quot;use
5.16&quot; or higher declaration), EXPR or $_ is treated as
a string of characters, so &quot;use utf8&quot; <br>
declarations have no effect, and source filters are
forbidden. In the absence of the &quot;unicode_eval&quot;
feature, the string will sometimes be treated as characters
and sometimes <br>
as bytes, depending on the internal encoding, and source
filters activated within the &quot;eval&quot; exhibit the
erratic, but historical, behaviour of affecting some outer
file scope <br>
that is still compiling. See also the &quot;evalbytes&quot;
keyword, which always treats its input as a byte stream and
works properly with source filters, and the feature
pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second form, the code
within the BLOCK is parsed only once--at the same time the
code surrounding the &quot;eval&quot; itself was parsed--and
executed within the context of the <br>
current Perl program. This form is typically used to trap
exceptions more efficiently than the first (see below),
while also providing the benefit of checking the code <br>
within BLOCK at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final semicolon, if any, may
be omitted from the value of EXPR or within the BLOCK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both forms, the value
returned is the value of the last expression evaluated
inside the mini-program; a return statement may be also
used, just as with subroutines. The <br>
expression providing the return value is evaluated in void,
scalar, or list context, depending on the context of the
&quot;eval&quot; itself. See &quot;wantarray&quot; for more
on how the <br>
evaluation context can be determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a syntax error or
runtime error, or a &quot;die&quot; statement is executed,
&quot;eval&quot; returns &quot;undef&quot; in scalar context
or an empty list in list context, and $@ is set to the <br>
error message. (Prior to 5.16, a bug caused
&quot;undef&quot; to be returned in list context for syntax
errors, but not for runtime errors.) If there was no error,
$@ is set to the <br>
empty string. A control flow operator like &quot;last&quot;
or &quot;goto&quot; can bypass the setting of $@. Beware
that using &quot;eval&quot; neither silences Perl from
printing warnings to STDERR, <br>
nor does it stuff the text of warning messages into $@. To
do either of those, you have to use the $SIG{__WARN__}
facility, or turn off warnings inside the BLOCK or EXPR <br>
using &quot;no warnings &rsquo;all&rsquo;&quot;. See
&quot;warn&quot;, perlvar, warnings and perllexwarn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, because
&quot;eval&quot; traps otherwise-fatal errors, it is useful
for determining whether a particular feature (such as
&quot;socket&quot; or &quot;symlink&quot;) is implemented.
It is also <br>
Perl&rsquo;s exception-trapping mechanism, where the die
operator is used to raise exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to trap errors when
loading an XS module, some problems with the binary
interface (such as Perl version skew) may be fatal even with
&quot;eval&quot; unless <br>
$ENV{PERL_DL_NONLAZY} is set. See perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the code to be executed
doesn&rsquo;t vary, you may use the eval-BLOCK form to trap
run-time errors without incurring the penalty of recompiling
each time. The error, if any, <br>
is still returned in $@. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># make divide-by-zero nonfatal
<br>
eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># same thing, but less efficient
<br>
eval &rsquo;$answer = $a / $b&rsquo;; warn $@ if $@;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># a compile-time error <br>
eval { $answer = }; # WRONG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># a run-time error <br>
eval &rsquo;$answer =&rsquo;; # sets $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the &quot;eval{}&quot;
form as an exception trap in libraries does have some
issues. Due to the current arguably broken state of
&quot;__DIE__&quot; hooks, you may wish not to trigger any
<br>
&quot;__DIE__&quot; hooks that user code may have installed.
You can use the &quot;local $SIG{__DIE__}&quot; construct
for this purpose, as this example shows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># a private exception trap for
divide-by-zero <br>
eval { local $SIG{&rsquo;__DIE__&rsquo;}; $answer = $a / $b;
}; <br>
warn $@ if $@;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is especially significant,
given that &quot;__DIE__&quot; hooks can call
&quot;die&quot; again, which has the effect of changing
their error messages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># __DIE__ hooks may modify error
messages <br>
{ <br>
local $SIG{&rsquo;__DIE__&rsquo;} = <br>
sub { (my $x = $_[0]) =~ s/foo/bar/g; die $x }; <br>
eval { die &quot;foo lives here&quot; }; <br>
print $@ if $@; # prints &quot;bar lives here&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because this promotes action at
a distance, this counterintuitive behavior may be fixed in a
future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With an &quot;eval&quot;, you
should be especially careful to remember what&rsquo;s being
looked at when:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $x; # CASE 1 <br>
eval &quot;$x&quot;; # CASE 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &rsquo;$x&rsquo;; # CASE 3
<br>
eval { $x }; # CASE 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &quot;x++&quot;; # CASE 5
<br>
$$x++; # CASE 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cases 1 and 2 above behave
identically: they run the code contained in the variable $x.
(Although case 2 has misleading double quotes making the
reader wonder what else <br>
might be happening (nothing is).) Cases 3 and 4 likewise
behave in the same way: they run the code &rsquo;$x&rsquo;,
which does nothing but return the value of $x. (Case 4 is
preferred <br>
for purely visual reasons, but it also has the advantage of
compiling at compile-time instead of at run-time.) Case 5 is
a place where normally you would like to use double <br>
quotes, except that in this particular situation, you can
just use symbolic references instead, as in case 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Perl 5.14, the assignment
to $@ occurred before restoration of localized variables,
which means that for your code to run on older versions, a
temporary is required if <br>
you want to mask some but not all errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># alter $@ on nefarious
repugnancy only <br>
{ <br>
my $e; <br>
{ <br>
local $@; # protect existing $@ <br>
eval { test_repugnancy() }; <br>
# $@ =~ /nefarious/ and die $@; # Perl 5.14 and higher only
<br>
$@ =~ /nefarious/ and $e = $@; <br>
} <br>
die $e if defined $e <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eval BLOCK&quot; does not
count as a loop, so the loop control statements
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, or &quot;redo&quot;
cannot be used to leave or restart the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;eval
&rsquo;&rsquo;&quot; executed within the &quot;DB&quot;
package doesn&rsquo;t see the usual surrounding lexical
scope, but rather the scope of the first non-DB piece of
code that called it. You <br>
don&rsquo;t normally need to worry about this unless you are
writing a Perl debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">evalbytes EXPR <br>
evalbytes <br>
This function is like &quot;eval&quot; with a string
argument, except it always parses its argument, or $_ if
EXPR is omitted, as a string of bytes. A string containing
characters <br>
whose ordinal value exceeds 255 results in an error. Source
filters activated within the evaluated code apply to the
code itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function is only available
under the &quot;evalbytes&quot; feature, a &quot;use
v5.16&quot; (or higher) declaration, or with a
&quot;CORE::&quot; prefix. See feature for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec LIST <br>
exec PROGRAM LIST <br>
The &quot;exec&quot; function executes a system command and
never returns; use &quot;system&quot; instead of
&quot;exec&quot; if you want it to return. It fails and
returns false only if the command does <br>
not exist and it is executed directly instead of via your
system&rsquo;s command shell (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since it&rsquo;s a common
mistake to use &quot;exec&quot; instead of
&quot;system&quot;, Perl warns you if &quot;exec&quot; is
called in void context and if there is a following statement
that isn&rsquo;t &quot;die&quot;, <br>
&quot;warn&quot;, or &quot;exit&quot; (if &quot;-w&quot; is
set--but you always do that, right?). If you really want to
follow an &quot;exec&quot; with some other statement, you
can use one of these styles to <br>
avoid the warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec (&rsquo;foo&rsquo;) or
print STDERR &quot;couldn&rsquo;t exec foo: $!&quot;; <br>
{ exec (&rsquo;foo&rsquo;) }; print STDERR
&quot;couldn&rsquo;t exec foo: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is more than one
argument in LIST, or if LIST is an array with more than one
value, calls execvp(3) with the arguments in LIST. If there
is only one scalar argument <br>
or an array with one element in it, the argument is checked
for shell metacharacters, and if there are any, the entire
argument is passed to the system&rsquo;s command shell for
<br>
parsing (this is &quot;/bin/sh -c&quot; on Unix platforms,
but varies on other platforms). If there are no shell
metacharacters in the argument, it is split into words and
passed <br>
directly to &quot;execvp&quot;, which is more efficient.
Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec &rsquo;/bin/echo&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Your arguments are: &rsquo;, @ARGV; <br>
exec &quot;sort $outfile | uniq&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t really want
to execute the first argument, but want to lie to the
program you are executing about its own name, you can
specify the program you actually want to <br>
run as an &quot;indirect object&quot; (without a comma) in
front of the LIST. (This always forces interpretation of the
LIST as a multivalued list, even if there is only a single
<br>
scalar in the list.) Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$shell = &rsquo;/bin/csh&rsquo;;
<br>
exec $shell &rsquo;-sh&rsquo;; # pretend it&rsquo;s a login
shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or, more directly,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec {&rsquo;/bin/csh&rsquo;}
&rsquo;-sh&rsquo;; # pretend it&rsquo;s a login shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the arguments get executed
via the system shell, results are subject to its quirks and
capabilities. See &quot;&lsquo;STRING&lsquo;&quot; in perlop
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using an indirect object with
&quot;exec&quot; or &quot;system&quot; is also more secure.
This usage (which also works fine with system()) forces
interpretation of the arguments as a <br>
multivalued list, even if the list had just one argument.
That way you&rsquo;re safe from the shell expanding
wildcards or splitting up words with whitespace in them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@args = ( &quot;echo
surprise&quot; );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec @args; # subject to shell
escapes <br>
# if @args == 1 <br>
exec { $args[0] } @args; # safe even with one-arg list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first version, the one
without the indirect object, ran the echo program, passing
it &quot;surprise&quot; an argument. The second version
didn&rsquo;t; it tried to run a program named <br>
&quot;echo surprise&quot;, didn&rsquo;t find it, and set $?
to a non-zero value indicating failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl
attempts to flush all files opened for output before the
exec, but this may not be supported on some platforms (see
perlport). To be safe, you <br>
may need to set $| ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call the
&quot;autoflush()&quot; method of &quot;IO::Handle&quot; on
any open handles to avoid lost output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;exec&quot; will
not call your &quot;END&quot; blocks, nor will it invoke
&quot;DESTROY&quot; methods on your objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exists EXPR <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the most deeply nested

Thus &quot;$ref-&gt;{&quot;A&quot;}&quot; and <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit EXPR <br>
exit <br>
Evaluates EXPR and exits immediately with that value.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ans = &lt;STDIN&gt;; <br>
exit 0 if $ans =~ /^[Xx]/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;die&quot;. If
EXPR is omitted, exits with 0 status. The only universally
recognized values for EXPR are 0 for success and 1 for
error; other values are subject to <br>
interpretation depending on the environment in which the
Perl program is running. For example, exiting 69
(EX_UNAVAILABLE) from a sendmail incoming-mail filter will
cause <br>
the mailer to return the item undelivered, but that&rsquo;s
not true everywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t use &quot;exit&quot;
to abort a subroutine if there&rsquo;s any chance that
someone might want to trap whatever error happened. Use
&quot;die&quot; instead, which can be trapped by an
&quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit() function does not
always exit immediately. It calls any defined
&quot;END&quot; routines first, but these &quot;END&quot;
routines may not themselves abort the exit. Likewise any
<br>
object destructors that need to be called are called before
the real exit. &quot;END&quot; routines and destructors can
change the exit status by modifying $?. If this is a
problem, <br>
you can call &quot;POSIX::_exit($status)&quot; to avoid END
and destructor processing. See perlmod for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exp EXPR <br>
exp Returns e (the natural logarithm base) to the power of
EXPR. If EXPR is omitted, gives &quot;exp($_)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc EXPR <br>
fc Returns the casefolded version of EXPR. This is the
internal function implementing the &quot; escape in
double-quoted strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Casefolding is the process of
mapping strings to a form where case differences are erased;
comparing two strings in their casefolded form is
effectively a way of asking if <br>
two strings are equal, regardless of case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Roughly, if you ever found
yourself writing this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lc($this) eq lc($that) # Wrong!
<br>
# or <br>
uc($this) eq uc($that) # Also wrong! <br>
# or <br>
$this =~ /Q$that/i # Right!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now you can write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fc($this) eq fc($that)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And get the correct results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl only implements the full
form of casefolding. For further information on casefolding,
refer to the Unicode Standard, specifically sections 3.13
&quot;Default Case <br>
Operations&quot;, 4.2 &quot;Case-Normative&quot;, and 5.18

the Case Charts available at <br>
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/charts/case/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EXPR is omitted, uses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function behaves the same
way under various pragma, such as in a locale, as
&quot;lc&quot; does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the Unicode Standard
defines two additional forms of casefolding, one for Turkic
languages and one that never maps one character into
multiple characters, these are not <br>
provided by the Perl core; However, the CPAN module
&quot;Unicode::Casing&quot; may be used to provide an
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcntl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR
<br>
Implements the fcntl(2) function. You&rsquo;ll probably have
to say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Fcntl;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first to get the correct
constant definitions. Argument processing and value returned
work just like &quot;ioctl&quot; below. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Fcntl; <br>
fcntl($filehandle, F_GETFL, $packed_return_buffer) <br>
or die &quot;can&rsquo;t fcntl F_GETFL: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t have to check
for &quot;defined&quot; on the return from
&quot;fcntl&quot;. Like &quot;ioctl&quot;, it maps a 0
return from the system call into &quot;0 but true&quot; in
Perl. This string is true in <br>
boolean context and 0 in numeric context. It is also exempt
from the normal -w warnings on improper numeric
conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;fcntl&quot;
raises an exception if used on a machine that doesn&rsquo;t
implement fcntl(2). See the Fcntl module or your fcntl(2)
manpage to learn what functions are <br>
available on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__FILE__ <br>
A special token that returns the name of the file in which
it occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fileno FILEHANDLE <br>
Returns the file descriptor for a filehandle, or undefined
if the filehandle is not open. If there is no real file
descriptor at the OS level, as can happen with filehandles
<br>
connected to memory objects via &quot;open&quot; with a
reference for the third argument, -1 is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is mainly useful for
constructing bitmaps for &quot;select&quot; and low-level
POSIX tty-handling operations. If FILEHANDLE is an
expression, the value is taken as an indirect <br>
filehandle, generally its name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this to find out
whether two handles refer to the same underlying
descriptor:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (fileno(THIS) ==
fileno(THAT)) { <br>
print &quot;THIS and THAT are dups0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flock FILEHANDLE,OPERATION <br>
Calls flock(2), or an emulation of it, on FILEHANDLE.
Returns true for success, false on failure. Produces a fatal
error if used on a machine that doesn&rsquo;t implement <br>
flock(2), fcntl(2) locking, or lockf(3). &quot;flock&quot;
is Perl&rsquo;s portable file-locking interface, although it
locks entire files only, not records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two potentially non-obvious but
traditional &quot;flock&quot; semantics are that it waits
indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks
are merely advisory. Such <br>
discretionary locks are more flexible, but offer fewer
guarantees. This means that programs that do not also use
&quot;flock&quot; may modify files locked with
&quot;flock&quot;. See perlport, <br>
your port&rsquo;s specific documentation, and your
system-specific local manpages for details. It&rsquo;s best
to assume traditional behavior if you&rsquo;re writing
portable programs. (But <br>
if you&rsquo;re not, you should as always feel perfectly
free to write for your own system&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies
(sometimes called &quot;features&quot;). Slavish adherence
to portability <br>
concerns shouldn&rsquo;t get in the way of your getting your
job done.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION is one of LOCK_SH,
LOCK_EX, or LOCK_UN, possibly combined with LOCK_NB. These
constants are traditionally valued 1, 2, 8 and 4, but you
can use the symbolic names <br>
if you import them from the Fcntl module, either
individually, or as a group using the &quot;:flock&quot;
tag. LOCK_SH requests a shared lock, LOCK_EX requests an
exclusive lock, and <br>
LOCK_UN releases a previously requested lock. If LOCK_NB is
bitwise-or&rsquo;ed with LOCK_SH or LOCK_EX, then
&quot;flock&quot; returns immediately rather than blocking
waiting for the <br>
lock; check the return status to see if you got it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid the possibility of
miscoordination, Perl now flushes FILEHANDLE before locking
or unlocking it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the emulation built
with lockf(3) doesn&rsquo;t provide shared locks, and it
requires that FILEHANDLE be open with write intent. These
are the semantics that lockf(3) <br>
implements. Most if not all systems implement lockf(3) in
terms of fcntl(2) locking, though, so the differing
semantics shouldn&rsquo;t bite too many people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the fcntl(2) emulation
of flock(3) requires that FILEHANDLE be open with read
intent to use LOCK_SH and requires that it be open with
write intent to use LOCK_EX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that some versions of
&quot;flock&quot; cannot lock things over the network; you
would need to use the more system-specific &quot;fcntl&quot;
for that. If you like you can force Perl <br>
to ignore your system&rsquo;s flock(2) function, and so
provide its own fcntl(2)-based emulation, by passing the
switch &quot;-Ud_flock&quot; to the Configure program when
you configure and <br>
build a new Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a mailbox appender

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support a real
flock(2), locks are inherited across fork() calls, whereas
those that must resort to the more capricious fcntl(2)
function lose their locks, <br>
making it seriously harder to write servers.</p>

flock() examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fork <br>
Does a fork(2) system call to create a new process running
the same program at the same point. It returns the child pid
to the parent process, 0 to the child process, or <br>
&quot;undef&quot; if the fork is unsuccessful. File
descriptors (and sometimes locks on those descriptors) are
shared, while everything else is copied. On most systems
supporting <br>
fork(), great care has gone into making it extremely
efficient (for example, using copy-on-write technology on
data pages), making it the dominant paradigm for
multitasking <br>
over the last few decades.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl
attempts to flush all files opened for output before forking
the child process, but this may not be supported on some
platforms (see perlport). <br>
To be safe, you may need to set $| ($AUTOFLUSH in English)
or call the &quot;autoflush()&quot; method of
&quot;IO::Handle&quot; on any open handles to avoid
duplicate output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you &quot;fork&quot; without
ever waiting on your children, you will accumulate zombies.
On some systems, you can avoid this by setting $SIG{CHLD} to
&quot;IGNORE&quot;. See also perlipc <br>
for more examples of forking and reaping moribund
children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if your forked child
inherits system file descriptors like STDIN and STDOUT that
are actually connected by a pipe or socket, even if you
exit, then the remote <br>
server (such as, say, a CGI script or a backgrounded job
launched from a remote shell) won&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re
done. You should reopen those to /dev/null if it&rsquo;s any
issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms such as
Windows, where the fork() system call is not available, Perl
can be built to emulate fork() in the Perl interpreter. The
emulation is designed, at <br>
the level of the Perl program, to be as compatible as
possible with the &quot;Unix&quot; fork(). However it has
limitations that have to be considered in code intended to
be portable. <br>
See perlfork for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format <br>
Declare a picture format for use by the &quot;write&quot;
function. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format Something = <br>
Test: @&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; @|||||
@&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
$str, $%, &rsquo;$&rsquo; . int($num) <br>
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$str = &quot;widget&quot;; <br>
$num = $cost/$quantity; <br>
$~ = &rsquo;Something&rsquo;; <br>
write;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlform for many details
and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">formline PICTURE,LIST <br>
This is an internal function used by &quot;format&quot;s,
though you may call it, too. It formats (see perlform) a
list of values according to the contents of PICTURE, placing
the <br>
output into the format output accumulator, $^A (or
$ACCUMULATOR in English). Eventually, when a
&quot;write&quot; is done, the contents of $^A are written
to some filehandle. You <br>
could also read $^A and then set $^A back to &quot;&quot;.
Note that a format typically does one &quot;formline&quot;
per line of form, but the &quot;formline&quot; function
itself doesn&rsquo;t care how many <br>
newlines are embedded in the PICTURE. This means that the
&quot;~&quot; and &quot;~~&quot; tokens treat the entire
PICTURE as a single line. You may therefore need to use
multiple formlines to <br>
implement a single record format, just like the
&quot;format&quot; compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful if you put double
quotes around the picture, because an &quot;@&quot;
character may be taken to mean the beginning of an array
name. &quot;formline&quot; always returns true. See <br>
perlform for other examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are trying to use this
instead of &quot;write&quot; to capture the output, you may
find it easier to open a filehandle to a scalar (&quot;open
$fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, utput&quot;) and write to that <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getc FILEHANDLE <br>
getc <br>
Returns the next character from the input file attached to
FILEHANDLE, or the undefined value at end of file or if
there was an error (in the latter case $! is set). If <br>
FILEHANDLE is omitted, reads from STDIN. This is not
particularly efficient. However, it cannot be used by itself
to fetch single characters without waiting for the user to
<br>
hit enter. For that, try something more like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($BSD_STYLE) { <br>
system &quot;stty cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty
2&gt;&amp;1&quot;; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
system &quot;stty&quot;, &rsquo;-icanon&rsquo;,
&rsquo;eol&rsquo;, &quot; 01&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$key = getc(STDIN);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($BSD_STYLE) { <br>
system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty
2&gt;&amp;1&quot;; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
system &rsquo;stty&rsquo;, &rsquo;icanon&rsquo;,
&rsquo;eol&rsquo;, &rsquo;^@&rsquo;; # ASCII NUL <br>
} <br>
print &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determination of whether
$BSD_STYLE should be set is left as an exercise to the
reader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;POSIX::getattr&quot;

omitted, returns the process group of the current process.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If the entry doesn&rsquo;t
exist you get an empty list.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact meaning of the $gcos
field varies but it usually contains the real name of the
user (as opposed to the login name) and other information
pertaining to the user. <br>
Beware, however, that in many system users are able to
change this information and therefore it cannot be trusted
and therefore the $gcos is tainted (see perlsec). The <br>
$passwd and $shell, user&rsquo;s encrypted password and
login shell, are also tainted, for the same reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In scalar context, you get the
name, unless the function was a lookup by name, in which
case you get the other thing, whatever it is. (If the entry
doesn&rsquo;t exist you get the <br>
undefined value.) For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$uid = getpwnam($name); <br>
$name = getpwuid($num); <br>
$name = getpwent(); <br>
$gid = getgrnam($name); <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In getpw*() the fields $quota,
$comment, and $expire are special in that they are
unsupported on many systems. If the $quota is unsupported,
it is an empty scalar. If it is <br>
supported, it usually encodes the disk quota. If the
$comment field is unsupported, it is an empty scalar. If it
is supported it usually encodes some administrative comment
<br>
about the user. In some systems the $quota field may be
$change or $age, fields that have to do with password aging.
In some systems the $comment field may be $class. The <br>
$expire field, if present, encodes the expiration period of
the account or the password. For the availability and the
exact meaning of these fields in your system, please <br>
consult getpwnam(3) and your system&rsquo;s pwd.h file. You
can also find out from within Perl what your $quota and
$comment fields mean and whether you have the $expire field
by <br>
using the &quot;Config&quot; module and the values
&quot;d_pwquota&quot;, &quot;d_pwage&quot;,
&quot;d_pwchange&quot;, &quot;d_pwcomment&quot;, and
&quot;d_pwexpire&quot;. Shadow password files are supported
only if your vendor has <br>
implemented them in the intuitive fashion that calling the
regular C library routines gets the shadow versions if
you&rsquo;re running under privilege or if there exists the
<br>
shadow(3) functions as found in System V (this includes
Solaris and Linux). Those systems that implement a
proprietary shadow password facility are unlikely to be
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($a,$b,$c,$d) =
unpack(&rsquo;W4&rsquo;,$addr[0]);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Socket library makes this
slightly easier:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Socket; <br>
$iaddr = inet_aton(&quot;127.1&quot;); # or whatever address
<br>
$name = gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># or going the other way <br>
$straddr = inet_ntoa($iaddr);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the opposite way, to resolve
a hostname to the IP address you can write this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Socket; <br>
$packed_ip = gethostbyname(&quot;www.perl.org&quot;); <br>

precedence of a list operator, so beware:</p>

&quot;Net::protoent&quot;, &quot;Net::servent&quot;,
&quot;Time::gmtime&quot;, &quot;Time::localtime&quot;, and
&quot;User::grent&quot;. These override the normal
built-ins, supplying versions <br>
that return objects with the appropriate names for each
field. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use File::stat; <br>
use User::pwent; <br>
$is_his = (stat($filename)-&gt;uid ==
pwent($whoever)-&gt;uid);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though it looks as though
they&rsquo;re the same method calls (uid), they
aren&rsquo;t, because a &quot;File::stat&quot; object is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getsockname SOCKET <br>
Returns the packed sockaddr address of this end of the
SOCKET connection, in case you don&rsquo;t know the address
because you have several different IPs that the connection
might <br>
have come in on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getsockopt SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME
<br>
Queries the option named OPTNAME associated with SOCKET at a
given LEVEL. Options may exist at multiple protocol levels
depending on the socket type, but at least the <br>
uppermost socket level SOL_SOCKET (defined in the
&quot;Socket&quot; module) will exist. To query options at
another level the protocol number of the appropriate
protocol controlling <br>
the option should be supplied. For example, to indicate that
an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, LEVEL
should be set to the protocol number of TCP, which you <br>
can get using &quot;getprotobyname&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function returns a packed
string representing the requested socket option, or
&quot;undef&quot; on error, with the reason for the error
placed in $!. Just what is in the packed <br>
string depends on LEVEL and OPTNAME; consult getsockopt(2)
for details. A common case is that the option is an integer,
in which case the result is a packed integer, which <br>
you can decode using &quot;unpack&quot; with the
&quot;i&quot; (or &quot;I&quot;) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glob EXPR <br>
glob <br>
In list context, returns a (possibly empty) list of filename
expansions on the value of EXPR such as the standard Unix
shell /bin/csh would do. In scalar context, glob <br>
iterates through such filename expansions, returning undef
when the list is exhausted. This is the internal function
implementing the &quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot; operator, but you
can use it <br>
directly. If EXPR is omitted, $_ is used. The
&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot; operator is discussed in more detail
in &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;glob&quot;
splits its arguments on whitespace and treats each segment
as separate pattern. As such, &quot;glob(&quot;*.c
*.h&quot;)&quot; matches all files with a .c or .h
extension. The <br>
expression &quot;glob(&quot;.* *&quot;)&quot; matches all
files in the current working directory. If you want to glob
filenames that might contain whitespace, you&rsquo;ll have
to use extra quotes <br>
around the spacey filename to protect it. For example, to
glob filenames that have an &quot;e&quot; followed by a
space followed by an &quot;f&quot;, use either of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@spacies = &lt;&quot;*e
f*&quot;&gt;; <br>
@spacies = glob &rsquo;&quot;*e f*&quot;&rsquo;; <br>
@spacies = glob q(&quot;*e f*&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you had to get a variable
through, you could do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@spacies = glob
&quot;&rsquo;*${var}e f*&rsquo;&quot;; <br>
@spacies = glob qq(&quot;*${var}e f*&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If non-empty braces are the only
wildcard characters used in the &quot;glob&quot;, no
filenames are matched, but potentially many strings are
returned. For example, this produces nine <br>
strings, one for each pairing of fruits and colors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@many = glob
&quot;{apple,tomato,cherry}={green,yellow,red}&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with v5.6.0, this
operator is implemented using the standard
&quot;File::Glob&quot; extension. See File::Glob for
details, including &quot;bsd_glob&quot; which does not treat

whitespace as a pattern separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto LABEL <br>
goto EXPR <br>
goto &amp;NAME <br>
The &quot;goto-LABEL&quot; form finds the statement labeled
with LABEL and resumes execution there. It can&rsquo;t be
used to get out of a block or subroutine given to
&quot;sort&quot;. It can be <br>
used to go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope,
including out of subroutines, but it&rsquo;s usually better
to use some other construct such as &quot;last&quot; or
&quot;die&quot;. The <br>
author of Perl has never felt the need to use this form of
&quot;goto&quot; (in Perl, that is; C is another matter).
(The difference is that C does not offer named loops
combined with <br>
loop control. Perl does, and this replaces most structured
uses of &quot;goto&quot; in other languages.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;goto-EXPR&quot; form
expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically. This allows for computed &quot;goto&quot;s per
FORTRAN, but isn&rsquo;t necessarily recommended if <br>
you&rsquo;re optimizing for maintainability:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto (&quot;FOO&quot;,
&quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As shown in this example,
&quot;goto-EXPR&quot; is exempt from the &quot;looks like a
function&quot; rule. A pair of parentheses following it does
not (necessarily) delimit its argument. <br>
&quot;goto(&quot;NE&quot;).&quot;XT&quot;&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;goto NEXT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of &quot;goto-LABEL&quot; or
&quot;goto-EXPR&quot; to jump into a construct is deprecated
and will issue a warning. Even then, it may not be used to
go into any construct that requires <br>
initialization, such as a subroutine or a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop. It also can&rsquo;t be used to go
into a construct that is optimized away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;goto-&amp;NAME&quot;
form is quite different from the other forms of
&quot;goto&quot;. In fact, it isn&rsquo;t a goto in the
normal sense at all, and doesn&rsquo;t have the stigma
associated with <br>
other gotos. Instead, it exits the current subroutine
(losing any changes set by local()) and immediately calls in
its place the named subroutine using the current value of
<br>
@_. This is used by &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutines that
wish to load another subroutine and then pretend that the
other subroutine had been called in the first place (except
that <br>
any modifications to @_ in the current subroutine are
propagated to the other subroutine.) After the
&quot;goto&quot;, not even &quot;caller&quot; will be able
to tell that this routine was <br>
called first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME needn&rsquo;t be the name
of a subroutine; it can be a scalar variable containing a
code reference or a block that evaluates to a code
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep BLOCK LIST <br>
grep EXPR,LIST <br>
This is similar in spirit to, but not the same as, grep(1)
and its relatives. In particular, it is not limited to using
regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for
each element of LIST (locally setting $_ to each element)
and returns the list value consisting of those elements for
which the expression <br>
evaluated to true. In scalar context, returns the number of
times the expression was true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@foo = grep(!/^#/, @bar); # weed
out comments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or equivalently,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@foo = grep {!/^#/} @bar; # weed
out comments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that $_ is an alias to the
list value, so it can be used to modify the elements of the
LIST. While this is useful and supported, it can cause
bizarre results if the <br>
elements of LIST are not variables. Similarly, grep returns
aliases into the original list, much as a for loop&rsquo;s
index variable aliases the list elements. That is, <br>
modifying an element of a list returned by grep (for
example, in a &quot;foreach&quot;, &quot;map&quot; or
another &quot;grep&quot;) actually modifies the element in
the original list. This is usually <br>
something to be avoided when writing clear code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $_ is lexical in the scope
where the &quot;grep&quot; appears (because it has been
declared with &quot;my $_&quot;) then, in addition to being
locally aliased to the list elements, $_ keeps <br>
being lexical inside the block; i.e., it can&rsquo;t be seen
from the outside, avoiding any potential side-effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;map&quot; for a
list composed of the results of the BLOCK or EXPR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hex EXPR <br>
hex Interprets EXPR as a hex string and returns the
corresponding value. (To convert strings that might start
with either 0, &quot;0x&quot;, or &quot;0b&quot;, see
&quot;oct&quot;.) If EXPR is omitted, uses <br>
$_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print hex &rsquo;0xAf&rsquo;; #
prints &rsquo;175&rsquo; <br>
print hex &rsquo;aF&rsquo;; # same</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hex strings may only represent
integers. Strings that would cause integer overflow trigger
a warning. Leading whitespace is not stripped, unlike oct().
To present <br>
something as hex, look into &quot;printf&quot;,
&quot;sprintf&quot;, and &quot;unpack&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import LIST <br>
There is no builtin &quot;import&quot; function. It is just
an ordinary method (subroutine) defined (or inherited) by
modules that wish to export names to another module. The
&quot;use&quot; <br>
function calls the &quot;import&quot; method for the package
used. See also &quot;use&quot;, perlmod, and Exporter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index STR,SUBSTR,POSITION <br>
index STR,SUBSTR <br>
The index function searches for one string within another,
but without the wildcard-like behavior of a full
regular-expression pattern match. It returns the position of
the <br>
first occurrence of SUBSTR in STR at or after POSITION. If
POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of
the string. POSITION before the beginning of the <br>
string or after its end is treated as if it were the
beginning or the end, respectively. POSITION and the return
value are based at zero. If the substring is not found, <br>
&quot;index&quot; returns -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int EXPR <br>
int Returns the integer portion of EXPR. If EXPR is omitted,
uses $_. You should not use this function for rounding: one
because it truncates towards 0, and two because machine <br>
representations of floating-point numbers can sometimes
produce counterintuitive results. For example,
&quot;int(-6.725/0.025)&quot; produces -268 rather than the
correct -269; that&rsquo;s <br>
because it&rsquo;s really more like
-268.99999999999994315658 instead. Usually, the
&quot;sprintf&quot;, &quot;printf&quot;, or the
&quot;POSIX::floor&quot; and &quot;POSIX::ceil&quot;
functions will serve you better <br>
than will int().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioctl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR
<br>
Implements the ioctl(2) function. You&rsquo;ll probably
first have to say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&quot;sys/ioctl.ph&quot;; # probably in
$Config{archlib}/sys/ioctl.ph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to get the correct function
definitions. If sys/ioctl.ph doesn&rsquo;t exist or
doesn&rsquo;t have the correct definitions you&rsquo;ll have
to roll your own, based on your C header files <br>
such as &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;. (There is a Perl script called
h2ph that comes with the Perl kit that may help you in this,
but it&rsquo;s nontrivial.) SCALAR will be read and/or
written <br>
depending on the FUNCTION; a C pointer to the string value
of SCALAR will be passed as the third argument of the actual
&quot;ioctl&quot; call. (If SCALAR has no string value but
does <br>
have a numeric value, that value will be passed rather than
a pointer to the string value. To guarantee this to be true,
add a 0 to the scalar before using it.) The &quot;pack&quot;
<br>
and &quot;unpack&quot; functions may be needed to manipulate
the values of structures used by &quot;ioctl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value of
&quot;ioctl&quot; (and &quot;fcntl&quot;) is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if OS returns: then Perl
returns: <br>
-1 undefined value <br>
0 string &quot;0 but true&quot; <br>
anything else that number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus Perl returns true on
success and false on failure, yet you can still easily
determine the actual value returned by the operating
system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$retval = ioctl(...) || -1; <br>
printf &quot;System returned %d0, $retval;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special string &quot;0 but
true&quot; is exempt from -w complaints about improper
numeric conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join EXPR,LIST <br>
Joins the separate strings of LIST into a single string with
fields separated by the value of EXPR, and returns that new
string. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$rec = join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
$login,$passwd,$uid,$gid,$gcos,$home,$shell);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware that unlike
&quot;split&quot;, &quot;join&quot; doesn&rsquo;t take a
pattern as its first argument. Compare
&quot;split&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys HASH <br>
keys ARRAY <br>
keys EXPR <br>
Called in list context, returns a list consisting of all the
keys of the named hash, or in Perl 5.12 or later only, the
indices of an array. Perl releases prior to 5.12 will <br>
produce a syntax error if you try to use an array argument.
In scalar context, returns the number of keys or
indices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keys of a hash are returned
in an apparently random order. The actual random order is
subject to change in future versions of Perl, but it is
guaranteed to be the same <br>
order as either the &quot;values&quot; or &quot;each&quot;
function produces (given that the hash has not been
modified). Since Perl 5.8.1 the ordering can be different
even between different <br>
runs of Perl for security reasons (see &quot;Algorithmic
Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a side effect, calling keys()
resets the internal interator of the HASH or ARRAY (see
&quot;each&quot;). In particular, calling keys() in void
context resets the iterator with no <br>
other overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is yet another way to print
your environment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@keys = keys %ENV; <br>
@values = values %ENV; <br>
while (@keys) { <br>
print pop(@keys), &rsquo;=&rsquo;, pop(@values), &quot;0;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or how about sorted by key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
<br>
print $key, &rsquo;=&rsquo;, $ENV{$key}, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The returned values are copies
of the original keys in the hash, so modifying them will not
affect the original hash. Compare &quot;values&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To sort a hash by value,
you&rsquo;ll need to use a &quot;sort&quot; function.
Here&rsquo;s a descending numeric sort of a hash by its
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach $key (sort { $hash{$b}
&lt;=&gt; $hash{$a} } keys %hash) { <br>
printf &quot;%4d %s0, $hash{$key}, $key; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used as an lvalue,
&quot;keys&quot; allows you to increase the number of hash
buckets allocated for the given hash. This can gain you a
measure of efficiency if you know the hash is <br>
going to get big. (This is similar to pre-extending an array
by assigning a larger number to $#array.) If you say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys %hash = 200;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then %hash will have at least
200 buckets allocated for it--256 of them, in fact, since it
rounds up to the next power of two. These buckets will be
retained even if you do <br>
&quot;%hash = ()&quot;, use &quot;undef %hash&quot; if you
want to free the storage while %hash is still in scope. You
can&rsquo;t shrink the number of buckets allocated for the
hash using &quot;keys&quot; in <br>
this way (but you needn&rsquo;t worry about doing this by
accident, as trying has no effect). &quot;keys @array&quot;
in an lvalue context is a syntax error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,
&quot;keys&quot; can take a scalar EXPR, which must contain
a reference to an unblessed hash or array. The argument will
be dereferenced automatically. This <br>
aspect of &quot;keys&quot; is considered highly
experimental. The exact behaviour may change in a future
version of Perl.</p>

kill SIGNAL <br>
Sends a signal to a list of processes. Returns the number of
processes successfully signaled (which is not necessarily
the same as the number actually killed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$cnt = kill 1, $child1, $child2;
<br>
kill 9, @goners;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SIGNAL is zero, no signal is
sent to the process, but &quot;kill&quot; checks whether
it&rsquo;s possible to send a signal to it (that means, to
be brief, that the process is owned by the <br>
same user, or we are the super-user). This is useful to
check that a child process is still alive (even if only as a
zombie) and hasn&rsquo;t changed its UID. See perlport for
<br>
notes on the portability of this construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike in the shell, if SIGNAL
is negative, it kills process groups instead of processes.
That means you usually want to use positive not negative
signals. You may also use <br>
a signal name in quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of kill when a
PROCESS number is zero or negative depends on the operating
system. For example, on POSIX-conforming systems, zero will
signal the current <br>
process group and -1 will signal all processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Signals&quot; in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms such as
Windows where the fork() system call is not available. Perl

details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no LIST of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On ASCII platforms <br>
The results follow ASCII semantics. Only characters
&quot;A-Z&quot; change, to &quot;a-z&quot; respectively.</p>

(this last can only happen if the UTF8 flag is also set).
<br>
See perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A deficiency in this is that
case changes that cross the 255/256 boundary are not
well-defined. For example, the lower case of LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E) in <br>
Unicode semantics is U+00DF (on ASCII platforms). But under
&quot;use locale&quot;, the lower case of U+1E9E is itself,
because 0xDF may not be LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S in the
<br>
current locale, and Perl has no way of knowing if that
character even exists in the locale, much less what code
point it is. Perl returns the input character unchanged,
<br>
for all instances (and there aren&rsquo;t many) where the
255/256 boundary would otherwise be crossed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, If EXPR has the UTF8

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcfirst EXPR <br>
lcfirst <br>
Returns the value of EXPR with the first character

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EXPR is omitted, uses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function behaves the same

<p style="margin-top: 1em">length EXPR <br>
length <br>
Returns the length in characters of the value of EXPR. If
EXPR is omitted, returns the length of $_. If EXPR is
undefined, returns &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function cannot be used on
an entire array or hash to find out how many elements these

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local EXPR <br>
You really probably want to be using &quot;my&quot; instead,

of as &quot;local&quot;. See &quot;Private Variables via
my()&quot; in perlsub for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A local modifies the listed

If more than one value is listed, the list must be placed in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localtime EXPR <br>
localtime <br>
Converts a time as returned by the time function to a
9-element list with the time analyzed for the local time
zone. Typically used as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <br>
($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = <br>
localtime(time);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All list elements are numeric
and come straight out of the C &lsquo;struct tm&rsquo;.
$sec, $min, and $hour are the seconds, minutes, and hours of
the specified time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$mday is the day of the month
and $mon the month in the range 0..11, with 0 indicating
January and 11 indicating December. This makes it easy to
get a month name from a <br>
list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @abbr = qw( Jan Feb Mar Apr
May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec ); <br>
print &quot;$abbr[$mon] $mday&quot;; <br>
# $mon=9, $mday=18 gives &quot;Oct 18&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$year contains the number of
years since 1900. To get a 4-digit year write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$year += 1900;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get the last two digits of
the year (e.g., &quot;01&quot; in 2001) do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$year =
sprintf(&quot;%02d&quot;, $year % 100);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$wday is the day of the week,
with 0 indicating Sunday and 3 indicating Wednesday. $yday
is the day of the year, in the range 0..364 (or 0..365 in
leap years.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$isdst is true if the specified
time occurs during Daylight Saving Time, false
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EXPR is omitted,
&quot;localtime()&quot; uses the current time (as returned
by time(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In scalar context,
&quot;localtime()&quot; returns the ctime(3) value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$now_string = localtime; # e.g.,
&quot;Thu Oct 13 04:54:34 1994&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of this scalar value
is not locale-dependent but built into Perl. For GMT instead
of local time use the &quot;gmtime&quot; builtin. See also
the &quot;Time::Local&quot; module (for <br>
converting seconds, minutes, hours, and such back to the
integer value returned by time()), and the POSIX
module&rsquo;s strftime(3) and mktime(3) functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get somewhat similar but
locale-dependent date strings, set up your locale
environment variables appropriately (please see perllocale)
and try for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use POSIX qw(strftime); <br>
$now_string = strftime &quot;%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y&quot;,
localtime; <br>
# or for GMT formatted appropriately for your locale: <br>
$now_string = strftime &quot;%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y&quot;,
gmtime;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the %a and %b, the
short forms of the day of the week and the month of the
year, may not necessarily be three characters wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Time::gmtime and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log EXPR <br>
log Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of EXPR. If EXPR
is omitted, returns the log of $_. To get the log of another
base, use basic algebra: The base-N log of a number is <br>
equal to the natural log of that number divided by the
natural log of N. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub log10 { <br>

lstat <br>
Does the same thing as the &quot;stat&quot; function

stats a symbolic link instead of the file the symbolic link
points to. If <br>
symbolic links are unimplemented on your system, a normal

map EXPR,LIST <br>
Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for each element of LIST
(locally setting $_ to each element) and returns the list
value composed of the results of each such evaluation. In
<br>
scalar context, returns the total number of elements so
generated. Evaluates BLOCK or EXPR in list context, so each

realize something is wrong <br>
until it gets to the &quot;}&quot; and encounters the

mkdir FILENAME <br>
mkdir <br>
Creates the directory specified by FILENAME, with
permissions specified by MASK (as modified by

otherwise it returns false and sets <br>
$! (errno). MASK defaults to 0777 if omitted, and FILENAME
defaults to $_ if omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, it is better to
create directories with a permissive MASK and let the user
modify that with their &quot;umask&quot; than it is to
supply a restrictive MASK and give the <br>
user no way to be more permissive. The exceptions to this
rule are when the file or directory should be kept private
(mail files, for instance). The perlfunc(1) entry on <br>
&quot;umask&quot; discusses the choice of MASK in more
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that according to the POSIX

oct Interprets EXPR as an octal string and returns the

&quot;0x&quot;, interprets it as a hex string. If EXPR
starts off with <br>
&quot;0b&quot;, it is interpreted as a binary string.
Leading whitespace is ignored in all three cases.) The
following will handle decimal, binary, octal, and hex in
standard Perl <br>
notation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$val = oct($val) if $val =~

open FILEHANDLE,MODE,EXPR,LIST <br>
open FILEHANDLE,MODE,REFERENCE <br>
open FILEHANDLE <br>
Opens the file whose filename is given by EXPR, and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple examples to open a file
for reading:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;,

or die &quot;cannot open &gt; output.txt: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The following is a
comprehensive reference to open(): for a gentler
introduction you may consider perlopentut.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If FILEHANDLE is an undefined
scalar variable (or array or hash element), a new filehandle
is autovivified, meaning that the variable is assigned a
reference to a newly <br>
allocated anonymous filehandle. Otherwise if FILEHANDLE is
an expression, its value is the real filehandle. (This is
considered a symbolic reference, so &quot;use strict
&quot;refs&quot;&quot; <br>
should not be in effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EXPR is omitted, the global
(package) scalar variable of the same name as the FILEHANDLE
contains the filename. (Note that lexical variables--those
declared with &quot;my&quot; or <br>
&quot;state&quot;--will not work for this purpose; so if
you&rsquo;re using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;,
specify EXPR in your call to open.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If three (or more) arguments are
specified, the open mode (including optional encoding) in
the second argument are distinct from the filename in the
third. If MODE is &quot;&lt;&quot; or <br>
nothing, the file is opened for input. If MODE is
&quot;&gt;&quot;, the file is opened for output, with
existing files first being truncated (&quot;clobbered&quot;)
and nonexisting files newly <br>
created. If MODE is &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, the file is opened
for appending, again being created if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can put a &quot;+&quot; in
front of the &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; to
indicate that you want both read and write access to the
file; thus &quot;+&lt;&quot; is almost always preferred for
read/write <br>
updates--the &quot;+&gt;&quot; mode would clobber the file
first. You can&rsquo;t usually use either read-write mode
for updating textfiles, since they have variable-length
records. See the <br>
-i switch in perlrun for a better approach. The file is
created with permissions of 0666 modified by the
process&rsquo;s &quot;umask&quot; value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These various prefixes
correspond to the fopen(3) modes of &quot;r&quot;,
&quot;r+&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;,
&quot;a&quot;, and &quot;a+&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the one- and two-argument
forms of the call, the mode and filename should be
concatenated (in that order), preferably separated by white
space. You can--but <br>
shouldn&rsquo;t--omit the mode in these forms when that mode
is &quot;&lt;&quot;. It is always safe to use the
two-argument form of &quot;open&quot; if the filename
argument is a known literal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For three or more arguments if
MODE is &quot;|-&quot;, the filename is interpreted as a
command to which output is to be piped, and if MODE is
&quot;-|&quot;, the filename is interpreted as a <br>
command that pipes output to us. In the two-argument (and
one-argument) form, one should replace dash (&quot;-&quot;)
with the command. See &quot;Using open() for IPC&quot; in
perlipc for more <br>
examples of this. (You are not allowed to &quot;open&quot;
to a command that pipes both in and out, but see IPC::Open2,
IPC::Open3, and &quot;Bidirectional Communication with
Another <br>
Process&quot; in perlipc for alternatives.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the form of pipe opens taking
three or more arguments, if LIST is specified (extra
arguments after the command name) then LIST becomes
arguments to the command invoked if <br>
the platform supports it. The meaning of &quot;open&quot;
with more than three arguments for non-pipe modes is not yet
defined, but experimental &quot;layers&quot; may give extra
LIST arguments <br>
meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the two-argument (and
one-argument) form, opening &quot;&lt;-&quot; or
&quot;-&quot; opens STDIN and opening &quot;&gt;-&quot;
opens STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may (and usually should) use
the three-argument form of open to specify I/O layers
(sometimes referred to as &quot;disciplines&quot;) to apply
to the handle that affect how the <br>
input and output are processed (see open and PerlIO for more
details). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(my $fh,
&quot;&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;, &quot;filename&quot;) <br>
|| die &quot;can&rsquo;t open UTF-8 encoded filename:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opens the UTF8-encoded file
containing Unicode characters; see perluniintro. Note that
if layers are specified in the three-argument form, then
default layers stored in <br>
${^OPEN} (see perlvar; usually set by the open pragma or the
switch -CioD) are ignored. Those layers will also be ignored
if you specifying a colon with no name following <br>
it. In that case the default layer for the operating system
(:raw on Unix, :crlf on Windows) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open returns nonzero on success,
the undefined value otherwise. If the &quot;open&quot;
involved a pipe, the return value happens to be the pid of
the subprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re running Perl on
a system that distinguishes between text files and binary
files, then you should check out &quot;binmode&quot; for
tips for dealing with this. The key <br>
distinction between systems that need &quot;binmode&quot;
and those that don&rsquo;t is their text file formats.
Systems like Unix, Mac OS, and Plan 9, that end lines with a
single <br>
character and encode that character in C as &quot;0 do not
need &quot;binmode&quot;. The rest need it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When opening a file, it&rsquo;s
seldom a good idea to continue if the request failed, so
&quot;open&quot; is frequently used with &quot;die&quot;.
Even if &quot;die&quot; won&rsquo;t do what you want (say,
in a CGI <br>
script, where you want to format a suitable error message
(but there are modules that can help with that problem))
always check the return value from opening a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case the
three-argument form with a read/write mode and the third
argument being &quot;undef&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(my $tmp, &quot;+&gt;&quot;,
undef) or die ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opens a filehandle to an
anonymous temporary file. Also using &quot;+&lt;&quot; works
for symmetry, but you really should consider writing
something to the temporary file first. You <br>
will need to seek() to do the reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since v5.8.0, Perl has built
using PerlIO by default. Unless you&rsquo;ve changed this
(such as building Perl with &quot;Configure
-Uuseperlio&quot;), you can open filehandles directly to
<br>
Perl scalars via:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open($fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
ariable) || ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To (re)open &quot;STDOUT&quot;
or &quot;STDERR&quot; as an in-memory file, close it
first:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close STDOUT; <br>
open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;&quot;, ariable) <br>
or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open STDOUT: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General examples:</p>

$ARTICLE: $!0; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also, in the Bourne
shell tradition, specify an EXPR beginning with
&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;, in which case the rest of the string
is interpreted as the name of a filehandle (or file <br>
descriptor, if numeric) to be duped (as dup(2)) and opened.
You may use &quot;&amp;&quot; after &quot;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;+&gt;&quot;,
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;+&lt;&quot;. The mode you
specify should match the mode of the <br>
original filehandle. (Duping a filehandle does not take into
account any existing contents of IO buffers.) If you use the
three-argument form, then you can pass either a <br>
number, the name of a filehandle, or the normal
&quot;reference to a glob&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a script that saves,
redirects, and restores &quot;STDOUT&quot; and
&quot;STDERR&quot; using various methods:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
open(my $oldout, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;) or die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t dup STDOUT: $!&quot;; <br>
open(OLDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;, TDERR) or die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t dup STDERR: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(STDOUT, &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;,
&quot;foo.out&quot;) or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t redirect
STDOUT: $!&quot;; <br>
open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;) or die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t dup STDOUT: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select STDERR; $| = 1; # make
unbuffered <br>
select STDOUT; $| = 1; # make unbuffered</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print STDOUT &quot;stdout 10; #
this works for <br>
print STDERR &quot;stderr 10; # subprocesses too</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(STDOUT,
&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;, $oldout) or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t dup
ldout: $!&quot;; <br>
open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;OLDERR&quot;) or die

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print STDOUT &quot;stdout 20;
<br>
print STDERR &quot;stderr 20;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify
&rsquo;&lt;&amp;=X&rsquo;, where &quot;X&quot; is a file
descriptor number or a filehandle, then Perl will do an
equivalent of C&rsquo;s &quot;fdopen&quot; of that file
descriptor (and not call dup(2)); <br>
this is more parsimonious of file descriptors. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># open for input, reusing the
fileno of $fd <br>
open(FILEHANDLE, &quot;&lt;&amp;=$fd&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FILEHANDLE,
&quot;&lt;&amp;=&quot;, $fd)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># open for append, using the
fileno of OLDFH <br>
open(FH, &quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;=&quot;, OLDFH)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FH,
&quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;=OLDFH&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Being parsimonious on
filehandles is also useful (besides being parsimonious) for
example when something is dependent on file descriptors,
like for example locking using <br>
flock(). If you do just &quot;open(A,
&quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;B&quot;)&quot;, the filehandle A will not
have the same file descriptor as B, and therefore flock(A)
will not flock(B) nor vice versa. But with <br>
&quot;open(A, &quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;=B&quot;)&quot;, the
filehandles will share the same underlying system file
descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that under Perls older than
5.8.0, Perl uses the standard C library&rsquo;s&rsquo;
fdopen() to implement the &quot;=&quot; functionality. On
many Unix systems, fdopen() fails when file <br>
descriptors exceed a certain value, typically 255. For Perls
5.8.0 and later, PerlIO is (most often) the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can see whether your Perl
was built with PerlIO by running &quot;perl -V&quot; and
looking for the &quot;useperlio=&quot; line. If
&quot;useperlio&quot; is &quot;define&quot;, you have
PerlIO; otherwise you <br>
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you open a pipe on the
command &quot;-&quot; (that is, specify either
&quot;|-&quot; or &quot;-|&quot; with the one- or
two-argument forms of &quot;open&quot;), an implicit
&quot;fork&quot; is done, so &quot;open&quot; returns <br>
twice: in the parent process it returns the pid of the child
process, and in the child process it returns (a defined) 0.
Use &quot;defined($pid)&quot; or &quot;//&quot; to determine
whether the <br>
open was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, use either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$child_pid = open(FROM_KID,
&quot;-|&quot;) // die &quot;can&rsquo;t fork: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or <br>
$child_pid = open(TO_KID, &quot;|-&quot;) // die
&quot;can&rsquo;t fork: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">followed by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($child_pid) { <br>
# am the parent: <br>
# either write TO_KID or else read FROM_KID <br>
... <br>
wait $child_pid; <br>
} else { <br>
# am the child; use STDIN/STDOUT normally <br>
... <br>
exit; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filehandle behaves normally
for the parent, but I/O to that filehandle is piped from/to
the STDOUT/STDIN of the child process. In the child process,
the filehandle isn&rsquo;t <br>
opened--I/O happens from/to the new STDOUT/STDIN. Typically
this is used like the normal piped open when you want to
exercise more control over just how the pipe command <br>
gets executed, such as when running setuid and you
don&rsquo;t want to have to scan shell commands for
metacharacters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following blocks are more or
less equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO, &quot;|tr
&rsquo;[a-z]&rsquo; &rsquo;[A-Z]&rsquo;&quot;); <br>
open(FOO, &quot;|-&quot;, &quot;tr &rsquo;[a-z]&rsquo;
&rsquo;[A-Z]&rsquo;&quot;); <br>
open(FOO, &quot;|-&quot;) || exec &rsquo;tr&rsquo;,
&rsquo;[a-z]&rsquo;, &rsquo;[A-Z]&rsquo;; <br>
open(FOO, &quot;|-&quot;, &quot;tr&quot;,
&rsquo;[a-z]&rsquo;, &rsquo;[A-Z]&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO, &quot;cat -n
&rsquo;$file&rsquo;|&quot;); <br>
open(FOO, &quot;-|&quot;, &quot;cat -n
&rsquo;$file&rsquo;&quot;); <br>
open(FOO, &quot;-|&quot;) || exec &quot;cat&quot;,
&quot;-n&quot;, $file; <br>
open(FOO, &quot;-|&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;,
$file);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last two examples in each
block show the pipe as &quot;list form&quot;, which is not
yet supported on all platforms. A good rule of thumb is that
if your platform has a real <br>
&quot;fork()&quot; (in other words, if your platform is
Unix, including Linux and MacOS X), you can use the list
form. You would want to use the list form of the pipe so you
can pass <br>
literal arguments to the command without risk of the shell
interpreting any shell metacharacters in them. However, this
also bars you from opening pipes to commands that <br>
intentionally contain shell metacharacters, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO, &quot;|cat -n | expand
-4 | lpr&quot;) <br>
// die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open pipeline to lpr: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Safe Pipe Opens&quot;
in perlipc for more examples of this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl will
attempt to flush all files opened for output before any
operation that may do a fork, but this may not be supported
on some platforms (see <br>
perlport). To be safe, you may need to set $| ($AUTOFLUSH in
English) or call the &quot;autoflush()&quot; method of
&quot;IO::Handle&quot; on any open handles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support a
close-on-exec flag on files, the flag will be set for the
newly opened file descriptor as determined by the value of
$^F. See &quot;$^F&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closing any piped filehandle
causes the parent process to wait for the child to finish,
then returns the status value in $? and
&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename passed to the one-
and two-argument forms of open() will have leading and
trailing whitespace deleted and normal redirection
characters honored. This property, <br>
known as &quot;magic open&quot;, can often be used to good
effect. A user could specify a filename of &quot;rsh cat
file |&quot;, or you could change certain filenames as
needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$filename =~ s/(.*.gz)$/gzip -dc
&lt; $1|/; <br>
open(FH, $filename) or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open $filename:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the three-argument form to
open a file with arbitrary weird characters in it,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO, &quot;&lt;&quot;,
$file) <br>
|| die &quot;can&rsquo;t open &lt; $file: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise it&rsquo;s necessary
to protect any leading and trailing whitespace:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$file =~ s#^(#./$1#; <br>
open(FOO, &quot;&lt; $file &quot;) <br>
|| die &quot;open failed: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(this may not work on some
bizarre filesystems). One should conscientiously choose
between the magic and three-argument form of open():</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(IN, $ARGV[0]) || die
&quot;can&rsquo;t open $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will allow the user to specify
an argument of the form &quot;rsh cat file |&quot;, but will
not work on a filename that happens to have a trailing
space, while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(IN, &quot;&lt;&quot;,
$ARGV[0]) <br>
|| die &quot;can&rsquo;t open &lt; $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will have exactly the opposite
restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want a &quot;real&quot; C
&quot;open&quot; (see open(2) on your system), then you
should use the &quot;sysopen&quot; function, which involves
no such magic (but may use subtly different filemodes <br>
than Perl open(), which is mapped to C fopen()). This is
another way to protect your filenames from interpretation.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use IO::Handle; <br>
sysopen(HANDLE, $path, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL) <br>
or die &quot;sysopen $path: $!&quot;; <br>
$oldfh = select(HANDLE); $| = 1; select($oldfh); <br>
print HANDLE &quot;stuff $$0; <br>
seek(HANDLE, 0, 0); <br>
print &quot;File contains: &quot;, &lt;HANDLE&gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the constructor from the
&quot;IO::Handle&quot; package (or one of its subclasses,
such as &quot;IO::File&quot; or &quot;IO::Socket&quot;), you
can generate anonymous filehandles that have the scope <br>
of the variables used to hold them, then automatically (but
silently) close once their reference counts become zero,
typically at scope exit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use IO::File; <br>
#... <br>
sub read_myfile_munged { <br>
my $ALL = shift; <br>
# or just leave it undef to autoviv <br>
my $handle = IO::File-&gt;new; <br>
open($handle, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;myfile&quot;) or die
&quot;myfile: $!&quot;; <br>
$first = &lt;$handle&gt; <br>
or return (); # Automatically closed here. <br>
mung($first) or die &quot;mung failed&quot;; # Or here. <br>
return (first, &lt;$handle&gt;) if $ALL; # Or here. <br>
return $first; # Or here. <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: The previous example
has a bug because the automatic close that happens when the
refcount on &quot;handle&quot; does not properly detect and
report failures. Always close the <br>
handle yourself and inspect the return value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close($handle) <br>
|| warn &quot;close failed: $!&quot;;</p>

&quot;seekdir&quot;, &quot;rewinddir&quot;, and
&quot;closedir&quot;. Returns true if successful. DIRHANDLE
may be an expression <br>

the real dirhandle name. If DIRHANDLE is an undefined scalar
variable (or array or hash element), the variable is <br>
assigned a reference to a new anonymous dirhandle; that is,
it&rsquo;s autovivified. DIRHANDLEs have their own namespace
separate from FILEHANDLEs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the example at

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ord EXPR <br>
ord Returns the numeric value of the first character of

&quot;our&quot; associates a simple name with a package
variable in the current package for use within the current
scope. When &quot;use strict &rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot; is in
effect, &quot;our&quot; lets you use <br>
declared global variables without qualifying them with
package names, within the lexical scope of the
&quot;our&quot; declaration. In this way &quot;our&quot;
differs from &quot;use vars&quot;, which is <br>
package-scoped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;state&quot;, which allocates storage for a variable
and associates a simple name with that storage for use
within the current scope, &quot;our&quot; associates a
simple name <br>
with a package (read: global) variable in the current
package, for use within the current lexical scope. In other
words, &quot;our&quot; has the same scoping rules as
&quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;, <br>
but does not necessarily create a variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one value is
listed, the list must be placed in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">our $foo; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;our&quot; declaration
declares a global variable that will be visible across its
entire lexical scope, even across package boundaries. The
package in which the variable is <br>
entered is determined at the point of the declaration, not
at the point of use. This means the following behavior
holds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Foo; <br>
our $bar; # declares $Foo::bar for rest of lexical scope
<br>
$bar = 20;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Bar; <br>
print $bar; # prints 20, as it refers to $Foo::bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple &quot;our&quot;
declarations with the same name in the same lexical scope
are allowed if they are in different packages. If they
happen to be in the same package, Perl will <br>
emit warnings if you have asked for them, just like multiple
&quot;my&quot; declarations. Unlike a second &quot;my&quot;
declaration, which will bind the name to a fresh variable, a
second <br>
&quot;our&quot; declaration in the same package, in the same
scope, is merely redundant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use warnings; <br>
package Foo; <br>
our $bar; # declares $Foo::bar for rest of lexical scope
<br>
$bar = 20;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Bar; <br>
our $bar = 30; # declares $Bar::bar for rest of lexical
scope <br>
print $bar; # prints 30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">our $bar; # emits warning but
has no other effect <br>
print $bar; # still prints 30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;our&quot; declaration
may also have a list of attributes associated with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact semantics and
interface of TYPE and ATTRS are still evolving. TYPE is
currently bound to the use of the &quot;fields&quot; pragma,
and attributes are handled using the <br>
&quot;attributes&quot; pragma, or, starting from Perl 5.8.0,
also via the &quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot; module. See
&quot;Private Variables via my()&quot; in perlsub for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack TEMPLATE,LIST <br>
Takes a LIST of values and converts it into a string using
the rules given by the TEMPLATE. The resulting string is the
concatenation of the converted values. Typically, <br>
each converted value looks like its machine-level
representation. For example, on 32-bit machines an integer
may be represented by a sequence of 4 bytes, which will in
Perl <br>
be presented as a string that&rsquo;s 4 characters long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlpacktut for an
introduction to this function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TEMPLATE is a sequence of
characters that give the order and type of values, as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a A string with arbitrary binary

A A text (ASCII) string, will be space padded. <br>
Z A null-terminated (ASCIZ) string, will be null padded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b A bit string (ascending bit
order inside each byte, <br>
like vec()). <br>

<br>
Q An unsigned quad value. <br>
(Quads are available only if your system supports 64-bit
<br>
integer values _and_ if Perl has been compiled to support
<br>
those. Raises an exception otherwise.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i A signed integer value. <br>
I A unsigned integer value. <br>
(This &rsquo;integer&rsquo; is _at_least_ 32 bits wide. Its
exact <br>

&rsquo;int&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n An unsigned short (16-bit) in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j A Perl internal signed integer

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p A pointer to a null-terminated

P A pointer to a structure (fixed-length string).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u A uuencoded string. <br>
U A Unicode character number. Encodes to a character in
char- <br>
acter mode and UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC in EBCDIC platforms) in
<br>
byte mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w A BER compressed integer (not
an ASN.1 BER, see perlpacktut <br>
for details). Its bytes represent an unsigned integer in
<br>
base 128, most significant digit first, with as few digits
<br>
as possible. Bit eight (the high bit) is set on each byte
<br>
except the last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x A null byte (a.k.a ASCII NUL,

second column lists letters for which the modifier is
valid):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! sSlLiI Forces native (short,
long, int) sizes instead <br>
of fixed (16-/32-bit) sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xX Make x and X act as alignment

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nNvV Treat integers as signed
instead of unsigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@. Specify position as byte

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; sSiIlLqQ Force big-endian
byte-order on the type. <br>
jJfFdDpP (The &quot;big end&quot; touches the
construct.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; sSiIlLqQ Force
little-endian byte-order on the type. <br>
jJfFdDpP (The &quot;little end&quot; touches the
construct.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;&gt;&quot; and
&quot;&lt;&quot; modifiers can also be used on
&quot;()&quot; groups to force a particular byte-order on
all components in that group, including all its
subgroups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following rules apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each letter may
optionally be followed by a number indicating the repeat
count. A numeric repeat count may optionally be enclosed in
brackets, as in &quot;pack(&quot;C[80]&quot;, <br>
@arr)&quot;. The repeat count gobbles that many values from
the LIST when used with all format types other than
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,
&quot;B&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;@&quot;,
&quot;.&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and <br>
&quot;P&quot;, where it means something else, described
below. Supplying a &quot;*&quot; for the repeat count
instead of a number means to use however many items are
left, except for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;@&quot;,
&quot;x&quot;, and &quot;X&quot;, where it is equivalent to
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &lt;.&gt;, where
it means relative to the start of the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;u&quot;,
where it is equivalent to 1 (or 45, which here is
equivalent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can replace a numeric repeat
count with a template letter enclosed in brackets to use the
packed byte length of the bracketed template for the repeat
count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the template
&quot;x[L]&quot; skips as many bytes as in a packed long,
and the template &quot;$t X[$t] $t&quot; unpacks twice
whatever $t (when variable-expanded) unpacks. If <br>
the template in brackets contains alignment commands (such
as &quot;x![d]&quot;), its packed length is calculated as if
the start of the template had the maximal possible <br>
alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with &quot;Z&quot;, a
&quot;*&quot; as the repeat count is guaranteed to add a
trailing null byte, so the resulting string is always one
byte longer than the byte length of the <br>
item itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with &quot;@&quot;,
the repeat count represents an offset from the start of the
innermost &quot;()&quot; group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with &quot;.&quot;,
the repeat count determines the starting position to
calculate the value offset as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the repeat
count is 0, it&rsquo;s relative to the current position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the repeat
count is &quot;*&quot;, the offset is relative to the start
of the packed string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; And if
it&rsquo;s an integer n, the offset is relative to the start
of the nth innermost &quot;( )&quot; group, or to the start
of the string if n is bigger then the group level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The repeat count for
&quot;u&quot; is interpreted as the maximal number of bytes
to encode per line of output, with 0, 1 and 2 replaced by
45. The repeat count should not be more <br>
than 65.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; types gobble
just one value, but pack it as a string of length count,
padding with nulls or spaces as needed. When unpacking,
&quot;A&quot; strips trailing <br>
whitespace and nulls, &quot;Z&quot; strips everything after
the first null, and &quot;a&quot; returns data with no
stripping at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value to pack is too
long, the result is truncated. If it&rsquo;s too long and an
explicit count is provided, &quot;Z&quot; packs only
&quot;$count-1&quot; bytes, followed by a null byte. <br>
Thus &quot;Z&quot; always packs a trailing null, except when
the count is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Likewise, the
&quot;b&quot; and &quot;B&quot; formats pack a string
that&rsquo;s that many bits long. Each such format generates
1 bit of the result. These are typically followed by a
repeat <br>
count like &quot;B8&quot; or &quot;B64&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each result bit is based on the
least-significant bit of the corresponding input character,
i.e., on &quot;ord($char)%2&quot;. In particular, characters
&quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; generate bits <br>
0 and 1, as do characters &quot; 00&quot; and &quot;
01&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting from the beginning of
the input string, each 8-tuple of characters is converted to
1 character of output. With format &quot;b&quot;, the first
character of the 8-tuple <br>
determines the least-significant bit of a character; with
format &quot;B&quot;, it determines the most-significant bit
of a character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the length of the input
string is not evenly divisible by 8, the remainder is packed
as if the input string were padded by null characters at the
end. Similarly <br>
during unpacking, &quot;extra&quot; bits are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input string is longer
than needed, remaining characters are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;*&quot; for the repeat
count uses all characters of the input field. On unpacking,
bits are converted to a string of 0s and 1s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;h&quot; and &quot;H&quot; formats pack a string that
many nybbles (4-bit groups, representable as hexadecimal
digits, &quot;0&quot;..&quot;9&quot;
&quot;a&quot;..&quot;f&quot;) long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each such format, pack()
generates 4 bits of result. With non-alphabetical
characters, the result is based on the 4 least-significant
bits of the input character, <br>
i.e., on &quot;ord($char)%16&quot;. In particular,
characters &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; generate nybbles
0 and 1, as do bytes &quot; 00&quot; and &quot; 01&quot;.
For characters &quot;a&quot;..&quot;f&quot; and
&quot;A&quot;..&quot;F&quot;, the <br>
result is compatible with the usual hexadecimal digits, so
that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; both generate the
nybble &quot;0xA==10&quot;. Use only these specific hex
characters with this format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting from the beginning of
the template to pack(), each pair of characters is converted
to 1 character of output. With format &quot;h&quot;, the
first character of the pair <br>
determines the least-significant nybble of the output
character; with format &quot;H&quot;, it determines the
most-significant nybble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the length of the input
string is not even, it behaves as if padded by a null
character at the end. Similarly, &quot;extra&quot; nybbles
are ignored during unpacking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input string is longer
than needed, extra characters are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;*&quot; for the repeat
count uses all characters of the input field. For unpack(),
nybbles are converted to a string of hexadecimal digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;p&quot; format packs a pointer to a null-terminated
string. You are responsible for ensuring that the string is
not a temporary value, as that could potentially get <br>
deallocated before you got around to using the packed
result. The &quot;P&quot; format packs a pointer to a
structure of the size indicated by the length. A null
pointer is <br>
created if the corresponding value for &quot;p&quot; or
&quot;P&quot; is &quot;undef&quot;; similarly with unpack(),
where a null pointer unpacks into &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system has a strange
pointer size--meaning a pointer is neither as big as an int
nor as big as a long--it may not be possible to pack or
unpack pointers in big- <br>
or little-endian byte order. Attempting to do so raises an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;/&quot; template character allows packing and
unpacking of a sequence of items where the packed structure
contains a packed item count followed by the packed items
<br>
themselves. This is useful when the structure you&rsquo;re
unpacking has encoded the sizes or repeat counts for some of
its fields within the structure itself as separate <br>
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For &quot;pack&quot;, you write
length-item&quot;/&quot;sequence-item, and the length-item
describes how the length value is packed. Formats likely to
be of most use are integer-packing <br>
ones like &quot;n&quot; for Java strings, &quot;w&quot; for
ASN.1 or SNMP, and &quot;N&quot; for Sun XDR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For &quot;pack&quot;,
sequence-item may have a repeat count, in which case the
minimum of that and the number of available items is used as
the argument for length-item. If it has <br>
no repeat count or uses a &rsquo;*&rsquo;, the number of
available items is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For &quot;unpack&quot;, an
internal stack of integer arguments unpacked so far is used.
You write &quot;/&quot;sequence-item and the repeat count is
obtained by popping off the last element <br>
from the stack. The sequence-item must not have a repeat
count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sequence-item refers to a
string type (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, or
&quot;Z&quot;), the length-item is the string length, not
the number of strings. With an explicit repeat count for
pack, the <br>
packed string is adjusted to that length. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This code: gives this
result:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unpack(&quot;W/a&quot;, &quot;
04Gurusamy&quot;) (&quot;Guru&quot;) <br>
unpack(&quot;a3/A A*&quot;, &quot;007 Bond J &quot;) (&quot;
Bond&quot;, &quot;J&quot;) <br>
unpack(&quot;a3 x2 /A A*&quot;, &quot;007: Bond, J.&quot;)
(&quot;Bond, J&quot;, &quot;.&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack(&quot;n/a*
w/a&quot;,&quot;hello,&quot;,&quot;world&quot;) &quot; 00
06hello, 05world&quot; <br>
pack(&quot;a/W2&quot;, ord(&quot;a&quot;) ..
ord(&quot;z&quot;)) &quot;2ab&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The length-item is not returned
explicitly from &quot;unpack&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supplying a count to the
length-item format letter is only useful with &quot;A&quot;,
&quot;a&quot;, or &quot;Z&quot;. Packing with a length-item
of &quot;a&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; may introduce &quot;
00&quot; characters, which <br>
Perl does not regard as legal in numeric strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The integer
types &quot;s&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, and
&quot;L&quot; may be followed by a &quot;!&quot; modifier to
specify native shorts or longs. As shown in the example
above, a bare &quot;l&quot; means exactly 32 <br>
bits, although the native &quot;long&quot; as seen by the
local C compiler may be larger. This is mainly an issue on
64-bit platforms. You can see whether using &quot;!&quot;
makes any <br>
difference this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;format s is %d, s!
is %d0, <br>
length pack(&quot;s&quot;), length pack(&quot;s!&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;format l is %d, l!
is %d0, <br>
length pack(&quot;l&quot;), length pack(&quot;l!&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;i!&quot; and
&quot;I!&quot; are also allowed, but only for
completeness&rsquo; sake: they are identical to
&quot;i&quot; and &quot;I&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual sizes (in bytes) of
native shorts, ints, longs, and long longs on the platform
where Perl was built are also available from the command
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl
-V:{short,int,long{,long}}size <br>
shortsize=&rsquo;2&rsquo;; <br>
intsize=&rsquo;4&rsquo;; <br>
longsize=&rsquo;4&rsquo;; <br>
longlongsize=&rsquo;8&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or programmatically via the
&quot;Config&quot; module:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
print $Config{shortsize}, &quot;0; <br>
print $Config{intsize}, &quot;0; <br>
print $Config{longsize}, &quot;0; <br>
print $Config{longlongsize}, &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Config{longlongsize} is
undefined on systems without long long support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The integer
formats &quot;s&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;i&quot;,
&quot;I&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;j&quot;,
and &quot;J&quot; are inherently non-portable between
processors and operating systems because they obey native
byteorder and <br>
endianness. For example, a 4-byte integer 0x12345678
(305419896 decimal) would be ordered natively (arranged in
and handled by the CPU registers) into bytes as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 # big-endian
<br>
0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 # little-endian</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basically, Intel and VAX CPUs
are little-endian, while everybody else, including Motorola
m68k/88k, PPC, Sparc, HP PA, Power, and Cray, are
big-endian. Alpha and MIPS <br>
can be either: Digital/Compaq uses (well, used) them in
little-endian mode, but SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names big-endian and
little-endian are comic references to the egg-eating habits
of the little-endian Lilliputians and the big-endian
Blefuscudians from the classic <br>
Jonathan Swift satire, Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels. This
entered computer lingo via the paper &quot;On Holy Wars and
a Plea for Peace&quot; by Danny Cohen, USC/ISI IEN 137,
April 1, 1980.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some systems may have even
weirder byte orders such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x56 0x78 0x12 0x34 <br>
0x34 0x12 0x78 0x56</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can determine your system
endianness with this incantation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf(&quot;%#02x &quot;, $_)
for unpack(&quot;W*&quot;, pack L=&gt;0x12345678);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The byteorder on the platform
where Perl was built is also available via Config:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
print &quot;$Config{byteorder}0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or from the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -V:byteorder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Byteorders &quot;1234&quot; and
&quot;12345678&quot; are little-endian; &quot;4321&quot; and
&quot;87654321&quot; are big-endian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For portably packed integers,
either use the formats &quot;n&quot;, &quot;N&quot;,
&quot;v&quot;, and &quot;V&quot; or else use the
&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; modifiers described
immediately below. See also perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Starting with
Perl 5.9.2, integer and floating-point formats, along with
the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;P&quot; formats and
&quot;()&quot; groups, may all be followed by the
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; endianness <br>
modifiers to respectively enforce big- or little-endian
byte-order. These modifiers are especially useful given how
&quot;n&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and
&quot;V&quot; don&rsquo;t cover signed integers, <br>
64-bit integers, or floating-point values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some concerns to keep
in mind when using an endianness modifier:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Exchanging
signed integers between different platforms works only when
all platforms store them in the same format. Most platforms
store signed integers in two&rsquo;s- <br>
complement notation, so usually this is not an issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; modifiers can only be
used on floating-point formats on big- or little-endian
machines. Otherwise, attempting to use them raises an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Forcing big- or
little-endian byte-order on floating-point values for data
exchange can work only if all platforms use the same binary
representation such as IEEE <br>
floating-point. Even if all platforms are using IEEE, there
may still be subtle differences. Being able to use
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; on floating-point
values can be useful, <br>
but also dangerous if you don&rsquo;t know exactly what
you&rsquo;re doing. It is not a general way to portably
store floating-point values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When using
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; on a &quot;()&quot;
group, this affects all types inside the group that accept
byte-order modifiers, including all subgroups. It is
silently ignored for <br>
all other types. You are not allowed to override the
byte-order within a group that already has a byte-order
modifier suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Real numbers
(floats and doubles) are in native machine format only. Due
to the multiplicity of floating-point formats and the lack
of a standard &quot;network&quot; <br>
representation for them, no facility for interchange has
been made. This means that packed floating-point data
written on one machine may not be readable on another, <br>
even if both use IEEE floating-point arithmetic (because the
endianness of the memory representation is not part of the
IEEE spec). See also perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you know exactly what
you&rsquo;re doing, you can use the &quot;&gt;&quot; or
&quot;&lt;&quot; modifiers to force big- or little-endian
byte-order on floating-point values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because Perl uses doubles (or
long doubles, if configured) internally for all numeric
calculation, converting from double into float and thence to
double again loses <br>
precision, so &quot;unpack(&quot;f&quot;,
pack(&quot;f&quot;, $foo)&quot;) will not in general equal
$foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pack and unpack
can operate in two modes: character mode (&quot;C0&quot;
mode) where the packed string is processed per character,
and UTF-8 mode (&quot;U0&quot; mode) where the packed <br>
string is processed in its UTF-8-encoded Unicode form on a
byte-by-byte basis. Character mode is the default unless the
format string starts with &quot;U&quot;. You can always <br>
switch mode mid-format with an explicit &quot;C0&quot; or
&quot;U0&quot; in the format. This mode remains in effect
until the next mode change, or until the end of the
&quot;()&quot; group it <br>
(directly) applies to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;C0&quot; to get
Unicode characters while using &quot;U0&quot; to get
non-Unicode bytes is not necessarily obvious. Probably only
the first of these is what you want:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -CS -E &rsquo;say
&quot;1}9}&quot;&rsquo; | <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those examples also illustrate
that you should not try to use
&quot;pack&quot;/&quot;unpack&quot; as a substitute for the
Encode module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You must
yourself do any alignment or padding by inserting, for
example, enough &quot;x&quot;es while packing. There is no
way for pack() and unpack() to know where characters are
<br>
going to or coming from, so they handle their output and
input as flat sequences of characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A &quot;()&quot;
group is a sub-TEMPLATE enclosed in parentheses. A group may
take a repeat count either as postfix, or for unpack(), also
via the &quot;/&quot; template character. Within <br>
each repetition of a group, positioning with &quot;@&quot;
starts over at 0. Therefore, the result of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack(&quot;@1A((@2A)@3A)&quot;,
qw[X Y Z])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the string &quot; X
YZ&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;x&quot;
and &quot;X&quot; accept the &quot;!&quot; modifier to act
as alignment commands: they jump forward or back to the
closest position aligned at a multiple of &quot;count&quot;
characters. For <br>
example, to pack() or unpack() a C structure like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct { <br>
char c; /* one signed, 8-bit character */ <br>
double d; <br>
char cc[2]; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one may need to use the template
&quot;c x![d] d c[2]&quot;. This assumes that doubles must
be aligned to the size of double.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For alignment commands, a
&quot;count&quot; of 0 is equivalent to a &quot;count&quot;
of 1; both are no-ops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;n&quot;,
&quot;N&quot;, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;V&quot; accept the
&quot;!&quot; modifier to represent signed 16-/32-bit
integers in big-/little-endian order. This is portable only
when all platforms sharing <br>
packed data use the same binary representation for signed
integers; for example, when all platforms use
two&rsquo;s-complement representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Comments can be
embedded in a TEMPLATE using &quot;#&quot; through the end
of line. White space can separate pack codes from each
other, but modifiers and repeat counts must <br>
follow immediately. Breaking complex templates into
individual line-by-line components, suitably annotated, can
do as much to improve legibility and maintainability of <br>
pack/unpack formats as &quot;/x&quot; can for complicated
pattern matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If TEMPLATE
requires more arguments than pack() is given, pack() assumes
additional &quot;&quot; arguments. If TEMPLATE requires
fewer arguments than given, extra arguments are <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package NAMESPACE <br>
package NAMESPACE VERSION <br>
package NAMESPACE BLOCK <br>
package NAMESPACE VERSION BLOCK <br>
Declares the BLOCK or the rest of the compilation unit as
being in the given namespace. The scope of the package
declaration is either the supplied code BLOCK or, in the
<br>
absence of a BLOCK, from the declaration itself through the
end of current scope (the enclosing block, file, or
&quot;eval&quot;). That is, the forms without a BLOCK are
operative <br>
through the end of the current scope, just like the
&quot;my&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, and &quot;our&quot;
operators. All unqualified dynamic identifiers in this scope
will be in the given namespace, <br>
except where overridden by another &quot;package&quot;
declaration or when they&rsquo;re one of the special
identifiers that qualify into &quot;main::&quot;, like
&quot;STDOUT&quot;, &quot;ARGV&quot;, &quot;ENV&quot;, and
the <br>
punctuation variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A package statement affects
dynamic variables only, including those you&rsquo;ve used
&quot;local&quot; on, but not lexical variables, which are
created with &quot;my&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, or
&quot;our&quot;. <br>
Typically it would be the first declaration in a file
included by &quot;require&quot; or &quot;use&quot;. You can
switch into a package in more than one place, since this
only determines which <br>
default symbol table the compiler uses for the rest of that
block. You can refer to identifiers in other packages than
the current one by prefixing the identifier with the <br>
package name and a double colon, as in $SomePack::var or
&quot;ThatPack::INPUT_HANDLE&quot;. If package name is
omitted, the &quot;main&quot; package as assumed. That is,
$::sail is equivalent <br>
to $main::sail (as well as to &quot;$main&rsquo;sail&quot;,
still seen in ancient code, mostly from Perl 4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If VERSION is provided,
&quot;package&quot; sets the $VERSION variable in the given
namespace to a version object with the VERSION provided.
VERSION must be a &quot;strict&quot; style version <br>
number as defined by the version module: a positive decimal
number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation
or else a dotted-decimal v-string with a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; <br>
character and at least three components. You should set
$VERSION only once per package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Packages&quot; in
perlmod for more information about packages, modules, and
classes. See perlsub for other scoping issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__PACKAGE__ <br>
A special token that returns the name of the package in
which it occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe READHANDLE,WRITEHANDLE <br>
Opens a pair of connected pipes like the corresponding
system call. Note that if you set up a loop of piped
processes, deadlock can occur unless you are very careful.
In <br>
addition, note that Perl&rsquo;s pipes use IO buffering, so
you may need to set $| to flush your WRITEHANDLE after each
command, depending on the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3, and
&quot;Bidirectional Communication with Another Process&quot;
in perlipc for examples of such things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support a
close-on-exec flag on files, that flag is set on all newly
opened file descriptors whose &quot;fileno&quot;s are higher
than the current value of $^F (by <br>
default 2 for &quot;STDERR&quot;). See &quot;$^F&quot; in
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pop ARRAY <br>
pop EXPR <br>
pop Pops and returns the last value of the array, shortening
the array by one element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns the undefined value if
the array is empty, although this may also happen at other
times. If ARRAY is omitted, pops the @ARGV array in the main
program, but the @_ <br>
array in subroutines, just like &quot;shift&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,
&quot;pop&quot; can take a scalar EXPR, which must hold a
reference to an unblessed array. The argument will be
dereferenced automatically. This aspect of <br>
&quot;pop&quot; is considered highly experimental. The exact
behaviour may change in a future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be
users of your code who are running earlier versions of Perl
with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of thing at the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.014; # so push/pop/etc
work on scalars (experimental)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pos SCALAR <br>
pos Returns the offset of where the last &quot;m//g&quot;
search left off for the variable in question ($_ is used
when the variable is not specified). Note that 0 is a valid
match <br>
offset. &quot;undef&quot; indicates that the search position
is reset (usually due to match failure, but can also be
because no match has yet been run on the scalar).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;pos&quot; directly
accesses the location used by the regexp engine to store the
offset, so assigning to &quot;pos&quot; will change that
offset, and so will also influence the &quot;G&quot; zero-
<br>
width assertion in regular expressions. Both of these
effects take place for the next match, so you can&rsquo;t
affect the position with &quot;pos&quot; during the current
match, such as in <br>
&quot;(?{pos() = 5})&quot; or &quot;s//pos() =
5/e&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting &quot;pos&quot; also
resets the matched with zero-length flag, described under
&quot;Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length
Substring&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because a failed
&quot;m//gc&quot; match doesn&rsquo;t reset the offset, the
return from &quot;pos&quot; won&rsquo;t change either in
this case. See perlre and perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print FILEHANDLE LIST <br>
print FILEHANDLE <br>
print LIST <br>
print <br>
Prints a string or a list of strings. Returns true if
successful. FILEHANDLE may be a scalar variable containing
the name of or a reference to the filehandle, thus <br>
introducing one level of indirection. (NOTE: If FILEHANDLE
is a variable and the next token is a term, it may be
misinterpreted as an operator unless you interpose a
&quot;+&quot; or <br>
put parentheses around the arguments.) If FILEHANDLE is
omitted, prints to the last selected (see
&quot;select&quot;) output handle. If LIST is omitted,
prints $_ to the currently <br>
selected output handle. To use FILEHANDLE alone to print the
content of $_ to it, you must use a real filehandle like
&quot;FH&quot;, not an indirect one like $fh. To set the
default <br>
output handle to something other than STDOUT, use the select
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current value of $, (if any)
is printed between each LIST item. The current value of
&quot;$ <br>
takes a LIST, anything in the LIST is evaluated in list
context, including any subroutines whose return lists you
pass to &quot;print&quot;. Be careful not to follow the
print keyword <br>
with a left parenthesis unless you want the corresponding
right parenthesis to terminate the arguments to the print;
put parentheses around all arguments (or interpose a
&quot;+&quot;, <br>
but that doesn&rsquo;t look as good).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re storing handles
in an array or hash, or in general whenever you&rsquo;re
using any expression more complex than a bareword handle or
a plain, unsubscripted scalar <br>
variable to retrieve it, you will have to use a block
returning the filehandle value instead, in which case the
LIST may not be omitted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print { $files[$i] }
&quot;stuff0; <br>
print { $OK ? STDOUT : STDERR } &quot;stuff0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing to a closed pipe or
socket will generate a SIGPIPE signal. See perlipc for more
on signal handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf FILEHANDLE FORMAT, LIST
<br>
printf FILEHANDLE <br>
printf FORMAT, LIST <br>
printf <br>
Equivalent to &quot;print FILEHANDLE sprintf(FORMAT,
LIST)&quot;, except that &quot;$ <br>
the &quot;printf&quot; format. See sprintf for an
explanation of the format argument. If you omit the LIST, $_
is used; to use FILEHANDLE without a LIST, you must use a
real <br>
filehandle like &quot;FH&quot;, not an indirect one like
$fh. If &quot;use locale&quot; (including &quot;use locale
&rsquo;:not_characters&rsquo;&quot;) is in effect and
POSIX::setlocale() has been called, the <br>
character used for the decimal separator in formatted
floating-point numbers is affected by the LC_NUMERIC locale
setting. See perllocale and POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap
of using a &quot;printf&quot; when a simple
&quot;print&quot; would do. The &quot;print&quot; is more
efficient and less error prone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prototype FUNCTION <br>
Returns the prototype of a function as a string (or
&quot;undef&quot; if the function has no prototype).
FUNCTION is a reference to, or the name of, the function
whose prototype you <br>
want to retrieve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If FUNCTION is a string starting
with &quot;CORE::&quot;, the rest is taken as a name for a
Perl builtin. If the builtin is not overridable (such as
&quot;qw//&quot;) or if its arguments cannot <br>
be adequately expressed by a prototype (such as
&quot;system&quot;), prototype() returns &quot;undef&quot;,
because the builtin does not really behave like a Perl
function. Otherwise, the <br>
string describing the equivalent prototype is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push ARRAY,LIST <br>
push EXPR,LIST <br>
Treats ARRAY as a stack by appending the values of LIST to
the end of ARRAY. The length of ARRAY increases by the
length of LIST. Has the same effect as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for $value (LIST) { <br>
$ARRAY[++$#ARRAY] = $value; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but is more efficient. Returns
the number of elements in the array following the completed
&quot;push&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,
&quot;push&quot; can take a scalar EXPR, which must hold a

Returns the value of EXPR with all the ASCII

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl v5.14, all non-ASCII
characters are quoted in non-UTF-8-encoded strings, but not
quoted in UTF-8 strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting in Perl v5.16, Perl
adopted a Unicode-defined strategy for quoting non-ASCII
characters; the quoting of ASCII characters is
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also unchanged is the quoting of
non-UTF-8 strings when outside the scope of a &quot;use
feature &rsquo;unicode_strings&rsquo;&quot;, which is to
quote all characters in the upper Latin1 range. <br>
This provides complete backwards compatibility for old
programs which do not use Unicode. (Note that
&quot;unicode_strings&quot; is automatically enabled within
the scope of a <br>
&quot;use v5.12&quot; or greater.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the scope of &quot;use
locale&quot;, all non-ASCII Latin1 code points are quoted
whether the string is encoded as UTF-8 or not. As mentioned
above, locale does not affect the <br>
quoting of ASCII-range characters. This protects against
those locales where characters such as &quot;|&quot; are
considered to be word characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, Perl quotes non-ASCII
characters using an adaptation from Unicode (see
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/&gt;.) The only code
points that are quoted are those <br>
that have any of the Unicode properties: Pattern_Syntax,
Pattern_White_Space, White_Space,
Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, or
General_Category=Control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of these properties, the two
important ones are Pattern_Syntax and Pattern_White_Space.
They have been set up by Unicode for exactly this purpose of
deciding which <br>
characters in a regular expression pattern should be quoted.
No character that can be in an identifier has these
properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl promises, that if we ever
add regular expression pattern metacharacters to the dozen
already defined (&quot;&nbsp;| ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ? .&quot;),
that we will only use ones that have <br>
the Pattern_Syntax property. Perl also promises, that if we
ever add characters that are considered to be white space in
regular expressions (currently mostly affected by <br>
&quot;/x&quot;), they will all have the Pattern_White_Space
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode promises that the set of
code points that have these two properties will never
change, so something that is not quoted in v5.16 will never
need to be quoted in any <br>
future Perl release. (Not all the code points that match
Pattern_Syntax have actually had characters assigned to
them; so there is room to grow, but they are quoted whether
<br>
assigned or not. Perl, of course, would never use an
unassigned code point as an actual metacharacter.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoting characters that have the
other 3 properties is done to enhance the readability of the
regular expression and not because they actually need to be
quoted for regular <br>
expression purposes (characters with the White_Space
property are likely to be indistinguishable on the page or
screen from those with the Pattern_White_Space property; and
<br>
the other two properties contain non-printing
characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand EXPR <br>
rand <br>
Returns a random fractional number greater than or equal to
0 and less than the value of EXPR. (EXPR should be
positive.) If EXPR is omitted, the value 1 is used. <br>
Currently EXPR with the value 0 is also special-cased as 1
(this was undocumented before Perl 5.8.0 and is subject to
change in future versions of Perl). Automatically calls <br>
&quot;srand&quot; unless &quot;srand&quot; has already been
called. See also &quot;srand&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apply &quot;int()&quot; to the
value returned by &quot;rand()&quot; if you want random
integers instead of random fractional numbers. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int(rand(10))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">returns a random integer between
0 and 9, inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note: If your rand function
consistently returns numbers that are too large or too
small, then your version of Perl was probably compiled with
the wrong number of RANDBITS.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;rand()&quot; is not
cryptographically secure. You should not rely on it in
security-sensitive situations. As of this writing, a number
of third-party CPAN modules offer random <br>
number generators intended by their authors to be
cryptographically secure, including: Data::Entropy,
Crypt::Random, Math::Random::Secure, and
Math::TrulyRandom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read
FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET <br>
read FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH <br>
Attempts to read LENGTH characters of data into variable
SCALAR from the specified FILEHANDLE. Returns the number of
characters actually read, 0 at end of file, or undef if <br>
there was an error (in the latter case $! is also set).
SCALAR will be grown or shrunk so that the last character
actually read is the last character of the scalar after the
<br>
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An OFFSET may be specified to
place the read data at some place in the string other than
the beginning. A negative OFFSET specifies placement at that
many characters <br>
counting backwards from the end of the string. A positive
OFFSET greater than the length of SCALAR results in the
string being padded to the required size with &quot; &quot;
bytes <br>
before the result of the read is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The call is implemented in terms
of either Perl&rsquo;s or your system&rsquo;s native
fread(3) library function. To get a true read(2) system
call, see sysread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the characters: depending
on the status of the filehandle, either (8-bit) bytes or
characters are read. By default, all filehandles operate on
bytes, but for example if <br>
the filehandle has been opened with the &quot;:utf8&quot;
I/O layer (see &quot;open&quot;, and the &quot;open&quot;
pragma, open), the I/O will operate on UTF8-encoded Unicode
characters, not bytes. <br>
Similarly for the &quot;:encoding&quot; pragma: in that case
pretty much any characters can be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdir DIRHANDLE <br>
Returns the next directory entry for a directory opened by
&quot;opendir&quot;. If used in list context, returns all
the rest of the entries in the directory. If there are no
more <br>
entries, returns the undefined value in scalar context and
the empty list in list context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re planning to
filetest the return values out of a &quot;readdir&quot;,
you&rsquo;d better prepend the directory in question.
Otherwise, because we didn&rsquo;t &quot;chdir&quot; there,
it would <br>
have been testing the wrong file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opendir(my $dh, $some_dir) ||

@dots = grep { /^./ &amp;&amp; -f &quot;$some_dir/$_&quot; }
readdir($dh); <br>
closedir $dh;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of Perl 5.11.2 you can use a
bare &quot;readdir&quot; in a &quot;while&quot; loop, which
will set $_ on every iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opendir(my $dh, $some_dir) ||
die; <br>
while(readdir $dh) { <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be
users of your code who are running earlier versions of Perl
with mysterious failures, put this sort of thing at the top
of your file to signal <br>
that your code will work only on Perls of a recent
vintage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.012; # so readdir assigns

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readline EXPR <br>
readline <br>
Reads from the filehandle whose typeglob is contained in
EXPR (or from *ARGV if EXPR is not provided). In scalar
context, each call reads and returns the next line until
<br>
end-of-file is reached, whereupon the subsequent call
returns &quot;undef&quot;. In list context, reads until
end-of-file is reached and returns a list of lines. Note
that the notion <br>
of &quot;line&quot; used here is whatever you may have
defined with $/ or $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR). See
&quot;$/&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When $/ is set to
&quot;undef&quot;, when &quot;readline&quot; is in scalar
context (i.e., file slurp mode), and when an empty file is
read, it returns &rsquo;&rsquo; the first time, followed by
&quot;undef&quot; <br>
subsequently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the internal function
implementing the &quot;&lt;EXPR&gt;&quot; operator, but you
can use it directly. The &quot;&lt;EXPR&gt;&quot; operator

<br>
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; <br>
$line = readline(*STDIN); # same thing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;readline&quot;
encounters an operating system error, $! will be set with
the corresponding error message. It can be helpful to check
$! when you are reading from filehandles <br>
you don&rsquo;t trust, such as a tty or a socket. The
following example uses the operator form of
&quot;readline&quot; and dies if the result is not
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while ( ! eof($fh) ) { <br>
defined( $_ = &lt;$fh&gt; ) or die &quot;readline failed:
$!&quot;; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you have can&rsquo;t
handle &quot;readline&quot; errors that way with the
&quot;ARGV&quot; filehandle. In that case, you have to open
each element of @ARGV yourself since &quot;eof&quot; handles
<br>
&quot;ARGV&quot; differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach my $arg (@ARGV) { <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readlink EXPR <br>
readlink <br>
Returns the value of a symbolic link, if symbolic links are
implemented. If not, raises an exception. If there is a
system error, returns the undefined value and sets $! <br>
(errno). If EXPR is omitted, uses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;readlink&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readpipe EXPR <br>
readpipe <br>
EXPR is executed as a system command. The collected standard
output of the command is returned. In scalar context, it
comes back as a single (potentially multi-line) <br>
string. In list context, returns a list of lines (however
you&rsquo;ve defined lines with $/ or
$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR). This is the internal function
implementing the <br>
&quot;qx/EXPR/&quot; operator, but you can use it directly.
The &quot;qx/EXPR/&quot; operator is discussed in more
detail in &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop. If EXPR is
omitted, uses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recv SOCKET,SCALAR,LENGTH,FLAGS
<br>
Receives a message on a socket. Attempts to receive LENGTH
characters of data into variable SCALAR from the specified
SOCKET filehandle. SCALAR will be grown or shrunk to <br>
the length actually read. Takes the same flags as the system
call of the same name. Returns the address of the sender if
SOCKET&rsquo;s protocol supports this; returns an empty <br>
string otherwise. If there&rsquo;s an error, returns the
undefined value. This call is actually implemented in terms
of recvfrom(2) system call. See &quot;UDP: Message
Passing&quot; in <br>
perlipc for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the characters: depending
on the status of the socket, either (8-bit) bytes or
characters are received. By default all sockets operate on
bytes, but for example if the <br>
socket has been changed using binmode() to operate with the
&quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; I/O layer (see the
&quot;open&quot; pragma, open), the I/O will operate on
UTF8-encoded Unicode <br>
characters, not bytes. Similarly for the
&quot;:encoding&quot; pragma: in that case pretty much any
characters can be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redo LABEL <br>
redo <br>
The &quot;redo&quot; command restarts the loop block without
evaluating the conditional again. The &quot;continue&quot;
block, if any, is not executed. If the LABEL is omitted, the
command <br>
refers to the innermost enclosing loop. Programs that want
to lie to themselves about what was just input normally use
this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># a simpleminded Pascal comment
stripper <br>
# (warning: assumes no { or } in strings) <br>
LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { <br>
while (s|({.*}.*){.*}|$1 |) {} <br>
s|{.*}| |; <br>
if (s|{.*| |) { <br>
$front = $_; <br>
while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { <br>
if (/}/) { # end of comment? <br>
s|^|$front|; <br>
redo LINE; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
} <br>
print; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;redo&quot; cannot be used
to retry a block that returns a value such as &quot;eval
{}&quot;, &quot;sub {}&quot;, or &quot;do {}&quot;, and
should not be used to exit a grep() or map() operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a block by itself is
semantically identical to a loop that executes once. Thus
&quot;redo&quot; inside such a block will effectively turn
it into a looping construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;continue&quot;
for an illustration of how &quot;last&quot;,
&quot;next&quot;, and &quot;redo&quot; work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ref EXPR <br>
ref Returns a non-empty string if EXPR is a reference, the
empty string otherwise. If EXPR is not specified, $_ will be
used. The value returned depends on the type of thing <br>
the reference is a reference to. Builtin types include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALAR <br>
ARRAY <br>
HASH <br>
CODE <br>
REF <br>
GLOB <br>
LVALUE <br>
FORMAT <br>
IO <br>
VSTRING <br>
Regexp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the referenced object has
been blessed into a package, then that package name is
returned instead. You can think of &quot;ref&quot; as a
&quot;typeof&quot; operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (ref($r) eq &quot;HASH&quot;)
{ <br>
print &quot;r is a reference to a hash.0; <br>
} <br>
unless (ref($r)) { <br>
print &quot;r is not a reference at all.0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value
&quot;LVALUE&quot; indicates a reference to an lvalue that
is not a variable. You get this from taking the reference of
function calls like &quot;pos()&quot; or
&quot;substr()&quot;. <br>
&quot;VSTRING&quot; is returned if the reference points to a
version string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result &quot;Regexp&quot;
indicates that the argument is a regular expression
resulting from &quot;qr//&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename OLDNAME,NEWNAME <br>
Changes the name of a file; an existing file NEWNAME will be
clobbered. Returns true for success, false otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Behavior of this function varies
wildly depending on your system implementation. For example,
it will usually not work across file system boundaries, even
though the system <br>
mv command sometimes compensates for this. Other
restrictions include whether it works on directories, open
files, or pre-existing files. Check perlport and either the
<br>
rename(2) manpage or equivalent system documentation for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a platform independent
&quot;move&quot; function look at the File::Copy module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;rename&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require VERSION <br>
require EXPR <br>
require <br>
Demands a version of Perl specified by VERSION, or demands
some semantics specified by EXPR or by $_ if EXPR is not
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION may be either a numeric
argument such as 5.006, which will be compared to $], or a
literal of the form v5.6.1, which will be compared to $^V
(aka $PERL_VERSION). An <br>
exception is raised if VERSION is greater than the version
of the current Perl interpreter. Compare with
&quot;use&quot;, which can do a similar check at compile
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying VERSION as a literal
of the form v5.6.1 should generally be avoided, because it
leads to misleading error messages under earlier versions of
Perl that do not <br>
support this syntax. The equivalent numeric version should
be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require v5.6.1; # run time
version check <br>
require 5.6.1; # ditto <br>
require 5.006_001; # ditto; preferred for backwards
compatibility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, &quot;require&quot;
demands that a library file be included if it hasn&rsquo;t
already been included. The file is included via the do-FILE
mechanism, which is essentially just a <br>
variety of &quot;eval&quot; with the caveat that lexical
variables in the invoking script will be invisible to the
included code. Has semantics similar to the following
subroutine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub require { <br>
my ($filename) = @_; <br>
if (exists $INC{$filename}) { <br>
return 1 if $INC{$filename}; <br>
die &quot;Compilation failed in require&quot;; <br>
} <br>
my ($realfilename,$result); <br>
ITER: { <br>
foreach $prefix (@INC) { <br>
$realfilename = &quot;$prefix/$filename&quot;; <br>
if (-f $realfilename) { <br>
$INC{$filename} = $realfilename; <br>
$result = do $realfilename; <br>
last ITER; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t find $filename in @INC&quot;; <br>
} <br>
if ($@) { <br>
$INC{$filename} = undef; <br>
die $@; <br>
} elsif (!$result) { <br>
delete $INC{$filename}; <br>
die &quot;$filename did not return true value&quot;; <br>
} else { <br>
return $result; <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the file will not be
included twice under the same specified name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file must return true as the
last statement to indicate successful execution of any
initialization code, so it&rsquo;s customary to end such a
file with &quot;1;&quot; unless you&rsquo;re sure <br>
it&rsquo;ll return true otherwise. But it&rsquo;s better
just to put the &quot;1;&quot;, in case you add more
statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EXPR is a bareword, the
require assumes a &quot;.pm&quot; extension and replaces
&quot;::&quot; with &quot;/&quot; in the filename for you,
to make it easy to load standard modules. This form of <br>
loading of modules does not risk altering your
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, if you try
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require Foo::Bar; # a splendid
bareword</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The require function will
actually look for the &quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot; file in the
directories specified in the @INC array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you try this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$class = &rsquo;Foo::Bar&rsquo;;
<br>
require $class; # $class is not a bareword <br>
#or <br>
require &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;; # not a bareword because of
the &quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The require function will look
for the &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; file in the @INC array and will
complain about not finding &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; there. In
this case you can do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &quot;require
$class&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that you understand how
&quot;require&quot; looks for files with a bareword
argument, there is a little extra functionality going on
behind the scenes. Before &quot;require&quot; looks for <br>
a &quot;.pm&quot; extension, it will first look for a
similar filename with a &quot;.pmc&quot; extension. If this
file is found, it will be loaded in place of any file ending
in a &quot;.pm&quot; <br>
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also insert hooks into
the import facility by putting Perl code directly into the
@INC array. There are three forms of hooks: subroutine
references, array <br>
references, and blessed objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subroutine references are the
simplest case. When the inclusion system walks through @INC
and encounters a subroutine, this subroutine gets called
with two parameters, the <br>
first a reference to itself, and the second the name of the
file to be included (e.g., &quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot;). The
subroutine should return either nothing or else a list of up
to <br>
three values in the following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A filehandle, from which the
file will be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A reference to a subroutine.
If there is no filehandle (previous item), then this
subroutine is expected to generate one line of source code
per call, writing the line <br>
into $_ and returning 1, then finally at end of file
returning 0. If there is a filehandle, then the subroutine
will be called to act as a simple source filter, with the
<br>
line as read in $_. Again, return 1 for each valid line, and
0 after all lines have been returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Optional state for the
subroutine. The state is passed in as $_[1]. A reference to
the subroutine itself is passed in as $_[0].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an empty list,
&quot;undef&quot;, or nothing that matches the first 3
values above is returned, then &quot;require&quot; looks at
the remaining elements of @INC. Note that this filehandle
<br>
must be a real filehandle (strictly a typeglob or reference
to a typeglob, whether blessed or unblessed); tied
filehandles will be ignored and processing will stop
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the hook is an array
reference, its first element must be a subroutine reference.
This subroutine is called as above, but the first parameter
is the array reference. <br>
This lets you indirectly pass arguments to the
subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, you can
write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push @INC, my_sub; <br>
sub my_sub { <br>
my ($coderef, $filename) = @_; # $coderef is my_sub <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push @INC, [ my_sub, $x, $y, ...
]; <br>
sub my_sub { <br>
my ($arrayref, $filename) = @_; <br>
# Retrieve $x, $y, ... <br>
my @parameters = @$arrayref[1..$#$arrayref]; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the hook is an object, it
must provide an INC method that will be called as above, the
first parameter being the object itself. (Note that you must
fully qualify the <br>
sub&rsquo;s name, as unqualified &quot;INC&quot; is always
forced into package &quot;main&quot;.) Here is a typical
code layout:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># In Foo.pm <br>
package Foo; <br>
sub new { ... } <br>
sub Foo::INC { <br>
my ($self, $filename) = @_; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># In the main program <br>
push @INC, Foo-&gt;new(...);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These hooks are also permitted
to set the %INC entry corresponding to the files they have
loaded. See &quot;%INC&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a yet-more-powerful import
facility, see &quot;use&quot; and perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset EXPR <br>
reset <br>
Generally used in a &quot;continue&quot; block at the end of
a loop to clear variables and reset &quot;??&quot; searches
so that they work again. The expression is interpreted as a
list of <br>
single characters (hyphens allowed for ranges). All
variables and arrays beginning with one of those letters are
reset to their pristine state. If the expression is <br>
omitted, one-match searches (&quot;?pattern?&quot;) are
reset to match again. Only resets variables or searches in
the current package. Always returns 1. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset &rsquo;X&rsquo;; # reset
all X variables <br>
reset &rsquo;a-z&rsquo;; # reset lower case variables <br>
reset; # just reset ?one-time? searches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resetting &quot;A-Z&quot; is not
recommended because you&rsquo;ll wipe out your @ARGV and
@INC arrays and your %ENV hash. Resets only package
variables; lexical variables are unaffected, <br>
but they clean themselves up on scope exit anyway, so
you&rsquo;ll probably want to use them instead. See
&quot;my&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return EXPR <br>
return <br>
Returns from a subroutine, &quot;eval&quot;, or &quot;do
FILE&quot; with the value given in EXPR. Evaluation of EXPR
may be in list, scalar, or void context, depending on how
the return value <br>
will be used, and the context may vary from one execution to
the next (see &quot;wantarray&quot;). If no EXPR is given,
returns an empty list in list context, the undefined value
in <br>
scalar context, and (of course) nothing at all in void
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In the absence of an explicit
&quot;return&quot;, a subroutine, eval, or do FILE
automatically returns the value of the last expression
evaluated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reverse LIST <br>
In list context, returns a list value consisting of the
elements of LIST in the opposite order. In scalar context,
concatenates the elements of LIST and returns a string <br>
value with all characters in the opposite order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&quot;, &quot;,
reverse &quot;world&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;); # Hello,
world</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print scalar reverse &quot;dlrow
,&quot;, &quot;olleH&quot;; # Hello, world</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used without arguments in scalar
context, reverse() reverses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$_ = &quot;dlrow ,olleH&quot;;
<br>
print reverse; # No output, list context <br>
print scalar reverse; # Hello, world</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that reversing an array to
itself (as in &quot;@a = reverse @a&quot;) will preserve
non-existent elements whenever possible, i.e., for non
magical arrays or tied arrays with <br>
&quot;EXISTS&quot; and &quot;DELETE&quot; methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This operator is also handy for
inverting a hash, although there are some caveats. If a
value is duplicated in the original hash, only one of those
can be represented as a <br>
key in the inverted hash. Also, this has to unwind one hash
and build a whole new one, which may take some time on a
large hash, such as from a DBM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%by_name = reverse %by_address;
# Invert the hash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rewinddir DIRHANDLE <br>
Sets the current position to the beginning of the directory
for the &quot;readdir&quot; routine on DIRHANDLE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;rewinddir&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rindex STR,SUBSTR,POSITION <br>
rindex STR,SUBSTR <br>
Works just like index() except that it returns the position
of the last occurrence of SUBSTR in STR. If POSITION is
specified, returns the last occurrence beginning at or <br>
before that position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir FILENAME <br>
rmdir <br>
Deletes the directory specified by FILENAME if that
directory is empty. If it succeeds it returns true;
otherwise it returns false and sets $! (errno). If FILENAME
is <br>
omitted, uses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove a directory tree
recursively (&quot;rm -rf&quot; on Unix) look at the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">say FILEHANDLE LIST <br>

say Just like &quot;print&quot;, but implicitly appends a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar EXPR <br>
Forces EXPR to be interpreted in scalar context and returns
the value of EXPR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@counts = ( scalar @a, scalar
@b, scalar @c );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no equivalent operator

wanted to do so, however, <br>
you could use the construction &quot;@{[ (some expression)

suffices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because &quot;scalar&quot; is a
unary operator, if you accidentally use a parenthesized list
for the EXPR, this behaves as a scalar comma expression,
evaluating all but the last <br>
element in void context and returning the final element
evaluated in scalar context. This is seldom what you

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlop for more details on

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE
<br>
Sets FILEHANDLE&rsquo;s position, just like the
&quot;fseek&quot; call of &quot;stdio&quot;. FILEHANDLE may
be an expression whose value gives the name of the
filehandle. The values for WHENCE are 0 <br>
to set the new position in bytes to POSITION; 1 to set it to
the current position plus POSITION; and 2 to set it to EOF
plus POSITION, typically negative. For WHENCE you may <br>
use the constants &quot;SEEK_SET&quot;,
&quot;SEEK_CUR&quot;, and &quot;SEEK_END&quot; (start of the
file, current position, end of the file) from the Fcntl
module. Returns 1 on success, false otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the in bytes: even if the
filehandle has been set to operate on characters (for
example by using the &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; open
layer), tell() will return byte offsets, not <br>
character offsets (because implementing that would render
seek() and tell() rather slow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to position the file
for &quot;sysread&quot; or &quot;syswrite&quot;, don&rsquo;t
use &quot;seek&quot;, because buffering makes its effect on
the file&rsquo;s read-write position unpredictable and non-
<br>
portable. Use &quot;sysseek&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the rules and rigors of
ANSI C, on some systems you have to do a seek whenever you
switch between reading and writing. Amongst other things,
this may have the effect <br>
of calling stdio&rsquo;s clearerr(3). A WHENCE of 1
(&quot;SEEK_CUR&quot;) is useful for not moving the file
position:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek(TEST,0,1);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is also useful for
applications emulating &quot;tail -f&quot;. Once you hit EOF
on your read and then sleep for a while, you (probably) have
to stick in a dummy seek() to reset <br>
things. The &quot;seek&quot; doesn&rsquo;t change the
position, but it does clear the end-of-file condition on the
handle, so that the next &quot;&lt;FILE&gt;&quot; makes Perl
try again to read something. <br>
(We hope.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that doesn&rsquo;t work (some
I/O implementations are particularly cantankerous), you
might need something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (;;) { <br>
for ($curpos = tell(FILE); $_ = &lt;FILE&gt;; <br>
$curpos = tell(FILE)) { <br>
# search for some stuff and put it into files <br>
} <br>
sleep($for_a_while); <br>
seek(FILE, $curpos, 0); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS <br>
Sets the current position for the &quot;readdir&quot;
routine on DIRHANDLE. POS must be a value returned by
&quot;telldir&quot;. &quot;seekdir&quot; also has the same
caveats about possible directory <br>
compaction as the corresponding system library routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select FILEHANDLE <br>
select <br>
Returns the currently selected filehandle. If FILEHANDLE is
supplied, sets the new current default filehandle for
output. This has two effects: first, a &quot;write&quot; or
a <br>
&quot;print&quot; without a filehandle default to this
FILEHANDLE. Second, references to variables related to
output will refer to this output channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to set the
top-of-form format for more than one output channel, you
might do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select(REPORT1); <br>
$^ = &rsquo;report1_top&rsquo;; <br>
select(REPORT2); <br>
$^ = &rsquo;report2_top&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILEHANDLE may be an expression
whose value gives the name of the actual filehandle.
Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$oldfh = select(STDERR); $| = 1;
select($oldfh);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some programmers may prefer to
think of filehandles as objects with methods, preferring to
write the last example as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use IO::Handle; <br>
STDERR-&gt;autoflush(1);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;select&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select RBITS,WBITS,EBITS,TIMEOUT
<br>
This calls the select(2) syscall with the bit masks
specified, which can be constructed using &quot;fileno&quot;
and &quot;vec&quot;, along these lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$rin = $win = $ein =
&rsquo;&rsquo;; <br>
vec($rin, fileno(STDIN), 1) = 1; <br>
vec($win, fileno(STDOUT), 1) = 1; <br>
$ein = $rin | $win;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to select on many
filehandles, you may wish to write a subroutine like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub fhbits { <br>
my @fhlist = @_; <br>
my $bits = &quot;&quot;; <br>
for my $fh (@fhlist) { <br>
vec($bits, fileno($fh), 1) = 1; <br>
} <br>
return $bits; <br>
} <br>
$rin = fhbits(*STDIN, *TTY, *MYSOCK);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual idiom is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($nfound,$timeleft) = <br>
select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, $timeout);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or to block until something
becomes ready just do this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$nfound = select($rout=$rin,
$wout=$win, $eout=$ein, undef);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most systems do not bother to
return anything useful in $timeleft, so calling select() in
scalar context just returns $nfound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any of the bit masks can also be
undef. The timeout, if specified, is in seconds, which may
be fractional. Note: not all implementations are capable of
returning the <br>
$timeleft. If not, they always return $timeleft equal to the
supplied $timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can effect a sleep of 250
milliseconds this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select(undef, undef, undef,
0.25);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that whether
&quot;select&quot; gets restarted after signals (say,
SIGALRM) is implementation-dependent. See also perlport for
notes on the portability of &quot;select&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On error, &quot;select&quot;
behaves just like select(2): it returns -1 and sets $!.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some Unixes, select(2) may
report a socket file descriptor as &quot;ready for
reading&quot; even when no data is available, and thus any
subsequent &quot;read&quot; would block. This can be <br>
avoided if you always use O_NONBLOCK on the socket. See
select(2) and fcntl(2) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard
&quot;IO::Select&quot; module provides a user-friendlier
interface to &quot;select&quot;, mostly because it does all
the bit-mask work for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: One should not attempt
to mix buffered I/O (like &quot;read&quot; or &lt;FH&gt;)

a packed array of semop structures. Each semop structure
<br>
can be generated with &quot;pack(&quot;s!3&quot;, $semnum,

send SOCKET,MSG,FLAGS <br>
Sends a message on a socket. Attempts to send the scalar MSG
to the SOCKET filehandle. Takes the same flags as the system
call of the same name. On unconnected sockets, <br>
you must specify a destination to send to, in which case it
does a sendto(2) syscall. Returns the number of characters
sent, or the undefined value on error. The sendmsg(2) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the characters: depending
on the status of the socket, either (8-bit) bytes or

bytes, but for example if the <br>
socket has been changed using binmode() to operate with the
&quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; I/O layer (see &quot;open&quot;,
or the &quot;open&quot; pragma, open), the I/O will operate

characters can be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setpgrp PID,PGRP <br>
Sets the current process group for the specified PID, 0 for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort SUBNAME LIST <br>
sort BLOCK LIST <br>
sort LIST <br>
In list context, this sorts the LIST and returns the sorted
list value. In scalar context, the behaviour of
&quot;sort()&quot; is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SUBNAME or BLOCK is omitted,
&quot;sort&quot;s in standard string comparison order. If
SUBNAME is specified, it gives the name of a subroutine that
returns an integer less than, <br>
equal to, or greater than 0, depending on how the elements
of the list are to be ordered. (The &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;
and &quot;cmp&quot; operators are extremely useful in such
routines.) SUBNAME may <br>
be a scalar variable name (unsubscripted), in which case the
value provides the name of (or a reference to) the actual
subroutine to use. In place of a SUBNAME, you can <br>
provide a BLOCK as an anonymous, in-line sort
subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the subroutine&rsquo;s
prototype is &quot;($$)&quot;, the elements to be compared
are passed by reference in @_, as for a normal subroutine.
This is slower than unprototyped subroutines, <br>
where the elements to be compared are passed into the
subroutine as the package global variables $a and $b (see
example below). Note that in the latter case, it is usually
<br>
highly counter-productive to declare $a and $b as
lexicals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the subroutine is an XSUB,
the elements to be compared are pushed on to the stack, the
way arguments are usually passed to XSUBs. $a and $b are not
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values to be compared are
always passed by reference and should not be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also cannot exit out of the
sort block or subroutine using any of the loop control
operators described in perlsyn or with &quot;goto&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;use locale&quot; (but
not &quot;use locale &rsquo;not_characters&rsquo;&quot;) is
in effect, &quot;sort LIST&quot; sorts LIST according to the
current collation locale. See perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort() returns aliases into the
original list, much as a for loop&rsquo;s index variable
aliases the list elements. That is, modifying an element of
a list returned by sort() (for <br>
example, in a &quot;foreach&quot;, &quot;map&quot; or
&quot;grep&quot;) actually modifies the element in the
original list. This is usually something to be avoided when
writing clear code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.6 and earlier used a
quicksort algorithm to implement sort. That algorithm was
not stable, so could go quadratic. (A stable sort preserves
the input order of <br>
elements that compare equal. Although quicksort&rsquo;s run
time is O(NlogN) when averaged over all arrays of length N,
the time can be O(N**2), quadratic behavior, for some <br>
inputs.) In 5.7, the quicksort implementation was replaced
with a stable mergesort algorithm whose worst-case behavior
is O(NlogN). But benchmarks indicated that for some <br>
inputs, on some platforms, the original quicksort was
faster. 5.8 has a sort pragma for limited control of the
sort. Its rather blunt control of the underlying algorithm
<br>
may not persist into future Perls, but the ability to
characterize the input or output in implementation
independent ways quite probably will. See the sort
pragma.</p>

Removes the elements designated by OFFSET and LENGTH from an

In list context, returns the elements removed from <br>
the array. In scalar context, returns the last element
removed, or &quot;undef&quot; if no elements are removed.
The array grows or shrinks as necessary. If OFFSET is
negative then <br>
it starts that far from the end of the array. If LENGTH is
omitted, removes everything from OFFSET onward. If LENGTH is
negative, removes the elements from OFFSET onward <br>
except for -LENGTH elements at the end of the array. If both
OFFSET and LENGTH are omitted, removes everything. If OFFSET
is past the end of the array, Perl issues a <br>
warning, and splices at the end of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,

&quot;splice&quot; is considered highly experimental. The
exact behaviour may change in a future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split /PATTERN/,EXPR,LIMIT <br>
split /PATTERN/,EXPR <br>
split /PATTERN/ <br>
split <br>
Splits the string EXPR into a list of strings and returns
the list in list context, or the size of the list in scalar
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only PATTERN is given, EXPR
defaults to $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anything in EXPR that matches
PATTERN is taken to be a separator that separates the EXPR
into substrings (called &quot;fields&quot;) that do not
include the separator. Note that a <br>
separator may be longer than one character or even have no
characters at all (the empty string, which is a zero-width
match).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PATTERN need not be
constant; an expression may be used to specify a pattern
that varies at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If PATTERN matches the empty
string, the EXPR is split at the match position (between
characters). As an example, the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(&rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;abc&rsquo;)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uses the &rsquo;b&rsquo; in
&rsquo;abc&rsquo; as a separator to produce the output
&rsquo;a:c&rsquo;. However, this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(&rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;abc&rsquo;)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uses empty string matches as
separators to produce the output &rsquo;a:b:c&rsquo;; thus,
the empty string may be used to split EXPR into a list of
its component characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case for
&quot;split&quot;, the empty pattern given in match operator
syntax (&quot;//&quot;) specifically matches the empty
string, which is contrary to its usual interpretation as
<br>
the last successful match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If PATTERN is &quot;/^/&quot;,
then it is treated as if it used the multiline modifier
(&quot;/^/m&quot;), since it isn&rsquo;t much use
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As another special case,
&quot;split&quot; emulates the default behavior of the
command line tool awk when the PATTERN is either omitted or
a literal string composed of a single space <br>
character (such as &rsquo; &rsquo; or &quot;0&quot;, but not
e.g. &quot;/ /&quot;). In this case, any leading whitespace
in EXPR is removed before splitting occurs, and the PATTERN
is instead treated as <br>
if it were &quot;/&quot;; in particular, this means that any
contiguous whitespace (not just a single space character) is
used as a separator. However, this special treatment can
<br>
be avoided by specifying the pattern &quot;/ /&quot; instead
of the string &quot; &quot;, thereby allowing only a single
space character to be a separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If omitted, PATTERN defaults to
a single space, &quot; &quot;, triggering the previously
described awk emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LIMIT is specified and
positive, it represents the maximum number of fields into
which the EXPR may be split; in other words, LIMIT is one
greater than the maximum number <br>
of times EXPR may be split. Thus, the LIMIT value 1 means
that EXPR may be split a maximum of zero times, producing a
maximum of one field (namely, the entire value of <br>
EXPR). For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(//, &rsquo;abc&rsquo;, 1)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output
&rsquo;abc&rsquo;, and this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(//, &rsquo;abc&rsquo;, 2)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output
&rsquo;a:bc&rsquo;, and each of these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(//, &rsquo;abc&rsquo;, 3)), &quot;0; <br>
print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;, split(//, &rsquo;abc&rsquo;,
4)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output
&rsquo;a:b:c&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LIMIT is negative, it is
treated as if it were instead arbitrarily large; as many
fields as possible are produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LIMIT is omitted (or,
equivalently, zero), then it is usually treated as if it
were instead negative but with the exception that trailing
empty fields are stripped (empty <br>
leading fields are always preserved); if all fields are
empty, then all fields are considered to be trailing (and
are thus stripped in this case). Thus, the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(&rsquo;,&rsquo;, &rsquo;a,b,c,,,&rsquo;)),
&quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output
&rsquo;a:b:c&rsquo;, but the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(&rsquo;,&rsquo;, &rsquo;a,b,c,,,&rsquo;, -1)),
&quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output
&rsquo;a:b:c:::&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In time-critical applications,
it is worthwhile to avoid splitting into more fields than
necessary. Thus, when assigning to a list, if LIMIT is
omitted (or zero), then LIMIT <br>
is treated as though it were one larger than the number of
variables in the list; for the following, LIMIT is
implicitly 4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($login, $passwd, $remainder) =
split(/:/);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that splitting an EXPR that
evaluates to the empty string always produces zero fields,
regardless of the LIMIT specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty leading field is
produced when there is a positive-width match at the
beginning of EXPR. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(/ /, &rsquo; abc&rsquo;)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output
&rsquo;:abc&rsquo;. However, a zero-width match at the
beginning of EXPR never produces an empty field, so
that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(//, &rsquo; abc&rsquo;));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output &rsquo;
:a:b:c&rsquo; (rather than &rsquo;: :a:b:c&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty trailing field, on the
other hand, is produced when there is a match at the end of
EXPR, regardless of the length of the match (of course,
unless a non-zero LIMIT is <br>
given explicitly, such fields are removed, as in the last
example). Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print join(&rsquo;:&rsquo;,
split(//, &rsquo; abc&rsquo;, -1)), &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the output &rsquo;
:a:b:c:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the PATTERN contains
capturing groups, then for each separator, an additional
field is produced for each substring captured by a group (in
the order in which the groups <br>
are specified, as per backreferences); if any group does not
match, then it captures the &quot;undef&quot; value instead
of a substring. Also, note that any such additional field is
<br>
produced whenever there is a separator (that is, whenever a
split occurs), and such an additional field does not count
towards the LIMIT. Consider the following expressions <br>
evaluated in list context (each returned list is provided in
the associated comment):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split(/-|,/,
&quot;1-10,20&quot;, 3) <br>
# (&rsquo;1&rsquo;, &rsquo;10&rsquo;, &rsquo;20&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split(/(-|,)/,
&quot;1-10,20&quot;, 3) <br>
# (&rsquo;1&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo;, &rsquo;10&rsquo;,

&rsquo;20&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sprintf FORMAT, LIST <br>
Returns a string formatted by the usual &quot;printf&quot;
conventions of the C library function &quot;sprintf&quot;.
See below for more details and see sprintf(3) or printf(3)
on your system <br>
for an explanation of the general principles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Format number with up to 8
leading zeroes <br>
$result = sprintf(&quot;%08d&quot;, $number);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Round number to 3 digits after
decimal point <br>
$rounded = sprintf(&quot;%.3f&quot;, $number);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl does its own
&quot;sprintf&quot; formatting: it emulates the C function
sprintf(3), but doesn&rsquo;t use it except for
floating-point numbers, and even then only standard
modifiers are <br>
allowed. Non-standard extensions in your local sprintf(3)
are therefore unavailable from Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike &quot;printf&quot;,
&quot;sprintf&quot; does not do what you probably mean when
you pass it an array as your first argument. The array is
given scalar context, and instead of using the <br>
0th element of the array as the format, Perl will use the
count of elements in the array as the format, which is
almost never useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s &quot;sprintf&quot;
permits the following universally-known conversions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% a percent sign <br>
%c a character with the given number <br>
%s a string <br>
%d a signed integer, in decimal <br>
%u an unsigned integer, in decimal <br>
%o an unsigned integer, in octal <br>
%x an unsigned integer, in hexadecimal <br>
%e a floating-point number, in scientific notation <br>
%f a floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation <br>
%g a floating-point number, in %e or %f notation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, Perl permits the
following widely-supported conversions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%X like %x, but using upper-case
letters <br>
%E like %e, but using an upper-case &quot;E&quot; <br>
%G like %g, but with an upper-case &quot;E&quot; (if
applicable) <br>
%b an unsigned integer, in binary <br>
%B like %b, but using an upper-case &quot;B&quot; with the #
flag <br>
%p a pointer (outputs the Perl value&rsquo;s address in
hexadecimal) <br>
%n special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
<br>
into the next argument in the parameter list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, for backward (and we do
mean &quot;backward&quot;) compatibility, Perl permits these
unnecessary but widely-supported conversions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i a synonym for %d <br>
%D a synonym for %ld <br>
%U a synonym for %lu <br>
%O a synonym for %lo <br>
%F a synonym for %f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the number of exponent
digits in the scientific notation produced by %e, %E, %g and
%G for numbers with the modulus of the exponent less than
100 is system- <br>
dependent: it may be three or less (zero-padded as
necessary). In other words, 1.23 times ten to the 99th may
be either &quot;1.23e99&quot; or &quot;1.23e099&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Between the &quot;%&quot; and
the format letter, you may specify several additional
attributes controlling the interpretation of the format. In
order, these are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format parameter index <br>
An explicit format parameter index, such as &quot;2$&quot;.
By default sprintf will format the next unused argument in
the list, but this allows you to take the arguments out of
<br>
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &rsquo;%2$d %1$d&rsquo;,
12, 34; # prints &quot;34 12&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;%3$d %d %1$d&rsquo;, 1, 2, 3; # prints &quot;3
1 1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags <br>
one or more of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">space prefix non-negative number
with a space <br>
+ prefix non-negative number with a plus sign <br>
- left-justify within the field <br>
0 use zeros, not spaces, to right-justify <br>
# ensure the leading &quot;0&quot; for any octal, <br>
prefix non-zero hexadecimal with &quot;0x&quot; or
&quot;0X&quot;, <br>
prefix non-zero binary with &quot;0b&quot; or
&quot;0B&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &rsquo;&lt;%
d&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints &quot;&lt; 12&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%+d&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;+12&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%6s&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints &quot;&lt;
12&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%-6s&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints &quot;&lt;12
&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%06s&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;000012&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#o&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;014&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#x&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;0xc&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#X&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;0XC&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#b&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;0b1100&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#B&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;0B1100&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a space and a plus sign are
given as the flags at once, a plus sign is used to prefix a
positive number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &rsquo;&lt;%+
d&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints &quot;&lt;+12&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;% +d&gt;&rsquo;, 12; # prints
&quot;&lt;+12&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the # flag and a precision
are given in the %o conversion, the precision is incremented
if it&rsquo;s necessary for the leading &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%#.5o&gt;&rsquo;, 012; # prints
&quot;&lt;00012&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#.5o&gt;&rsquo;, 012345; # prints
&quot;&lt;012345&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#.0o&gt;&rsquo;, 0; # prints
&quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vector flag <br>
This flag tells Perl to interpret the supplied string as a
vector of integers, one for each character in the string.
Perl applies the format to each integer in turn, <br>
then joins the resulting strings with a separator (a dot
&quot;.&quot; by default). This can be useful for displaying
ordinal values of characters in arbitrary strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;%vd&quot;,
&quot;AB&quot;; # prints &quot;65.66.256&quot; <br>
printf &quot;version is v%vd0, $^V; # Perl&rsquo;s
version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put an asterisk &quot;*&quot;
before the &quot;v&quot; to override the string to use to
separate the numbers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;address is %*vX0,
&quot;:&quot;, $addr; # IPv6 address <br>
printf &quot;bits are %0*v8b0, &quot; &quot;, $bits; #
random bitstring</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also explicitly specify
the argument number to use for the join string using
something like &quot;*2$v&quot;; for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &rsquo;%*4$vX %*4$vX
%*4$vX&rsquo;, @addr[1..3], &quot;:&quot;; # 3 IPv6
addresses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(minimum) width <br>
Arguments are usually formatted to be only as wide as
required to display the given value. You can override the
width by putting a number here, or get the width from the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a field width obtained
through &quot;*&quot; is negative, it has the same effect as
the &quot;-&quot; flag: left-justification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">precision, or maximum width <br>
You can specify a precision (for numeric conversions) or a
maximum width (for string conversions) by specifying a
&quot;.&quot; followed by a number. For floating-point
formats <br>
except &quot;g&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, this specifies how
many places right of the decimal point to show (the default
being 6). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># these examples are subject to
system-specific variation <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%f&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;1.000000&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.1f&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;1.0&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.0f&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%e&gt;&rsquo;, 10; # prints
&quot;&lt;1.000000e+01&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.1e&gt;&rsquo;, 10; # prints
&quot;&lt;1.0e+01&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For &quot;g&quot; and
&quot;G&quot;, this specifies the maximum number of digits
to show, including those prior to the decimal point and
those after it; for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># These examples are subject to
system-specific variation. <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%g&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.10g&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%g&gt;&rsquo;, 100; # prints
&quot;&lt;100&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.1g&gt;&rsquo;, 100; # prints
&quot;&lt;1e+02&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.2g&gt;&rsquo;, 100.01; # prints
&quot;&lt;1e+02&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.5g&gt;&rsquo;, 100.01; # prints
&quot;&lt;100.01&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.4g&gt;&rsquo;, 100.01; # prints
&quot;&lt;100&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For integer conversions,
specifying a precision implies that the output of the number
itself should be zero-padded to this width, where the 0 flag
is ignored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%.6d&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%+.6d&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;+000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%-10.6d&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;000001 &gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%10.6d&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints &quot;&lt;
000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%010.6d&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints &quot;&lt;
000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%+10.6d&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints &quot;&lt;
+000001&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;0x000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%-10.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;000001 &gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%10.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints &quot;&lt;
000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%010.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints &quot;&lt;
000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%#10.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints &quot;&lt;
0x000001&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For string conversions,
specifying a precision truncates the string to fit the
specified width:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%.5s&gt;&rsquo;, &quot;truncated&quot;; # prints
&quot;&lt;trunc&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%10.5s&gt;&rsquo;, &quot;truncated&quot;;
# prints &quot;&lt; trunc&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also get the precision
from the next argument using &quot;.*&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%.6x&gt;&rsquo;, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.*x&gt;&rsquo;, 6, 1; # prints
&quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a precision obtained through
&quot;*&quot; is negative, it counts as having no precision
at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%.*s&gt;&rsquo;, 7, &quot;string&quot;; # prints
&quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.*s&gt;&rsquo;, 3, &quot;string&quot;; #
prints &quot;&lt;str&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.*s&gt;&rsquo;, 0, &quot;string&quot;; #
prints &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.*s&gt;&rsquo;, -1, &quot;string&quot;; #
prints &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&rsquo;&lt;%.*d&gt;&rsquo;, 1, 0; # prints
&quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.*d&gt;&rsquo;, 0, 0; # prints
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; <br>
printf &rsquo;&lt;%.*d&gt;&rsquo;, -1, 0; # prints
&quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot currently get the
precision from a specified number, but it is intended that
this will be possible in the future, for example using
&quot;.*2$&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&quot;&lt;%.*2$x&gt;&quot;, 1, 6; # INVALID, but in future
will print &quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size <br>
For numeric conversions, you can specify the size to
interpret the number as using &quot;l&quot;, &quot;h&quot;,
&quot;V&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, or
&quot;ll&quot;. For integer conversions (&quot;d u o x X b i
D U O&quot;), <br>
numbers are usually assumed to be whatever the default
integer size is on your platform (usually 32 or 64 bits),
but you can override this to use instead one of the <br>
standard C types, as supported by the compiler used to build
Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh interpret integer as C type
&quot;char&quot; or &quot;unsigned char&quot; <br>
on Perl 5.14 or later <br>
h interpret integer as C type &quot;short&quot; or
&quot;unsigned short&quot; <br>
j interpret integer as C type &quot;intmax_t&quot; on Perl
5.14 <br>
or later, and only with a C99 compiler (unportable) <br>
l interpret integer as C type &quot;long&quot; or
&quot;unsigned long&quot; <br>
q, L, or ll interpret integer as C type &quot;long
long&quot;, &quot;unsigned long long&quot;, <br>
or &quot;quad&quot; (typically 64-bit integers) <br>
t interpret integer as C type &quot;ptrdiff_t&quot; on Perl
5.14 or later <br>
z interpret integer as C type &quot;size_t&quot; on Perl
5.14 or later</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of 5.14, none of these raises
an exception if they are not supported on your platform.
However, if warnings are enabled, a warning of the
&quot;printf&quot; warning class is <br>
issued on an unsupported conversion flag. Should you instead
prefer an exception, do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use warnings FATAL =&gt;
&quot;printf&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to know about
a version dependency before you start running the program,
put something like this at its top:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.014; # for hh/j/t/z/
printf modifiers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find out whether your
Perl supports quads via Config:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
if ($Config{use64bitint} eq &quot;define&quot; ||
$Config{longsize} &gt;= 8) { <br>
print &quot;Nice quads!0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For floating-point conversions
(&quot;e f g E F G&quot;), numbers are usually assumed to be
the default floating-point size on your platform (double or
long double), but you can <br>
force &quot;long double&quot; with &quot;q&quot;,
&quot;L&quot;, or &quot;ll&quot; if your platform supports
them. You can find out whether your Perl supports long
doubles via Config:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
print &quot;long doubles0 if $Config{d_longdbl} eq
&quot;define&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find out whether Perl
considers &quot;long double&quot; to be the default
floating-point size to use on your platform via Config:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
if ($Config{uselongdouble} eq &quot;define&quot;) { <br>
print &quot;long doubles by default0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can also be that long doubles
and doubles are the same thing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
($Config{doublesize} == $Config{longdblsize}) &amp;&amp;
<br>
print &quot;doubles are long doubles0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size specifier &quot;V&quot;
has no effect for Perl code, but is supported for
compatibility with XS code. It means &quot;use the standard
size for a Perl integer or floating-point <br>
number&quot;, which is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">order of arguments <br>
Normally, sprintf() takes the next unused argument as the
value to format for each format specification. If the format
specification uses &quot;*&quot; to require additional <br>
arguments, these are consumed from the argument list in the
order they appear in the format specification before the
value to format. Where an argument is specified by <br>
an explicit index, this does not affect the normal order for
the arguments, even when the explicitly specified index
would have been the next argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&quot;&lt;%*.*s&gt;&quot;, $a, $b, $c;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uses $a for the width, $b for
the precision, and $c as the value to format; while:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf
&quot;&lt;%*1$.*s&gt;&quot;, $a, $b;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would use $a for the width and
precision, and $b as the value to format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some more examples; be
aware that when using an explicit index, the &quot;$&quot;
may need escaping:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;%2 %d0, 12, 34; #
will print &quot;34 120 <br>
printf &quot;%2 %d %d0, 12, 34; # will print &quot;34 12 340
<br>
printf &quot;%3 %d %d0, 12, 34, 56; # will print &quot;56 12
340 <br>
printf &quot;%23 %d0, 12, 34, 3; # will print &quot; 34
120</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;use locale&quot;
(including &quot;use locale
&rsquo;not_characters&rsquo;&quot;) is in effect and
POSIX::setlocale() has been called, the character used for
the decimal separator in formatted <br>
floating-point numbers is affected by the LC_NUMERIC locale.
See perllocale and POSIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sqrt EXPR <br>
sqrt <br>
Return the positive square root of EXPR. If EXPR is omitted,
uses $_. Works only for non-negative operands unless
you&rsquo;ve loaded the &quot;Math::Complex&quot;
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Math::Complex; <br>
print sqrt(-4); # prints 2i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">srand EXPR <br>
srand <br>
Sets and returns the random number seed for the
&quot;rand&quot; operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The point of the function is to
&quot;seed&quot; the &quot;rand&quot; function so that
&quot;rand&quot; can produce a different sequence each time
you run your program. When called with a parameter, <br>
&quot;srand&quot; uses that for the seed; otherwise it
(semi-)randomly chooses a seed. In either case, starting
with Perl 5.14, it returns the seed. To signal that your
code will <br>
work only on Perls of a recent vintage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.014; # so srand returns
the seed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;srand()&quot; is not
called explicitly, it is called implicitly without a
parameter at the first use of the &quot;rand&quot; operator.
However, this was not true of versions of Perl <br>
before 5.004, so if your script will run under older Perl
versions, it should call &quot;srand&quot;; otherwise most
programs won&rsquo;t call &quot;srand()&quot; at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But there are a few situations
in recent Perls where programs are likely to want to call
&quot;srand&quot;. One is for generating predictable results
generally for testing or <br>
debugging. There, you use &quot;srand($seed)&quot;, with the
same $seed each time. Another case is that you may want to
call &quot;srand()&quot; after a &quot;fork()&quot; to avoid
child processes <br>
sharing the same seed value as the parent (and consequently
each other).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not call &quot;srand()&quot;
(i.e., without an argument) more than once per process. The
internal state of the random number generator should contain
more entropy than can be <br>
provided by any seed, so calling &quot;srand()&quot; again
actually loses randomness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most implementations of
&quot;srand&quot; take an integer and will silently truncate
decimal numbers. This means &quot;srand(42)&quot; will
usually produce the same results as &quot;srand(42.1)&quot;.
<br>
To be safe, always pass &quot;srand&quot; an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In versions of Perl prior to
5.004 the default seed was just the current
&quot;time&quot;. This isn&rsquo;t a particularly good seed,
so many old programs supply their own seed value (often <br>
&quot;time ^ $$&quot; or &quot;time ^ ($$ + ($$ &lt;&lt;
15))&quot;), but that isn&rsquo;t necessary any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frequently called programs (like
CGI scripts) that simply use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time ^ $$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for a seed can fall prey to the
mathematical property that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a^b == (a+1)^(b+1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one-third of the time. So
don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical use of the returned
seed is for a test program which has too many combinations
to test comprehensively in the time available to it each
run. It can test a random <br>
subset each time, and should there be a failure, log the
seed used for that run so that it can later be used to
reproduce the same results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;rand()&quot; is not
cryptographically secure. You should not rely on it in
security-sensitive situations. As of this writing, a number
of third-party CPAN modules offer random <br>
number generators intended by their authors to be
cryptographically secure, including: Data::Entropy,
Crypt::Random, Math::Random::Secure, and
Math::TrulyRandom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat FILEHANDLE <br>
stat EXPR <br>
stat DIRHANDLE <br>
stat <br>
Returns a 13-element list giving the status info for a file,
either the file opened via FILEHANDLE or DIRHANDLE, or named
by EXPR. If EXPR is omitted, it stats $_ (not <br>
&quot;_&quot;!). Returns the empty list if &quot;stat&quot;
fails. Typically used as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,

$atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks) <br>
= stat($filename);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(*) Not all fields are supported
on all filesystem types. Notably, the ctime field is
non-portable. In particular, you cannot expect it to be a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;stat&quot; is passed
the special filehandle consisting of an underline, no stat
is done, but the current contents of the stat structure from
the last &quot;stat&quot;, &quot;lstat&quot;, or <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (-x $file &amp;&amp; (($d) =
stat(_)) &amp;&amp; $d &lt; 0) { <br>
print &quot;$file is executable NFS file0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This works on machines only for
which the device number is negative under NFS.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the mode contains both
the file type and its permissions, you should mask off the
file type portion and (s)printf using a &quot;%o&quot; if
you want to see the real <br>

the string to be searched; you probably want to compare run
<br>
times with and without it to see which is faster. Those
loops that scan for many short constant strings (including
the constant parts of more complex patterns) will benefit
<br>
most. (The way &quot;study&quot; works is this: a linked
list of every character in the string to be searched is
made, so we know, for example, where all the &rsquo;k&rsquo;
characters are. From <br>
each search string, the rarest character is selected, based
on some static frequency tables constructed from some C
programs and English text. Only those places that contain
<br>
this &quot;rarest&quot; character are examined.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, here is a loop that
inserts index producing entries before any line containing a
certain pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
study; o <br>
print &quot;.IX foo0 if /oa <br>
print &quot;.IX bar0 if /r l u <br>
print &quot;.IX blurfl0 if /r f l <br>
# ... <br>
print; <br>
} o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In searching for &quot;/o <br>
cases. The only question is whether it saves you more time
than it took to build the linked list in the first
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you have to look
for strings that you don&rsquo;t know till runtime, you can
build an entire loop as a string and &quot;eval&quot; that
to avoid recompiling all your patterns <br>
all the time. Together with undefining $/ to input entire
files as one record, this can be quite fast, often faster
than specialized programs like fgrep(1). The following <br>
scans a list of files (@files) for a list of words (@words),
and prints out the names of those files that contain a
match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$search = &rsquo;while
(&lt;&gt;) { study;&rsquo;; <br>
foreach $word (@words) { <br>
$search .= &quot;++een{RGV} if /\b$word\b/;0; <br>
} <br>
$search .= &quot;}&quot;; <br>
@ARGV = @files; <br>
undef $/; <br>
eval $search; # this screams <br>
$/ = &quot;0; # put back to normal input delimiter <br>
foreach $file (sort keys(%seen)) { <br>
print $file, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub NAME BLOCK <br>
sub NAME (PROTO) BLOCK <br>
sub NAME : ATTRS BLOCK <br>
sub NAME (PROTO) : ATTRS BLOCK <br>
This is subroutine definition, not a real function per se.
Without a BLOCK it&rsquo;s just a forward declaration.
Without a NAME, it&rsquo;s an anonymous function
declaration, so does <br>
return a value: the CODE ref of the closure just
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlsub and perlref for
details about subroutines and references; see attributes and
Attribute::Handlers for more information about
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__SUB__ <br>
A special token that returns the a reference to the current
subroutine, or &quot;undef&quot; outside of a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This token is only available
under &quot;use v5.16&quot; or the &quot;current_sub&quot;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">substr
EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH,REPLACEMENT <br>
substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH <br>
substr EXPR,OFFSET <br>
Extracts a substring out of EXPR and returns it. First
character is at offset zero. If OFFSET is negative, starts
that far back from the end of the string. If LENGTH is <br>
omitted, returns everything through the end of the string.
If LENGTH is negative, leaves that many characters off the
end of the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $s = &quot;The black cat
climbed the green tree&quot;; <br>
my $color = substr $s, 4, 5; # black <br>
my $middle = substr $s, 4, -11; # black cat climbed the <br>
my $end = substr $s, 14; # climbed the green tree <br>
my $tail = substr $s, -4; # tree <br>
my $z = substr $s, -4, 2; # tr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the substr()
function as an lvalue, in which case EXPR must itself be an
lvalue. If you assign something shorter than LENGTH, the
string will shrink, and if you <br>
assign something longer than LENGTH, the string will grow to
accommodate it. To keep the string the same length, you may
need to pad or chop your value using
&quot;sprintf&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If OFFSET and LENGTH specify a
substring that is partly outside the string, only the part
within the string is returned. If the substring is beyond
either end of the string, <br>
substr() returns the undefined value and produces a warning.
When used as an lvalue, specifying a substring that is
entirely outside the string raises an exception.
Here&rsquo;s <br>
an example showing the behavior for boundary cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $name = &rsquo;fred&rsquo;;
<br>
substr($name, 4) = &rsquo;dy&rsquo;; # $name is now
&rsquo;freddy&rsquo; <br>
my $null = substr $name, 6, 2; # returns &quot;&quot; (no
warning) <br>
my $oops = substr $name, 7; # returns undef, with warning
<br>
substr($name, 7) = &rsquo;gap&rsquo;; # raises an
exception</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative to using substr()
as an lvalue is to specify the replacement string as the 4th
argument. This allows you to replace parts of the EXPR and
return what was <br>
there before in one operation, just as you can with
splice().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $s = &quot;The black cat
climbed the green tree&quot;; <br>
my $z = substr $s, 14, 7, &quot;jumped from&quot;; # climbed
<br>
# $s is now &quot;The black cat jumped from the green
tree&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the lvalue returned by
the three-argument version of substr() acts as a
&rsquo;magic bullet&rsquo;; each time it is assigned to, it
remembers which part of the original string <br>
is being modified; for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$x = &rsquo;1234&rsquo;; <br>
for (substr($x,1,2)) { <br>
$_ = &rsquo;a&rsquo;; print $x,&quot;0; # prints 1a4 <br>
$_ = &rsquo;xyz&rsquo;; print $x,&quot;0; # prints 1xyz4
<br>
$x = &rsquo;56789&rsquo;; <br>
$_ = &rsquo;pq&rsquo;; print $x,&quot;0; # prints 5pq9 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With negative offsets, it
remembers its position from the end of the string when the
target string is modified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$x = &rsquo;1234&rsquo;; <br>
for (substr($x, -3, 2)) { <br>
$_ = &rsquo;a&rsquo;; print $x,&quot;0; # prints 1a4, as
above <br>
$x = &rsquo;abcdefg&rsquo;; <br>
print $_,&quot;0; # prints f <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to Perl version 5.10, the
result of using an lvalue multiple times was unspecified.
Prior to 5.16, the result with negative offsets was
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink OLDFILE,NEWFILE <br>
Creates a new filename symbolically linked to the old
filename. Returns 1 for success, 0 otherwise. On systems
that don&rsquo;t support symbolic links, raises an
exception. To <br>
check for that, use eval:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$symlink_exists = eval {
symlink(&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;); 1 };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syscall NUMBER, LIST <br>
Calls the system call specified as the first element of the
list, passing the remaining elements as arguments to the
system call. If unimplemented, raises an exception. The <br>
arguments are interpreted as follows: if a given argument is
numeric, the argument is passed as an int. If not, the
pointer to the string value is passed. You are <br>
responsible to make sure a string is pre-extended long
enough to receive any result that might be written into a
string. You can&rsquo;t use a string literal (or other
read-only <br>
string) as an argument to &quot;syscall&quot; because Perl
has to assume that any string pointer might be written
through. If your integer arguments are not literals and have
never <br>
been interpreted in a numeric context, you may need to add 0
to them to force them to look like numbers. This emulates
the &quot;syswrite&quot; function (or vice versa):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&rsquo;syscall.ph&rsquo;; # may need to run h2ph <br>
$s = &quot;hi there0; <br>
syscall(&amp;SYS_write, fileno(STDOUT), $s, length $s);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Perl supports passing
of up to only 14 arguments to your syscall, which in
practice should (usually) suffice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syscall returns whatever value
returned by the system call it calls. If the system call
fails, &quot;syscall&quot; returns &quot;-1&quot; and sets
$! (errno). Note that some system calls can <br>
legitimately return &quot;-1&quot;. The proper way to handle
such calls is to assign &quot;$!=0&quot; before the call,
then check the value of $! if &quot;syscall&quot; returns
&quot;-1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s a problem with
&quot;syscall(&amp;SYS_pipe)&quot;: it returns the file
number of the read end of the pipe it creates, but there is
no way to retrieve the file number of the other <br>
end. You can avoid this problem by using &quot;pipe&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysopen FILEHANDLE,FILENAME,MODE
<br>
sysopen FILEHANDLE,FILENAME,MODE,PERMS <br>
Opens the file whose filename is given by FILENAME, and
associates it with FILEHANDLE. If FILEHANDLE is an
expression, its value is used as the real filehandle wanted;
an <br>
undefined scalar will be suitably autovivified. This
function calls the underlying operating system&rsquo;s
open(2) function with the parameters FILENAME, MODE, and
PERMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible values and flag
bits of the MODE parameter are system-dependent; they are
available via the standard module &quot;Fcntl&quot;. See the
documentation of your operating <br>
system&rsquo;s open(2) syscall to see which values and flag
bits are available. You may combine several flags using the
&quot;|&quot;-operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the most common values
are &quot;O_RDONLY&quot; for opening the file in read-only
mode, &quot;O_WRONLY&quot; for opening the file in
write-only mode, and &quot;O_RDWR&quot; for opening the file
in <br>
read-write mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For historical reasons, some
values work on almost every system supported by Perl: 0
means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2 means read/write.
We know that these values <br>
do not work under OS/390 &amp; VM/ESA Unix and on the
Macintosh; you probably don&rsquo;t want to use them in new
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file named by FILENAME
does not exist and the &quot;open&quot; call creates it
(typically because MODE includes the &quot;O_CREAT&quot;
flag), then the value of PERMS specifies the <br>
permissions of the newly created file. If you omit the PERMS
argument to &quot;sysopen&quot;, Perl uses the octal value
0666. These permission values need to be in octal, and are
<br>
modified by your process&rsquo;s current
&quot;umask&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many systems the
&quot;O_EXCL&quot; flag is available for opening files in
exclusive mode. This is not locking: exclusiveness means
here that if the file already exists, sysopen() <br>
fails. &quot;O_EXCL&quot; may not work on network
filesystems, and has no effect unless the
&quot;O_CREAT&quot; flag is set as well. Setting
&quot;O_CREAT|O_EXCL&quot; prevents the file from being <br>
opened if it is a symbolic link. It does not protect against
symbolic links in the file&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you may want to
truncate an already-existing file. This can be done using
the &quot;O_TRUNC&quot; flag. The behavior of
&quot;O_TRUNC&quot; with &quot;O_RDONLY&quot; is
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should seldom if ever use
0644 as argument to &quot;sysopen&quot;, because that takes
away the user&rsquo;s option to have a more permissive
umask. Better to omit it. See the <br>
perlfunc(1) entry on &quot;umask&quot; for more on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;sysopen&quot;
depends on the fdopen() C library function. On many Unix
systems, fdopen() is known to fail when file descriptors
exceed a certain value, typically 255. <br>
If you need more file descriptors than that, consider
rebuilding Perl to use the &quot;sfio&quot; library, or
perhaps using the POSIX::open() function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlopentut for a kinder,
gentler explanation of opening files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysread
FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET <br>
sysread FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH <br>
Attempts to read LENGTH bytes of data into variable SCALAR
from the specified FILEHANDLE, using the read(2). It
bypasses buffered IO, so mixing this with other kinds of
<br>
reads, &quot;print&quot;, &quot;write&quot;,
&quot;seek&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;, or &quot;eof&quot; can
cause confusion because the perlio or stdio layers usually
buffers data. Returns the number of bytes actually read, 0
<br>
at end of file, or undef if there was an error (in the
latter case $! is also set). SCALAR will be grown or shrunk
so that the last byte actually read is the last byte of <br>
the scalar after the read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An OFFSET may be specified to
place the read data at some place in the string other than
the beginning. A negative OFFSET specifies placement at that
many characters <br>
counting backwards from the end of the string. A positive
OFFSET greater than the length of SCALAR results in the
string being padded to the required size with &quot; &quot;
bytes <br>
before the result of the read is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no syseof() function,
which is ok, since eof() doesn&rsquo;t work well on device
files (like ttys) anyway. Use sysread() and check for a
return value for 0 to decide <br>
whether you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the filehandle has
been marked as &quot;:utf8&quot; Unicode characters are read
instead of bytes (the LENGTH, OFFSET, and the return value
of sysread() are in Unicode <br>
characters). The &quot;:encoding(...)&quot; layer implicitly
introduces the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer. See
&quot;binmode&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, and the
&quot;open&quot; pragma, open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysseek
FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE <br>
Sets FILEHANDLE&rsquo;s system position in bytes using
lseek(2). FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives
the name of the filehandle. The values for WHENCE are 0 to
set <br>
the new position to POSITION; 1 to set the it to the current
position plus POSITION; and 2 to set it to EOF plus
POSITION, typically negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the in bytes: even if the
filehandle has been set to operate on characters (for
example by using the &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; I/O layer),
tell() will return byte offsets, not <br>
character offsets (because implementing that would render
sysseek() unacceptably slow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysseek() bypasses normal
buffered IO, so mixing it with reads other than
&quot;sysread&quot; (for example &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; or
read()) &quot;print&quot;, &quot;write&quot;,
&quot;seek&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;, or &quot;eof&quot; may
cause <br>
confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For WHENCE, you may also use the
constants &quot;SEEK_SET&quot;, &quot;SEEK_CUR&quot;, and
&quot;SEEK_END&quot; (start of the file, current position,
end of the file) from the Fcntl module. Use of the <br>
constants is also more portable than relying on 0, 1, and 2.
For example to define a &quot;systell&quot; function:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Fcntl
&rsquo;SEEK_CUR&rsquo;; <br>
sub systell { sysseek($_[0], 0, SEEK_CUR) }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns the new position, or the
undefined value on failure. A position of zero is returned
as the string &quot;0 but true&quot;; thus
&quot;sysseek&quot; returns true on success and false on
<br>
failure, yet you can still easily determine the new
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system LIST <br>
system PROGRAM LIST <br>
Does exactly the same thing as &quot;exec LIST&quot;, except
that a fork is done first and the parent process waits for
the child process to exit. Note that argument processing
varies <br>
depending on the number of arguments. If there is more than
one argument in LIST, or if LIST is an array with more than
one value, starts the program given by the first <br>
element of the list with arguments given by the rest of the
list. If there is only one scalar argument, the argument is
checked for shell metacharacters, and if there are <br>
any, the entire argument is passed to the system&rsquo;s
command shell for parsing (this is &quot;/bin/sh -c&quot; on
Unix platforms, but varies on other platforms). If there are
no shell <br>
metacharacters in the argument, it is split into words and
passed directly to &quot;execvp&quot;, which is more
efficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl will
attempt to flush all files opened for output before any
operation that may do a fork, but this may not be supported
on some platforms (see <br>
perlport). To be safe, you may need to set $| ($AUTOFLUSH in
English) or call the &quot;autoflush()&quot; method of
&quot;IO::Handle&quot; on any open handles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value is the exit
status of the program as returned by the &quot;wait&quot;
call. To get the actual exit value, shift right by eight
(see below). See also &quot;exec&quot;. This is <br>
not what you want to use to capture the output from a
command; for that you should use merely backticks or
&quot;qx//&quot;, as described in
&quot;&lsquo;STRING&lsquo;&quot; in perlop. Return value of
-1 <br>
indicates a failure to start the program or an error of the
wait(2) system call (inspect $! for the reason).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;d like to make
&quot;system&quot; (and many other bits of Perl) die on
error, have a look at the autodie pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like &quot;exec&quot;,
&quot;system&quot; allows you to lie to a program about its
name if you use the &quot;system PROGRAM LIST&quot; syntax.
Again, see &quot;exec&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since &quot;SIGINT&quot; and
&quot;SIGQUIT&quot; are ignored during the execution of
&quot;system&quot;, if you expect your program to terminate
on receipt of these signals you will need to arrange to do
<br>
so yourself based on the return value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@args = (&quot;command&quot;,
&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;); <br>
system(@args) == 0 <br>
or die &quot;system @args failed: $?&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;d like to manually
inspect &quot;system&quot;&rsquo;s failure, you can check
all possible failure modes by inspecting $? like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($? == -1) { <br>
print &quot;failed to execute: $!0; <br>
} <br>
elsif ($? &amp; 127) { <br>
printf &quot;child died with signal %d, %s coredump0, <br>
($? &amp; 127), ($? &amp; 128) ? &rsquo;with&rsquo; :
&rsquo;without&rsquo;; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
printf &quot;child exited with value %d0, $? &gt;&gt; 8;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you may inspect
the value of &quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot; with the
&quot;W*()&quot; calls from the POSIX module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;system&quot;&rsquo;s
arguments are executed indirectly by the shell, results and
return codes are subject to its quirks. See
&quot;&lsquo;STRING&lsquo;&quot; in perlop and
&quot;exec&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since &quot;system&quot; does a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syswrite
FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET <br>
syswrite FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH <br>
syswrite FILEHANDLE,SCALAR <br>
Attempts to write LENGTH bytes of data from variable SCALAR
to the specified FILEHANDLE, using write(2). If LENGTH is
not specified, writes whole SCALAR. It bypasses <br>
buffered IO, so mixing this with reads (other than
sysread()), &quot;print&quot;, &quot;write&quot;,
&quot;seek&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;, or &quot;eof&quot; may
cause confusion because the perlio and stdio layers usually
<br>
buffer data. Returns the number of bytes actually written,
or &quot;undef&quot; if there was an error (in this case the
errno variable $! is also set). If the LENGTH is greater
than <br>
the data available in the SCALAR after the OFFSET, only as
much data as is available will be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An OFFSET may be specified to
write the data from some part of the string other than the
beginning. A negative OFFSET specifies writing that many
characters counting <br>
backwards from the end of the string. If SCALAR is of length
zero, you can only use an OFFSET of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: If the filehandle is
marked &quot;:utf8&quot;, Unicode characters encoded in
UTF-8 are written instead of bytes, and the LENGTH, OFFSET,
and return value of syswrite() are in <br>
(UTF8-encoded Unicode) characters. The
&quot;:encoding(...)&quot; layer implicitly introduces the
&quot;:utf8&quot; layer. Alternately, if the handle is not
marked with an encoding but you <br>
attempt to write characters with code points over 255,
raises an exception. See &quot;binmode&quot;,
&quot;open&quot;, and the &quot;open&quot; pragma, open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tell FILEHANDLE <br>
tell <br>
Returns the current position in bytes for FILEHANDLE, or -1
on error. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives
the name of the actual filehandle. If FILEHANDLE is <br>
omitted, assumes the file last read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the in bytes: even if the
filehandle has been set to operate on characters (for
example by using the &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; open
layer), tell() will return byte offsets, not <br>
character offsets (because that would render seek() and
tell() rather slow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The return value of tell() for
the standard streams like the STDIN depends on the operating
system: it may return -1 or something else. tell() on pipes,
fifos, and sockets <br>
usually returns -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no &quot;systell&quot;
function. Use &quot;sysseek(FH, 0, 1)&quot; for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use tell() (or other
buffered I/O operations) on a filehandle that has been
manipulated by sysread(), syswrite(), or sysseek(). Those
functions ignore the buffering, <br>
while tell() does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telldir DIRHANDLE <br>
Returns the current position of the &quot;readdir&quot;
routines on DIRHANDLE. Value may be given to
&quot;seekdir&quot; to access a particular location in a
directory. &quot;telldir&quot; has the same <br>
caveats about possible directory compaction as the
corresponding system library routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tie VARIABLE,CLASSNAME,LIST <br>
This function binds a variable to a package class that will
provide the implementation for the variable. VARIABLE is the
name of the variable to be enchanted. CLASSNAME is <br>
the name of a class implementing objects of correct type.
Any additional arguments are passed to the &quot;new&quot;
method of the class (meaning &quot;TIESCALAR&quot;,
&quot;TIEHANDLE&quot;, &quot;TIEARRAY&quot;, <br>
or &quot;TIEHASH&quot;). Typically these are arguments such
as might be passed to the &quot;dbm_open()&quot; function of
C. The object returned by the &quot;new&quot; method is also
returned by the <br>
&quot;tie&quot; function, which would be useful if you want
to access other methods in CLASSNAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that functions such as
&quot;keys&quot; and &quot;values&quot; may return huge
lists when used on large objects, like DBM files. You may
prefer to use the &quot;each&quot; function to iterate over

truncate EXPR,LENGTH <br>
Truncates the file opened on FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR,

uc Returns an uppercased version of EXPR. This is the

mapping on <br>
initial letters. See &quot;ucfirst&quot; for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask EXPR <br>
umask <br>
Sets the umask for the process to EXPR and returns the
previous value. If EXPR is omitted, merely returns the
current umask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix permission
&quot;rwxr-x---&quot; is represented as three sets of three
bits, or three octal digits: 0750 (the leading 0 indicates
octal and isn&rsquo;t one of the digits). The <br>
&quot;umask&quot; value is such a number representing
disabled permissions bits. The permission (or
&quot;mode&quot;) values you pass &quot;mkdir&quot; or
&quot;sysopen&quot; are modified by your umask, so even if
<br>
you tell &quot;sysopen&quot; to create a file with
permissions 0777, if your umask is 0022, then the file will
actually be created with permissions 0755. If your
&quot;umask&quot; were 0027 <br>
(group can&rsquo;t write; others can&rsquo;t read, write, or
execute), then passing &quot;sysopen&quot; 0666 would create
a file with mode 0640 (because &quot;0666 &amp;~ 027&quot;
is 0640).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s some advice: supply
a creation mode of 0666 for regular files (in
&quot;sysopen&quot;) and one of 0777 for directories (in
&quot;mkdir&quot;) and executable files. This gives users
the <br>
freedom of choice: if they want protected files, they might
choose process umasks of 022, 027, or even the particularly
antisocial mask of 077. Programs should rarely if <br>
ever make policy decisions better left to the user. The
exception to this is when writing files that should be kept
private: mail files, web browser cookies, .rhosts files,
<br>
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If umask(2) is not implemented
on your system and you are trying to restrict access for
yourself (i.e., &quot;(EXPR &amp; 0700) &gt; 0&quot;),
raises an exception. If umask(2) is not <br>
implemented and you are not trying to restrict access for
yourself, returns &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that a umask is a
number, usually given in octal; it is not a string of octal
digits. See also &quot;oct&quot;, if all you have is a
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;umask&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undef EXPR <br>
undef <br>
Undefines the value of EXPR, which must be an lvalue. Use
only on a scalar value, an array (using &quot;@&quot;), a
hash (using &quot;%&quot;), a subroutine (using
&quot;&amp;&quot;), or a typeglob (using <br>
&quot;*&quot;). Saying &quot;undef $hash{$key}&quot; will
probably not do what you expect on most predefined variables
or DBM list values, so don&rsquo;t do that; see
&quot;delete&quot;. Always returns the <br>
undefined value. You can omit the EXPR, in which case
nothing is undefined, but you still get an undefined value
that you could, for instance, return from a subroutine, <br>
assign to a variable, or pass as a parameter. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undef $foo; <br>
undef $bar{&rsquo;blurfl&rsquo;}; # Compare to: delete
$bar{&rsquo;blurfl&rsquo;}; <br>
undef @ary; <br>
undef %hash; <br>
undef &amp;mysub; <br>
undef *xyz; # destroys $xyz, @xyz, %xyz, &amp;xyz, etc. <br>
return (wantarray ? (undef, $errmsg) : undef) if
$they_blew_it; <br>
select undef, undef, undef, 0.25; <br>
($a, $b, undef, $c) = &amp;foo; # Ignore third value
returned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is a unary
operator, not a list operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlink LIST <br>
unlink <br>
Deletes a list of files. On success, it returns the number
of files it successfully deleted. On failure, it returns
false and sets $! (errno):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $unlinked = unlink
&rsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;c&rsquo;; <br>
unlink @goners; <br>
unlink glob &quot;*.bak&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On error, &quot;unlink&quot;
will not tell you which files it could not remove. If you
want to know which files you could not remove, try them one
at a time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach my $file ( @goners ) {
<br>
unlink $file or warn &quot;Could not unlink $file: $!&quot;;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: &quot;unlink&quot; will
not attempt to delete directories unless you are superuser
and the -U flag is supplied to Perl. Even if these
conditions are met, be warned that <br>
unlinking a directory can inflict damage on your filesystem.
Finally, using &quot;unlink&quot; on directories is not
supported on many operating systems. Use &quot;rmdir&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LIST is omitted,
&quot;unlink&quot; uses $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unpack TEMPLATE,EXPR <br>
unpack TEMPLATE <br>
&quot;unpack&quot; does the reverse of &quot;pack&quot;: it
takes a string and expands it out into a list of values. (In
scalar context, it returns merely the first value
produced.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EXPR is omitted, unpacks the
$_ string. See perlpacktut for an introduction to this
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string is broken into chunks
described by the TEMPLATE. Each chunk is converted
separately to a value. Typically, either the string is a
result of &quot;pack&quot;, or the <br>
characters of the string represent a C structure of some
kind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TEMPLATE has the same format
as in the &quot;pack&quot; function. Here&rsquo;s a
subroutine that does substring:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub substr { <br>
my($what,$where,$howmuch) = @_; <br>
unpack(&quot;x$where a$howmuch&quot;, $what); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then there&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub ordinal {
unpack(&quot;W&quot;,$_[0]); } # same as ord()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to fields allowed in
pack(), you may prefix a field with a %&lt;number&gt; to
indicate that you want a &lt;number&gt;-bit checksum of the
items instead of the items <br>
themselves. Default is a 16-bit checksum. Checksum is
calculated by summing numeric values of expanded values (for
string fields the sum of &quot;ord($char)&quot; is taken;
for bit <br>
fields the sum of zeroes and ones).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following
computes the same number as the System V sum program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$checksum = do { <br>
local $/; # slurp! <br>
unpack(&quot;%32W*&quot;,&lt;&gt;) % 65535; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following efficiently counts
the number of set bits in a bit vector:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$setbits =
unpack(&quot;%32b*&quot;, $selectmask);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;p&quot; and
&quot;P&quot; formats should be used with care. Since Perl
has no way of checking whether the value passed to
&quot;unpack()&quot; corresponds to a valid memory location,
passing a <br>
pointer value that&rsquo;s not known to be valid is likely
to have disastrous consequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are more pack codes or
if the repeat count of a field or a group is larger than
what the remainder of the input string allows, the result is
not well defined: the <br>
repeat count may be decreased, or &quot;unpack()&quot; may
produce empty strings or zeros, or it may raise an
exception. If the input string is longer than one described
by the <br>
TEMPLATE, the remainder of that input string is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;pack&quot; for more
examples and notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unshift ARRAY,LIST <br>
unshift EXPR,LIST <br>
Does the opposite of a &quot;shift&quot;. Or the opposite of
a &quot;push&quot;, depending on how you look at it.
Prepends list to the front of the array and returns the new
number of elements <br>
in the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unshift(@ARGV, &rsquo;-e&rsquo;)
unless $ARGV[0] =~ /^-/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the LIST is prepended
whole, not one element at a time, so the prepended elements
stay in the same order. Use &quot;reverse&quot; to do the
reverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,
&quot;unshift&quot; can take a scalar EXPR, which must hold
a reference to an unblessed array. The argument will be
dereferenced automatically. This aspect <br>
of &quot;unshift&quot; is considered highly experimental.
The exact behaviour may change in a future version of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be
users of your code who are running earlier versions of Perl
with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of thing at the
top of your file to <br>
signal that your code will work only on Perls of a recent
vintage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.014; # so push/pop/etc
work on scalars (experimental)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">untie VARIABLE <br>
Breaks the binding between a variable and a package. (See
tie.) Has no effect if the variable is not tied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Module VERSION LIST <br>
use Module VERSION <br>
use Module LIST <br>
use Module <br>
use VERSION <br>
Imports some semantics into the current package from the
named module, generally by aliasing certain subroutine or
variable names into your package. It is exactly equivalent
<br>
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require Module;
Module-&gt;import( LIST ); }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that Module must be a
bareword. The importation can be made conditional; see
if.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the peculiar &quot;use
VERSION&quot; form, VERSION may be either a positive decimal
fraction such as 5.006, which will be compared to $], or a
v-string of the form v5.6.1, which <br>
will be compared to $^V (aka $PERL_VERSION). An exception is
raised if VERSION is greater than the version of the current
Perl interpreter; Perl will not attempt to parse <br>
the rest of the file. Compare with &quot;require&quot;,
which can do a similar check at run time. Symmetrically,
&quot;no VERSION&quot; allows you to specify that you want a
version of Perl <br>
older than the specified one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying VERSION as a literal
of the form v5.6.1 should generally be avoided, because it
leads to misleading error messages under earlier versions of
Perl (that is, prior <br>
to 5.6.0) that do not support this syntax. The equivalent
numeric version should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use v5.6.1; # compile time
version check <br>
use 5.6.1; # ditto <br>
use 5.006_001; # ditto; preferred for backwards
compatibility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is often useful if you need
to check the current Perl version before &quot;use&quot;ing
library modules that won&rsquo;t work with older versions of
Perl. (We try not to do this more <br>
than we have to.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use VERSION&quot; also
enables all features available in the requested version as
defined by the &quot;feature&quot; pragma, disabling any
features not in the requested version&rsquo;s feature <br>
bundle. See feature. Similarly, if the specified Perl
version is greater than or equal to 5.11.0, strictures are
enabled lexically as with &quot;use strict&quot;. Any
explicit use <br>
of &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;no strict&quot; overrides
&quot;use VERSION&quot;, even if it comes before it. In both
cases, the feature.pm and strict.pm files are not actually
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;BEGIN&quot; forces the
&quot;require&quot; and &quot;import&quot; to happen at
compile time. The &quot;require&quot; makes sure the module
is loaded into memory if it hasn&rsquo;t been yet. The
&quot;import&quot; is <br>
not a builtin; it&rsquo;s just an ordinary static method
call into the &quot;Module&quot; package to tell the module
to import the list of features back into the current
package. The module <br>
can implement its &quot;import&quot; method any way it
likes, though most modules just choose to derive their
&quot;import&quot; method via inheritance from the
&quot;Exporter&quot; class that is defined <br>
in the &quot;Exporter&quot; module. See Exporter. If no
&quot;import&quot; method can be found then the call is
skipped, even if there is an AUTOLOAD method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want to call the
package&rsquo;s &quot;import&quot; method (for instance, to
stop your namespace from being altered), explicitly supply
the empty list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Module ();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is exactly equivalent
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require Module }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the VERSION argument is
present between Module and LIST, then the &quot;use&quot;
will call the VERSION method in class Module with the given
version as an argument. The default <br>
VERSION method, inherited from the UNIVERSAL class, croaks
if the given version is larger than the value of the
variable $Module::VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again, there is a distinction
between omitting LIST (&quot;import&quot; called with no
arguments) and an explicit empty LIST &quot;()&quot;
(&quot;import&quot; not called). Note that there is no comma
<br>
after VERSION!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because this is a wide-open
interface, pragmas (compiler directives) are also
implemented this way. Currently implemented pragmas are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use constant; <br>
use diagnostics; <br>
use integer; <br>
use sigtrap qw(SEGV BUS); <br>
use strict qw(subs vars refs); <br>
use subs qw(afunc blurfl); <br>
use warnings qw(all); <br>
use sort qw(stable _quicksort _mergesort);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of these pseudo-modules
import semantics into the current block scope (like
&quot;strict&quot; or &quot;integer&quot;, unlike ordinary
modules, which import symbols into the current package <br>
(which are effective through the end of the file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because &quot;use&quot; takes
effect at compile time, it doesn&rsquo;t respect the
ordinary flow control of the code being compiled. In
particular, putting a &quot;use&quot; inside the false
branch <br>
of a conditional doesn&rsquo;t prevent it from being
processed. If a module or pragma only needs to be loaded
conditionally, this can be done using the if pragma:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use if $] &lt; 5.008,
&quot;utf8&quot;; <br>
use if WANT_WARNINGS, warnings =&gt; qw(all);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s a corresponding
&quot;no&quot; declaration that unimports meanings imported
by &quot;use&quot;, i.e., it calls &quot;unimport Module
LIST&quot; instead of &quot;import&quot;. It behaves just as
&quot;import&quot; <br>
does with VERSION, an omitted or empty LIST, or no unimport
method being found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no integer; <br>
no strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;; <br>
no warnings;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken when using
the &quot;no VERSION&quot; form of &quot;no&quot;. It is
only meant to be used to assert that the running Perl is of
a earlier version than its argument and not <br>
to undo the feature-enabling side effects of &quot;use
VERSION&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlmodlib for a list of
standard modules and pragmas. See perlrun for the
&quot;-M&quot; and &quot;-m&quot; command-line options to
Perl that give &quot;use&quot; functionality from the
command- <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utime LIST <br>
Changes the access and modification times on each file of a
list of files. The first two elements of the list must be
the NUMERIC access and modification times, in that <br>
order. Returns the number of files successfully changed. The
inode change time of each file is set to the current time.
For example, this code has the same effect as the <br>
Unix touch(1) command when the files already exist and
belong to the user running the program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
$atime = $mtime = time; <br>
utime $atime, $mtime, @ARGV;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Perl 5.7.2, if the first
two elements of the list are &quot;undef&quot;, the utime(2)
syscall from your C library is called with a null second
argument. On most systems, this <br>
will set the file&rsquo;s access and modification times to
the current time (i.e., equivalent to the example above) and
will work even on files you don&rsquo;t own provided you
have <br>
write permission:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for $file (@ARGV) { <br>
utime(undef, undef, $file) <br>
|| warn &quot;couldn&rsquo;t touch $file: $!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under NFS this will use the time
of the NFS server, not the time of the local machine. If
there is a time synchronization problem, the NFS server and
local machine will have <br>
different times. The Unix touch(1) command will in fact
normally use this form instead of the one shown in the first
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing only one of the first
two elements as &quot;undef&quot; is equivalent to passing a
0 and will not have the effect described when both are
&quot;undef&quot;. This also triggers an <br>
uninitialized warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support
futimes(2), you may pass filehandles among the files. On
systems that don&rsquo;t support futimes(2), passing
filehandles raises an exception. Filehandles <br>
must be passed as globs or glob references to be recognized;
barewords are considered filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">values HASH <br>
values ARRAY <br>
values EXPR <br>
In list context, returns a list consisting of all the values
of the named hash. In Perl 5.12 or later only, will also
return a list of the values of an array; prior to that <br>
release, attempting to use an array argument will produce a
syntax error. In scalar context, returns the number of
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When called on a hash, the
values are returned in an apparently random order. The
actual random order is subject to change in future versions
of Perl, but it is guaranteed <br>
to be the same order as either the &quot;keys&quot; or
&quot;each&quot; function would produce on the same
(unmodified) hash. Since Perl 5.8.1 the ordering is
different even between different <br>
runs of Perl for security reasons (see &quot;Algorithmic
Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a side effect, calling
values() resets the HASH or ARRAY&rsquo;s internal iterator,
see &quot;each&quot;. (In particular, calling values() in
void context resets the iterator with no <br>
other overhead. Apart from resetting the iterator,
&quot;values @array&quot; in list context is the same as
plain @array. (We recommend that you use void context
&quot;keys @array&quot; for <br>
this, but reasoned that taking &quot;values @array&quot; out
would require more documentation than leaving it in.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the values are not
copied, which means modifying them will modify the contents
of the hash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14,
&quot;values&quot; can take a scalar EXPR, which must hold a
reference to an unblessed hash or array. The argument will
be dereferenced automatically. This <br>
aspect of &quot;values&quot; is considered highly
experimental. The exact behaviour may change in a future
version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (values $hashref) { ... }
<br>
for (values $obj-&gt;get_arrayref) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid confusing would-be
users of your code who are running earlier versions of Perl
with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of thing at the
top of your file to <br>
signal that your code will work only on Perls of a recent
vintage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.012; # so keys/values/each
work on arrays <br>
use 5.014; # so keys/values/each work on scalars
(experimental)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;keys&quot;,
&quot;each&quot;, and &quot;sort&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS <br>
Treats the string in EXPR as a bit vector made up of
elements of width BITS and returns the value of the element
specified by OFFSET as an unsigned integer. BITS therefore
<br>
specifies the number of bits that are reserved for each
element in the bit vector. This must be a power of two from
1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If BITS is 8,
&quot;elements&quot; coincide with bytes of the input
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If BITS is 16 or more, bytes of
the input string are grouped into chunks of size BITS/8, and
each group is converted to a number as with pack()/unpack()
with big-endian <br>
formats &quot;n&quot;/&quot;N&quot; (and analogously for
BITS==64). See &quot;pack&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If bits is 4 or less, the string
is broken into bytes, then the bits of each byte are broken
into 8/BITS groups. Bits of a byte are numbered in a
little-endian-ish way, as <br>
in 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80. For
example, breaking the single input byte
&quot;chr(0x36)&quot; into two groups gives a list
&quot;(0x6, 0x3)&quot;; breaking it into 4 <br>
groups gives &quot;(0x2, 0x1, 0x3, 0x0)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;vec&quot; may also be
assigned to, in which case parentheses are needed to give
the expression the correct precedence as in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vec($image, $max_x * $x + $y, 8)
= 3;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the selected element is
outside the string, the value 0 is returned. If an element
off the end of the string is written to, Perl will first
extend the string with <br>
sufficiently many zero bytes. It is an error to try to write
off the beginning of the string (i.e., negative OFFSET).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the string happens to be
encoded as UTF-8 internally (and thus has the UTF8 flag
set), this is ignored by &quot;vec&quot;, and it operates on
the internal byte string, not the <br>
conceptual character string, even if you only have
characters with values less than 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings created with
&quot;vec&quot; can also be manipulated with the logical
operators &quot;|&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;^&quot;,
and &quot;~&quot;. These operators will assume a bit vector
operation is desired when both <br>
operands are strings. See &quot;Bitwise String
Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following code will build up
an ASCII string saying &rsquo;PerlPerlPerl&rsquo;. The
comments show the string after each step. Note that this
code works in the same way on big- <br>
endian or little-endian machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $foo = &rsquo;&rsquo;; <br>
vec($foo, 0, 32) = 0x5065726C; # &rsquo;Perl&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># $foo eq &quot;Perl&quot; eq
&quot;052C&quot;, 32 bits <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vec($foo, 2, 16) = 0x5065; #

# &rsquo;l&rsquo; is &quot;c&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To transform a bit vector into a
string or list of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s, use these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$bits = unpack(&quot;b*&quot;,
$vector); <br>
@bits = split(//, unpack(&quot;b*&quot;, $vector));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you know the exact length in
bits, it can be used in place of the &quot;*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait <br>
Behaves like wait(2) on your system: it waits for a child
process to terminate and returns the pid of the deceased
process, or &quot;-1&quot; if there are no child processes.
The <br>
status is returned in $? and
&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;. Note that a return value
of &quot;-1&quot; could mean that child processes are being
automatically reaped, as described in <br>
perlipc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use wait in your handler
for $SIG{CHLD} it may accidentally for the child created by
qx() or system(). See perlipc for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;wait&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">waitpid PID,FLAGS <br>
Waits for a particular child process to terminate and
returns the pid of the deceased process, or &quot;-1&quot;
if there is no such child process. On some systems, a value
of 0 <br>
indicates that there are processes still running. The status
is returned in $? and &quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;. If
you say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use POSIX
&quot;:sys_wait_h&quot;; <br>
#... <br>
do { <br>
$kid = waitpid(-1, WNOHANG); <br>
} while $kid &gt; 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then you can do a non-blocking
wait for all pending zombie processes. Non-blocking wait is
available on machines supporting either the waitpid(2) or
wait4(2) syscalls. <br>
However, waiting for a particular pid with FLAGS of 0 is
implemented everywhere. (Perl emulates the system call by
remembering the status values of processes that have <br>
exited but have not been harvested by the Perl script
yet.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on some systems, a
return value of &quot;-1&quot; could mean that child
processes are being automatically reaped. See perlipc for
details, and for other examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability issues:
&quot;waitpid&quot; in perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wantarray <br>
Returns true if the context of the currently executing
subroutine or &quot;eval&quot; is looking for a list value.
Returns false if the context is looking for a scalar.
Returns the <br>
undefined value if the context is looking for no value (void
context).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return unless defined wantarray;
# don&rsquo;t bother doing more <br>
my @a = complex_calculation(); <br>
return wantarray ? @a : &quot;@a&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;wantarray()&quot;&rsquo;s
result is unspecified in the top level of a file, in a
&quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;,
&quot;INIT&quot; or &quot;END&quot; block, or in a
&quot;DESTROY&quot; method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function should have been
named wantlist() instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warn LIST <br>
Prints the value of LIST to STDERR. If the last element of
LIST does not end in a newline, it appends the same
file/line number text as &quot;die&quot; does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output is empty and $@
already contains a value (typically from a previous eval)
that value is used after appending &quot;...caught&quot; to
$@. This is useful for staying <br>
almost, but not entirely similar to &quot;die&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $@ is empty then the string
&quot;Warning: Something&rsquo;s wrong&quot; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No message is printed if there
is a $SIG{__WARN__} handler installed. It is the
handler&rsquo;s responsibility to deal with the message as
it sees fit (like, for instance, <br>
converting it into a &quot;die&quot;). Most handlers must
therefore arrange to actually display the warnings that they
are not prepared to deal with, by calling &quot;warn&quot;
again in the <br>
handler. Note that this is quite safe and will not produce
an endless loop, since &quot;__WARN__&quot; hooks are not
called from inside one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will find this behavior is
slightly different from that of $SIG{__DIE__} handlers
(which don&rsquo;t suppress the error text, but can instead
call &quot;die&quot; again to change it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a &quot;__WARN__&quot;
handler provides a powerful way to silence all warnings
(even the so-called mandatory ones). An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># wipe out *all* compile-time
warnings <br>
BEGIN { $SIG{&rsquo;__WARN__&rsquo;} = sub { warn $_[0] if
$DOWARN } } <br>
my $foo = 10; <br>
my $foo = 20; # no warning about duplicate my $foo, <br>
# but hey, you asked for it! <br>
# no compile-time or run-time warnings before here <br>
$DOWARN = 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># run-time warnings enabled
after here <br>
warn &quot;oo is alive and $foo!&quot;; # does show up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlvar for details on
setting %SIG entries and for more examples. See the Carp
module for other kinds of warnings using its carp() and
cluck() functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write FILEHANDLE <br>
write EXPR <br>
write <br>
Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the
specified FILEHANDLE, using the format associated with that
file. By default the format for a file is the one having
<br>
the same name as the filehandle, but the format for the
current output channel (see the &quot;select&quot; function)
may be set explicitly by assigning the name of the format to
the $~ <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Top of form processing is
handled automatically: if there is insufficient room on the
current page for the formatted record, the page is advanced
by writing a form feed, a <br>
special top-of-page format is used to format the new page
header before the record is written. By default, the
top-of-page format is the name of the filehandle with
&quot;_TOP&quot; <br>
appended. This would be a problem with autovivified
filehandles, but it may be dynamically set to the format of
your choice by assigning the name to the $^ variable while
<br>
that filehandle is selected. The number of lines remaining
on the current page is in variable &quot;$-&quot;, which can
be set to 0 to force a new page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If FILEHANDLE is unspecified,
output goes to the current default output channel, which
starts out as STDOUT but may be changed by the
&quot;select&quot; operator. If the FILEHANDLE is <br>
an EXPR, then the expression is evaluated and the resulting
string is used to look up the name of the FILEHANDLE at run
time. For more on formats, see perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that write is not the
opposite of &quot;read&quot;. Unfortunately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y/// <br>
