<b>Eggdrop</b> is the World's most popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot; it is
  freely distributable under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Eggdrop is a
  feature rich program designed to be easily used and expanded upon by both
  novice and advanced IRC users on a variety of hardware and software platforms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An IRC bot is a program that sits on an IRC channel and performs automated tasks
  while looking just like a normal user on the channel. Some of these functions
  include protecting the channel from abuse, allowing privileged users to gain
  op or voice status, logging channel events, providing information, hosting
  games, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One of the features that makes Eggdrop stand out from other bots is module and
  Tcl scripting support. With scripts and modules, you can make the bot perform
  almost any task you want. They can do anything from preventing floods to
  greeting users and banning advertisers from channels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also link multiple Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet. This can
  allow bots to op each other securely, control floods efficiently, and even
  link channels across multiple IRC networks. It also allows the Eggdrops share
  user lists, ban lists, exempt/invite lists, and ignore lists with other bots
  if userfile sharing is enabled. This allows users to have the same access on
  every bot on your botnet. It also allows the bots to distribute tasks such as
  opping and banning users. See doc/BOTNET for information on setting up a
  botnet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Eggdrop needs a config file to run. For an example, have a look at
  <b>eggdrop.conf</b> which is distributed with Eggdrop.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display a list of command-line options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't background. Normally, Eggdrop will move itself into
      the background when you start it up, meaning you'll get another shell
      prompt, and you can do other things while the bot is running. With -n, you
      won't return to the shell prompt until the bot exits (which won't normally
      happen until it's killed). By default, -n will send all log entries to the
      console.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-nt</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't background, use terminal. This is just like -n,
      except that instead of seeing log entries, your console will simulate a
      DCC chat with the bot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-nc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't background, show channel info. This is just like -n,
      except that instead of seeing log entries, every 10 seconds your screen
      will clear and you will see the current channel status, sort of like
      &quot;top&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create userfile. If you don't have a userfile, this will
      make Eggdrop create one and give owner status to the first person that
      introduces himself or herself to it. You'll need to do this when you first
      set up your bot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show version info, then quit.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SIGTERM</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Depending on die-on-sigterm being set to 0 or 1 in the

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SIGHUP</b></dt>

  open a DCC chat with it, and type: <b>.help</b>
