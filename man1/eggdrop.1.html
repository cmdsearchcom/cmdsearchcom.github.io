<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
eggdrop - an IRC bot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
eggdrop [options] [config-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Eggdrop is the World&rsquo;s most popular Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) bot; it is freely distributable under the GNU
General Public License (GPL). Eggdrop is a feature rich
program <br>
designed to be easily used and expanded upon by both novice
and advanced IRC users on a variety of hardware and software
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An IRC bot is a program that
sits on an IRC channel and performs automated tasks while
looking just like a normal user on the channel. Some of
these functions include protecting <br>
the channel from abuse, allowing privileged users to gain op
or voice status, logging channel events, providing
information, hosting games, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the features that makes
Eggdrop stand out from other bots is module and Tcl
scripting support. With scripts and modules, you can make
the bot perform almost any task you <br>
want. They can do anything from preventing floods to
greeting users and banning advertisers from channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also link multiple
Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet. This can allow bots
to op each other securely, control floods efficiently, and
even link channels across multi&acirc; <br>
ple IRC networks. It also allows the Eggdrops share user
lists, ban lists, exempt/invite lists, and ignore lists with
other bots if userfile sharing is enabled. This allows users
<br>
to have the same access on every bot on your botnet. It also
allows the bots to distribute tasks such as opping and
banning users. See doc/BOTNET for information on setting up
a <br>
botnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eggdrop needs a config file to
run. For an example, have a look at eggdrop.conf which is
distributed with Eggdrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display a list of command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t background.
Normally, Eggdrop will move itself into the background when
you start it up, meaning you&rsquo;ll get another shell
prompt, and you can do other things while <br>
the bot is running. With -n, you won&rsquo;t return to the
shell prompt until the bot exits (which won&rsquo;t normally
happen until it&rsquo;s killed). By default, -n will send
all log <br>
entries to the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nt Don&rsquo;t background, use
terminal. This is just like -n, except that instead of
seeing log entries, your console will simulate a DCC chat
with the bot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nc Don&rsquo;t background, show
channel info. This is just like -n, except that instead of
seeing log entries, every 10 seconds your screen will clear
and you will see the current <br>
channel status, sort of like &quot;top&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Create userfile. If you
don&rsquo;t have a userfile, this will make Eggdrop create
one and give owner status to the first person that
introduces himself or herself to it. You&rsquo;ll <br>
need to do this when you first set up your bot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show version info, then
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGCHLD <br>
This signal is ignored by Eggdrop and can be used to
determine whether it&rsquo;s running or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
Depending on die-on-sigterm being set to 0 or 1 in the
config file, Eggdrop will save its user and channel file
and/or die.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP Depending on
die-on-sighup being set to 0 or 1 in the config file,
Eggdrop will rehash (reload its config file) or die.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
EGG_LANG <br>
This variable can be set to the language in which you want
Eggdrop to speak <br>
to you. It defaults to English, but German, French, Finnish,
and Danish are supported, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EGG_LANGDIR <br>
Specifies the directory where all your language files are
stored. The default is ./language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
tclsh(1), irc(1), ircII(1), ircd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is extensive online
documentation. Once you get the bot running, open a DCC chat
with it, and type: .help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the files in the
doc/ directory provide detailed information about how
Eggdrop works and how to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>

various others. See the files AUTHORS for a list of Eggdrop
