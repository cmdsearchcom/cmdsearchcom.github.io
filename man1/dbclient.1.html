<p>dbclient(1) General Commands Manual dbclient(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dbclient - lightweight SSH client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dbclient [flag arguments] [-p port] [-i id] [-L l:h:p] [-R
l:h:p] [-l user] host [more flags] [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbclient [args]
[user1]@host1[^port1],[user2]@host2[^port2],...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dbclient is a small SSH client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
command <br>
A command to run on the remote host. This will normally be
run by the remote host using the user&rsquo;s shell. The
command begins at the first hyphen argument after the host
<br>
argument. If no command is specified an interactive terminal
will be opened (see -t and -T).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Connect to port on the remote host. Alternatively a port can
be specified as hostname^port. Default is 22.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i idfile <br>
Identity file. Read the identity key from file idfile
(multiple allowed). This file is created with dropbearkey(1)
or converted from OpenSSH with dropbearconvert(1). The <br>
default path ~/.ssh/id_dropbear is used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L
[listenaddress]:listenport:host:port <br>
Local port forwarding. Forward the port listenport on the
local host through the SSH connection to port port on the
host host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R
[listenaddress]:listenport:host:port <br>
Remote port forwarding. Forward the port listenport on the
remote host through the SSH connection to port port on the
host host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
Username. Login as user on the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Allocate a PTY. This is the
default when no command is given, it gives a full
interactive remote session. The main effect is that
keystrokes are sent remotely immediately <br>
as opposed to local line-based editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Don&rsquo;t allocate a PTY.
This is the default a command is given. See -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Don&rsquo;t request a remote
shell or run any commands. Any command arguments are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fork into the background
after authentication. A command argument (or -N) is
required. This is useful when using password
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Allow non-local hosts to
connect to forwarded ports. Applies to -L and -R forwarded
ports, though remote connections to -R forwarded ports may
be limited by the ssh <br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Always accept hostkeys if
they are unknown. If a hostkey mismatch occurs the
connection will abort as normal. If specified a second time
no host key checking is performed <br>
at all, this is usually undesirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Forward agent connections to
the remote host. dbclient will use any OpenSSH-style agent
program if available ($SSH_AUTH_SOCK will be set) for public
key authentication. <br>
Forwarding is only enabled if -A is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W windowsize <br>
Specify the per-channel receive window buffer size.
Increasing this may improve network performance at the
expense of memory use. Use -h to see the default buffer
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K timeout_seconds <br>
Ensure that traffic is transmitted at a certain interval in
seconds. This is useful for working around firewalls or
routers that drop connections after a certain period of <br>
inactivity. The trade-off is that a session may be closed if
there is a temporary lapse of network connectivity. A
setting if 0 disables keepalives. If no response is <br>
received for 3 consecutive keepalives the connection will be
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I idle_timeout <br>
Disconnect the session if no traffic is transmitted or
received for idle_timeout seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J proxy_command <br>
Use the standard input/output of the program proxy_command
rather than using a normal TCP connection. A hostname should
be still be provided, as this is used for comparing <br>
saved hostkeys. This command will be executed as &quot;exec
proxy_command ...&quot; with the default shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B endhost:endport <br>
&quot;Netcat-alike&quot; mode, where Dropbear will connect
to the given host, then create a forwarded connection to
endhost. This will then be presented as dbclient&rsquo;s
standard <br>
input/output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cipherlist <br>
Specify a comma separated list of ciphers to enable. Use -c
help to list possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MAClist <br>
Specify a comma separated list of authentication MACs to
enable. Use -m help to list possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o option <br>
Can be used to give options in the format used by OpenSSH
config file. This is useful for specifying options for which
there is no separate command-line flag. For full <br>
details of the options listed below, and their possible
values, see ssh_config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For now following options have
been implemented:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExitOnForwardFailure <br>
Specifies whether dbclient should terminate the connection
if it cannot set up all requested local and remote port
forwardings. The argument must be &acirc;yes&acirc; or
&acirc;no&acirc;. <br>
The default is &acirc;no&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseSyslog <br>
Send dbclient log messages to syslog in addition to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The specified command will be
requested as a subsystem, used for sftp. Dropbear
doesn&rsquo;t implement sftp itself but the OpenSSH sftp
client can be used eg sftp -S dbclient <br>
user@host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTI-HOP <br>
Dropbear will also allow multiple &quot;hops&quot; to be
specified, separated by commas. In this case a connection
will be made to the first host, then a TCP forwarded
connection will be <br>
made through that to the second host, and so on. Hosts other
than the final destination will not see anything other than
the encrypted SSH stream. A port for a host can be
spec&acirc; <br>
ified with a caret (eg matt@martello^44 ). This syntax can
also be used with scp or rsync (specifying dbclient as the
ssh/rsh command). A file can be &quot;bounced&quot; through
multiple <br>
SSH hops, eg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scp -S dbclient
matt@martello,root@wrt,canyons:/tmp/dump .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that hostnames are resolved
by the prior hop (so &quot;canyons&quot; would be resolved
by the host &quot;wrt&quot;) in the example above, the same
way as other -L TCP forwarded hosts are. Host <br>
keys are checked locally based on the given hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCAPE CHARACTERS <br>
Typing a newline followed by the key sequence ~. (tilde,
dot) will terminate a connection. The sequence ~^Z (tilde,
ctrl-z) will background the connection. This behaviour only
<br>
applies when a PTY is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DROPBEAR_PASSWORD <br>
A password to use for remote authentication can be specified
in the environment variable DROPBEAR_PASSWORD. Care should
be taken that the password is not exposed to other <br>
users on a multi-user system, or stored in accessible
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_ASKPASS <br>
dbclient can use an external program to request a password
from a user. SSH_ASKPASS should be set to the path of a
program that will return a password on standard output. <br>
This program will only be used if either DISPLAY is set and
standard input is not a TTY, or the environment variable
SSH_ASKPASS_ALWAYS is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If compiled with zlib support and if the server supports it,
dbclient will always use compression.</p>
