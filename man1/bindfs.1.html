<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bindfs &acirc; mount --bind in user-space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bindfs [options] dir mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A FUSE filesystem for mirroring the contents of a directory
to another directory. Additionally, one can change the
permissions of files in the mirrored directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE OWNERSHIP <br>
-u, --force-user, -o force-user=... <br>
Makes all files owned by the specified user. Also causes
chown on the mounted filesystem to always fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --force-group=group, -o
force-group=... <br>
Makes all files owned by the specified group. Also causes
chgrp on the mounted filesystem to always fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --perms=permissions, -o
perms=... <br>
Takes a comma- or colon-separated list of chmod-like
permission specifications to be applied to the permission
bits in order. See PERMISSION SPECIFICATION below for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only affects how the
permission bits of existing files are altered when shown in
the mounted directory. You can use --create-with-perms to
change the permissions that <br>
newly created files get in the source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, as usual, the root
user isn&rsquo;t bound by the permissions set here. You can
get a truly read-only mount by using -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mirror=user1:user2:..., -o
mirror=... <br>
Takes a comma- or colon-separated list of users who will see
themselves as the owners of all files. Users who are not
listed here will still be able to access the mount if <br>
the permissions otherwise allow them to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also give a group name
prefixed with an &rsquo;@&rsquo; to mirror all members of a
group. This will not change which group the files are shown
to have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M,
--mirror-only=user1:user2:..., -o mirror-only=... <br>
Like --mirror but disallows access for all other users
(except root).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--map=user1/user2:@group1/@group2:...,
-o map=... <br>
Given a mapping user1/user2, all files owned by user1 are
shown as owned by user2. When user2 creates files, they are
chowned to user1 in the underlying directory. When <br>
files are chowned to user2, they are chowned to user1 in the
underlying directory. Works similarly for groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single user or group may
appear no more than once on the left and once on the right
of a slash in the list of mappings. Currently, the options
--force-user, --force- <br>
group, --mirror, --create-for-*, --chown-* and --chgrp-*
override the corresponding behavior of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires mounting as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uid-offset=..., -o
uid-offset=... <br>
Works like --map, but adds the given number to all file
owner user IDs. For instance, --uid-offset=100000 causes a
file owned by user 123 to be shown as owned by user <br>
100123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For now, this option cannot be
used together with --map. Please file an issue with the
desired semantics if you have a case for using them
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires mounting as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gid-offset=..., -o
gid-offset=... <br>
Works exactly like --uid-offset but for groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE CREATION POLICY <br>
New files and directories are created so they are owned by
the mounter. bindfs can let this happen (the default for
normal users), or it can try to change the owner to the <br>
uid/gid of the process that wants to create the file (the
default for root). It is also possible to have bindfs try to
change the owner to a particular user or group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-as-user, -o
create-as-user <br>
Tries to change the owner and group of new files and
directories to the uid and gid of the caller. This can work
only if the mounter is root. It is also the default <br>
behavior (mimicing mount --bind) if the mounter is root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-as-mounter, -o
create-as-mounter <br>
All new files and directories will be owned by the mounter.
This is the default behavior for non-root mounters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-for-user=user, -o
create-for-user=... <br>
Tries to change the owner of new files and directories to
the user specified here. This can work only if the mounter
is root. This option overrides the --create-as-user <br>
and --create-as-mounter options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-for-group=group, -o
create-for-group=... <br>
Tries to change the owning group of new files and
directories to the group specified here. This can work only
if the mounter is root. This option overrides the
--cre&acirc; <br>
ate-as-user and --create-as-mounter options.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-with-perms=permissions,
-o create-with-perms=... <br>
Works like --perms but is applied to the permission bits of
new files get in the source directory. Normally the
permissions of new files depend on the creating
process&rsquo;s <br>
preferences and umask. This option can be used to modify
those permissions or override them completely. See
PERMISSION SPECIFICATION below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHOWN/CHGRP POLICY <br>
The behaviour on chown/chgrp calls can be changed. By
default they are passed through to the source directory even
if bindfs is set to show a fake owner/group. A chown/chgrp
call <br>
will only succeed if the user has enough mirrored
permissions to chmod the mirrored file AND the mounter has
enough permissions to chmod the real file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chown-normal, -o chown-normal
<br>
Tries to chown the underlying file. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chown-ignore, -o chown-ignore
<br>
Lets chown succeed (if the user has enough mirrored
permissions) but actually does nothing. A combined
chown/chgrp is effectively turned into a chgrp-only
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chown-deny, -o chown-deny <br>
Makes chown always fail with a &rsquo;permission
denied&rsquo; error. A combined chown/chgrp request will
fail as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chgrp-normal, -o chgrp-normal
<br>
Tries to chgrp the underlying file. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chgrp-ignore, -o chgrp-ignore
<br>
Lets chgrp succeed (if the user has enough mirrored
permissions) but actually does nothing. A combined
chown/chgrp is effectively turned into a chown-only
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chgrp-deny, -o chgrp-deny <br>
Makes chgrp always fail with a &rsquo;permission
denied&rsquo; error. A combined chown/chgrp request will
fail as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHMOD POLICY <br>
Chmod calls are forwarded to the source directory by
default. This may cause unexpected behaviour if bindfs is
altering permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod-normal, -o chmod-normal
<br>
Tries to chmod the underlying file. This will succeed if the
user has the appropriate mirrored permissions to chmod the
mirrored file AND the mounter has enough permis&acirc; <br>
sions to chmod the real file. This is the default (in order
to behave like mount --bind by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod-ignore, -o chmod-ignore
<br>
Lets chmod succeed (if the user has enough mirrored
permissions) but actually does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod-deny, -o chmod-deny <br>
Makes chmod always fail with a &rsquo;permission
denied&rsquo; error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod-filter=permissions, -o
chmod-filter=... <br>
Changes the permission bits of a chmod request before it is
applied to the original file. Accepts the same permission
syntax as --perms. See PERMISSION SPECIFICATION <br>
below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod-allow-x, -o
chmod-allow-x <br>
Allows setting and clearing the executable attribute on
files (but not directories). When used with --chmod-ignore,
chmods will only affect execute bits on files and <br>
changes to other bits are discarded. With --chmod-deny, all
chmods that would change any bits except excecute bits on
files will still fail with a &rsquo;permission
denied&rsquo;. <br>
This option does nothing with --chmod-normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XATTR POLICY <br>
Extended attributes are mirrored by default, though not all
underlying file systems support xattrs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xattr-none, -o xattr-none <br>
Disable extended attributes altogether. All operations will
return &rsquo;Operation not supported&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xattr-ro, -o xattr-ro <br>
Let extended attributes be read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xattr-rw, -o xattr-rw <br>
Let extended attributes be read-write (the default). The
read/write permissions are checked against the (possibly
modified) file permissions inside the mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATE LIMITS <br>
Reads and writes through the mount point can be throttled.
Throttling works by sleeping the required amount of time on
each read or write request. Throttling imposes one global
<br>
limit on all readers/writers as opposed to a per-process or
per-user limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the implementation is
not entirely fair. See BUGS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--read-rate=N, -o read-rate=N
<br>
Allow at most N bytes per second to be read. N may have one
of the following (1024-based) suffixes: k, M, G, T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--write-rate=N, -o write-rate=N
<br>
Same as above, but for writes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINK HANDLING <br>
--hide-hard-links, -o hide-hard-links <br>
Shows the hard link count of all files as 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolve-symlinks, -o
resolve-symlinks <br>
Transparently resolves symbolic links. Disables creation of
new symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the following exceptions,
operations will operate directly on the target file instead
of the symlink. Renaming/moving a resolved symlink (inside
the same mount point) <br>
will move the symlink instead of the underlying file.
Deleting a resolved symlink will delete the underlying
symlink but not the destination file. This can be configured
<br>
with --resolved-symlink-deletion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when some programs,
such as vim, save files, they actually move the old file out
of the way, create a new file in its place, and finally
delete the old file. <br>
Doing these operations on a resolved symlink will replace it
with a regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symlinks pointing outside the
source directory are supported with the following exception:
accessing the mountpoint recursively through a resolved
symlink is not supported <br>
and will return an error. This is because a FUSE filesystem
cannot reliably call itself recursively without deadlocking,
especially in single-threaded mode.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolved-symlink-deletion=policy,
-o resolved-symlink-deletion=policy <br>
If --resolve-symlinks is enabled, decides what happens when
a resolved symlink is deleted. The options are: deny
(resolved symlinks cannot be deleted), symlink-only (the
<br>
underlying symlink is deleted, its target is not),
symlink-first (the symlink is deleted, and if that succeeds,
the target is deleted but no error is reported if that <br>
fails) or target-first (the target is deleted first, and the
symlink is deleted only if deleting the target succeeded).
The default is symlink-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that deleting files inside
symlinked directories is always possible with all settings,
including deny, unless something else protects those
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Displays a help message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Displays version information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-allow-other, -o
no-allow-other <br>
Does not add -o allow_other to FUSE options. This causes the
mount to be accessible only by the current user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--realistic-permissions, -o
realistic-permissions <br>
Hides read/write/execute permissions for a mirrored file
when the mounter doesn&rsquo;t have read/write/execute
access to the underlying file. Useless when mounting as
root, <br>
since root will always have full access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Prior to version 1.10 this
option was the default behavior. I felt it violated the
principle of least surprise badly enough to warrant a small
break in backwards-compat&acirc; <br>
ibility.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ctime-from-mtime, -o
ctime-from-mtime <br>
Recall that a unix file has three standard timestamps: atime
(last access i.e. read time), mtime (last content
modification time) ctime (last content or metadata (inode)
<br>
change time)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option, the ctime of
each file and directory is read from its mtime. In other
words, only content modifications (as opposed to metadata
changes) will be <br>
reflected in a mirrored file&rsquo;s ctime. The underlying
file&rsquo;s ctime will still be updated normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-lock-forwarding, -o
enable-lock-forwarding <br>
Forwards flock and fcntl locking requests to the source
directory. This way, locking a file in the bindfs mount will
also lock the file in the source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option must be used with
--multithreaded because otherwise bindfs will deadlock as
soon as there is lock contention. However, see BUGS below
for caveats about --mul&acirc; <br>
tithreaded with the current implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-lock-forwarding, -o
disable-lock-forwarding <br>
Currently does nothing, but a future release may default to
enabling lock forwarding. If you depend on this behaviour,
it&rsquo;s recommended to set this flag explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-ioctl, -o enable-ioctl
<br>
Enables forwarding of ioctl, which is needed for some
advanced features such as append-only files (chattr +a).
Note that the ioctl action will be performed as the mounter,
<br>
not the calling user. No efforts are made to check whether
the calling user would ordinarily have the permissions to
make the ioctl. This may be a security concern, espe&acirc;
<br>
cially when mounting as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multithreaded, -o
multithreaded <br>
Run bindfs in multithreaded mode. While bindfs is designed
to be otherwise thread-safe, there is currently a race
condition that may pose a security risk for some use <br>
cases. See BUGS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUSE OPTIONS <br>
-o options <br>
Fuse options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, -o ro <br>
Make the mount strictly read-only. This even prevents root
from writing to it. If this is all you need, then (since
Linux 2.6.26) you can get a more efficent mount with <br>
mount --bind and then mount -o remount,ro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -o debug <br>
Enable debug output (implies -f).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Foreground operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERMISSION SPECIFICATION <br>
The -p option takes a comma- or colon-separated list of
either octal numeric permission bits or symbolic
representations of permission bit operations. The symbolic
representa&acirc; <br>
tion is based on that of the chmod(1) command. setuid,
setgid and sticky bits are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program extends the chmod
symbolic representation with the following operands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;D&rsquo; (right hand
side) <br>
Works like X but applies only to directories (not to
executables).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;d&rsquo; and
&lsquo;f&rsquo; (left hand side) <br>
Makes this directive only apply to directories (d) or files
(f). <br>
e.g. gd-w would remove the group write bit from all
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;u&rsquo;,
&lsquo;g&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo; (right hand side) <br>
Uses the user (u), group (g) or others (o) permission bits
of <br>
the original file. <br>
e.g. g=u would copy the user&rsquo;s permission bits to the
group. <br>
ug+o would add the others&rsquo; permissions to the owner
and group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o-rwx Removes all permission
bits from others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g=rD Allows group to read all
files and enter all directories, but nothing else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0644,a+X <br>
Sets permission bits to 0644 and adds the execute bit for
everyone to all directories and executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">og-x:og+rD:u=rwX:g+rw <br>
Removes execute bit for others and group, adds read and
directory execute for others and group, sets user
permissions to read, write and execute directory/executable,
adds <br>
read and write for group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindfs -u www -g nogroup -p
0000,u=rD ~/mywebsite ~/public_html/mysite</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Publishes a website in
public_html so that only the &rsquo;www&rsquo; user can read
the site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindfs -M foo,bar,1007,@mygroup
-p 0600,u+X dir mnt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gives access to
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;, &rsquo;bar&rsquo;, the user with the UID
1007 as well as everyone in the group &rsquo;mygroup&rsquo;.
Sets the permission bits to 0600, thus giving the specified
users <br>
read/write access, and adds the user execute bit for
directories and executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindfs
-ono-allow-other,perms=a-w somedir somedir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makes a directory read-only and
accessable only by the current user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/bob/shared
/var/www/shared/bob fuse.bindfs perms=0000:u+rD 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example /etc/fstab entry.
Note that the colon must be used to separate arguments to
perms, because the comma is an option separator in
/etc/fstab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindfs#/home/bob/shared
/var/www/shared/bob fuse perms=0000:u+rD 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older systems may require this
deprecated fstab syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Setuid and setgid bits have no effect inside the mount. This
is a necessary security feature of FUSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MacFuse caches file contents by
default. This means that changes in source files are not
always immediately visible under the mount point. -o
nolocalcaches can be used to dis&acirc; <br>
able the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using --mirror[-only]
@somegroup, bindfs won&rsquo;t see changes to the
group&rsquo;s member list. Sending bindfs a SIGUSR1 signal
will make it reread the user database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following extra options may
be useful under osxfuse: -o
local,allow_other,extended_security,noappledouble See
https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/Mount-options for
<br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If bindfs is run in multithreaded mode (with the
--multithreaded option) then it&rsquo;s possible for another
process to briefly see a file with an incorrect owner, group
or permis&acirc; <br>
sions. This may constitute a security risk if you rely on
bindfs to reduce permissions on new files. For this reason,
as of version 1.11 bindfs runs in single-threaded mode by
<br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rate limiting favors the process
with the larger block size. If two processes compete for
read/write access, the one whose read()/write() calls
specify the larger block size <br>
gets to read/write faster. The total rate limit is
maintained though, and clients with equal block sizes and a
similar rate of requests are treated fairly as long as the
kernel <br>
orders their requests fairly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some features relying on xattrs
might not work properly on OS X
(https://github.com/mpartel/bindfs/issues/21). For instance,
Finder tags seem to work but comments might not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please report bugs and/or send
pull requests to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPRECATIONS <br>
The option names --user and --group were deprecated and
replaced with --force-user and --force-group in version
1.12. The former names clashed with standard option names.
They <br>
are still available but their use is discouraged and prints
a warning. The synonym --owner is also deprecated for
consistency.</p>
