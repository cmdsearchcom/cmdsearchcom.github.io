job</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
condor_ssh_to_jobcreates an sshsession to a running job. The
job is specified with the argument. If only the job
clusterid is given, then the job processid defaults to the
value <br>
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">condor_ssh_to_jobis available in
Unix HTCondor distributions, and works with two kinds of
jobs: those in the vanilla, vm, java, local, or parallel
universes, and those jobs in <br>
the grid universe which use EC2 resources. It will not work
with other grid universe jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For jobs in the vanilla, vm,
java, local, or parallel universes, the user must be the
owner of the job or must be a queue super user, and both the
condor_scheddand condor_star&acirc; <br>
terdaemons must allow condor_ssh_to_jobaccess. If no
remote-commandis specified, an interactive shell is created.
An alternate sshprogram such as sftpmay be specified, using
the <br>
-sshoption, for uploading and downloading files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remote command or shell runs
with the same user id as the running job, and it is
initialized with the same working directory. The environment
is initialized to be the same as <br>
that of the job, plus any changes made by the shell setup
scripts and any environment variables passed by the
sshclient. In addition, the environment variable
_CONDOR_JOB_PIDS <br>
is defined. It is a space-separated list of PIDs associated
with the job. At a minimum, the list will contain the PID of
the process started when the job was launched, and it <br>
will be the first item in the list. It may contain
additional PIDs of other processes that the job has
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sshsession and all processes
it creates are treated by HTCondor as though they are
processes belonging to the job. If the slot is preempted or
suspended, the sshsession is <br>
killed or suspended along with the job. If the job exits
before the sshsession finishes, the slot remains in the
Claimed Busy state and is treated as though not all job
processes <br>
have exited until all sshsessions are closed. Multiple
sshsessions may be created to the same job at the same time.
Resource consumption of the sshdprocess and all processes
<br>
spawned by it are monitored by the condor_starteras though
these processes belong to the job, so any policies such as
PREEMPT that enforce a limit on resource consumption also
<br>
take into account resources consumed by the sshsession.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">condor_ssh_to_jobstores ssh keys
in temporary files within a newly created and uniquely named
directory. The newly created directory will be within the
directory defined by the <br>
environment variable TMPDIR . When the ssh session is
finished, this directory and the ssh keys contained within
it are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the HTCondor
administrator&rsquo;s manual section on configuration for
details of the configuration variables related to
condor_ssh_to_job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An sshsession works by first
authenticating and authorizing a secure connection between
condor_ssh_to_joband the condor_starterdaemon, using
HTCondor protocols. The con&acirc; <br>
dor_startergenerates an ssh key pair and sends it securely
to condor_ssh_to_job. Then the condor_starterspawns sshdin
inetd mode with its stdin and stdout attached to the TCP
<br>
connection from condor_ssh_to_job. condor_ssh_to_jobacts as
a proxy for the sshclient to communicate with sshd, using
the existing connection authorized by HTCondor. At no point
<br>
is sshdlistening on the network for connections or running
with any privileges other than that of the user identity
running the job.If CCB is being used to enable connectivity
to <br>
the execute node from outside of a firewall or private
network, condor_ssh_to_jobis able to make use of CCB in
order to form the sshconnection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The login shell of the user id
running the job is used to run the requested command,
sshdsubsystem, or interactive shell. This is hard-coded
behavior in OpenSSHand cannot be <br>
overridden by configuration. This means that
condor_ssh_to_jobaccess is effectively disabled if the login
shell disables access, as in the example programs
/bin/trueand <br>
/sbin/nologin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">condor_ssh_to_jobis intended to
work with OpenSSHas installed in typical environments. It
does not work on Windows platforms. If the sshprograms are
installed in non-standard <br>
locations, then the paths to these programs will need to be
customized within the HTCondor configuration. Versions of
sshother than OpenSSHmay work, but they will likely require
<br>
additional configuration of command-line arguments, changes
to the sshdconfiguration template file, and possibly
modification of the $(LIBEXEC)/condor_ssh_to_job_sshd_setup
<br>
script used by the condor_starterto set up sshd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For jobs in the grid universe
which use EC2 resources, a request that HTCondor have the
EC2 service create a new key pair for the job by specifying
ec2_keypair_filecauses con&acirc; <br>
dor_ssh_to_jobto attempt to connect to the corresponding
instance via ssh. This attempts invokes sshdirectly,
bypassing the HTCondor networking layer. It supplies sshwith
the <br>
public DNS name of the instance and the name of the file
with the new key pair&rsquo;s private key. For the
connection to succeed, the instance must have started an
sshserver, and its <br>
security group(s) must allow connections on port 22.
Conventionally, images will allow logins using the key pair
on a single specific account. Because sshdefaults to logging
in <br>
as the current user, the -l &lt;username&gt;option or its
equivalent for other versions of sshwill be needed as part
of the remote-commandargument. Although the -Xoption does
not apply <br>
to EC2 jobs, adding -Xor -Yto the remote-commandargument can
duplicate the effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display brief usage information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes debugging information to
be sent to stderr , based on the value of the configuration
variable TOOL_DEBUG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name schedd-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify an alternate
condor_schedd, if the default (local) one is not
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pool pool-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify an alternate HTCondor
pool, if the default one is not desired. Does not apply to
EC2 jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ssh ssh-command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify an alternate sshprogram
to run in place of ssh, for example sftpor scp. Additional
arguments are specified as ssh-command. Since the arguments
are delimited by spaces, <br>
place double quote marks around the whole command, to
prevent the shell from splitting it into multiple arguments
to condor_ssh_to_job . If any arguments must contain spaces,
<br>
enclose them within single quotes. Does not apply to EC2
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keygen-options
ssh-keygen-options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify additional arguments to
the ssh_keygenprogram, for creating the ssh key that is used
for the duration of the session. For example, a different
number of bits could be <br>
used, or a different key type than the default. Does not
apply to EC2 jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shells shell1,shell2,...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a comma-separated list
of shells to attempt to launch. If the first shell does not
exist on the remote machine, then the following ones in the
list will be tried. If <br>
none of the specified shells can be found, /bin/shis used by
default. If this option is not specified, it defaults to the
environment variable SHELL from within the con&acirc; <br>
dor_ssh_to_job environment. Does not apply to EC2 jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-auto-retry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that if the job is not
yet running, condor_ssh_to_job should keep trying
periodically until it succeeds or encounters some other
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove-on-interrupt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If specified, attempt to remove
the job from the queue if condor_ssh_to_job is interrupted
via a CTRL-c or otherwise terminated abnormally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable X11 forwarding. Does not
apply to EC2 jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
% condor_ssh_to_job 32.0 <br>
Welcome to slot2@tonic.cs.wisc.edu! <br>
Your condor job is running with pid(s) 65881. <br>
% gdb -p 65881 <br>
(gdb) where <br>
% logout <br>
Connection to condor-job.tonic.cs.wisc.edu closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To upload or download files
interactively with sftp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% condor_ssh_to_job -ssh sftp
32.0 <br>
Connecting to condor-job.tonic.cs.wisc.edu... <br>
sftp&gt; ls <br>
sftp&gt; get outputfile.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example shows downloading a
file from the job with scp. The string &quot;remote&quot; is
used in place of a host name in this example. It is not
necessary to insert the correct remote <br>
host name, or even a valid one, because the connection to
the job is created automatically. Therefore, the placeholder
string &quot;remote&quot; is perfectly fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% condor_ssh_to_job -ssh scp 32
remote:outputfile.dat .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example uses
condor_ssh_to_jobto accomplish the task of running rsyncto
synchronize a local file with a remote file in the
job&rsquo;s working directory. Job id 32.0 is used in <br>
place of a host name in this example. This causes rsyncto
insert the expected job id in the arguments to
condor_ssh_to_job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% rsync -v -e
&quot;condor_ssh_to_job &quot; 32.0:outputfile.dat .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that condor_ssh_to_jobwas
added to HTCondor in version 7.3. If one uses
condor_ssh_to_jobto connect to a job on an execute machine
running a version of HTCondor older than <br>
the 7.3 series, the command will fail with the error
message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed to send
CREATE_JOB_OWNER_SEC_SESSION to starter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit Status <br>
condor_ssh_to_jobwill exit with a non-zero status value if
it fails to set up an ssh session. If it succeeds, it will
exit with the status value of the remote command or
shell.</p>
