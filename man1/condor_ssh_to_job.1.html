condor_ssh_to_jobcreates an sshsession to a running job. The job is specified
  with the argument. If only the job clusterid is given, then the job processid
  defaults to the value 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
condor_ssh_to_jobis available in Unix HTCondor distributions, and works with two
  kinds of jobs: those in the vanilla, vm, java, local, or parallel universes,
  and those jobs in the grid universe which use EC2 resources. It will not work
  with other grid universe jobs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For jobs in the vanilla, vm, java, local, or parallel universes, the user must
  be the owner of the job or must be a queue super user, and both the
  condor_scheddand condor_starterdaemons must allow condor_ssh_to_jobaccess. If
  no remote-commandis specified, an interactive shell is created. An alternate
  sshprogram such as sftpmay be specified, using the -sshoption, for uploading
  and downloading files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remote command or shell runs with the same user id as the running job, and
  it is initialized with the same working directory. The environment is
  initialized to be the same as that of the job, plus any changes made by the
  shell setup scripts and any environment variables passed by the sshclient. In
  addition, the environment variable _CONDOR_JOB_PIDS is defined. It is a
  space-separated list of PIDs associated with the job. At a minimum, the list
  will contain the PID of the process started when the job was launched, and it
  will be the first item in the list. It may contain additional PIDs of other
  processes that the job has created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sshsession and all processes it creates are treated by HTCondor as though
  they are processes belonging to the job. If the slot is preempted or
  suspended, the sshsession is killed or suspended along with the job. If the
  job exits before the sshsession finishes, the slot remains in the Claimed Busy
  state and is treated as though not all job processes have exited until all
  sshsessions are closed. Multiple sshsessions may be created to the same job at
  the same time. Resource consumption of the sshdprocess and all processes
  spawned by it are monitored by the condor_starteras though these processes
  belong to the job, so any policies such as PREEMPT that enforce a limit on
  resource consumption also take into account resources consumed by the
  sshsession.
<div class="Pp"></div>
condor_ssh_to_jobstores ssh keys in temporary files within a newly created and
  uniquely named directory. The newly created directory will be within the
  directory defined by the environment variable TMPDIR . When the ssh session is
  finished, this directory and the ssh keys contained within it are removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the HTCondor administrator's manual section on configuration for details of
  the configuration variables related to condor_ssh_to_job.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An sshsession works by first authenticating and authorizing a secure connection
  between condor_ssh_to_joband the condor_starterdaemon, using HTCondor
  protocols. The condor_startergenerates an ssh key pair and sends it securely
  to condor_ssh_to_job. Then the condor_starterspawns sshdin inetd mode with its
  stdin and stdout attached to the TCP connection from condor_ssh_to_job.
  condor_ssh_to_jobacts as a proxy for the sshclient to communicate with sshd,
  using the existing connection authorized by HTCondor. At no point is
  sshdlistening on the network for connections or running with any privileges
  other than that of the user identity running the job.If CCB is being used to
  enable connectivity to the execute node from outside of a firewall or private
  network, condor_ssh_to_jobis able to make use of CCB in order to form the
  sshconnection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The login shell of the user id running the job is used to run the requested
  command, sshdsubsystem, or interactive shell. This is hard-coded behavior in
  OpenSSHand cannot be overridden by configuration. This means that
  condor_ssh_to_jobaccess is effectively disabled if the login shell disables
  access, as in the example programs /bin/trueand /sbin/nologin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
condor_ssh_to_jobis intended to work with OpenSSHas installed in typical
  environments. It does not work on Windows platforms. If the sshprograms are
  installed in non-standard locations, then the paths to these programs will
  need to be customized within the HTCondor configuration. Versions of sshother
  than OpenSSHmay work, but they will likely require additional configuration of
  command-line arguments, changes to the sshdconfiguration template file, and
  possibly modification of the $(LIBEXEC)/condor_ssh_to_job_sshd_setup script
  used by the condor_starterto set up sshd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For jobs in the grid universe which use EC2 resources, a request that HTCondor
  have the EC2 service create a new key pair for the job by specifying
  ec2_keypair_filecauses condor_ssh_to_jobto attempt to connect to the
  corresponding instance via ssh. This attempts invokes sshdirectly, bypassing
  the HTCondor networking layer. It supplies sshwith the public DNS name of the
  instance and the name of the file with the new key pair's private key. For the
  connection to succeed, the instance must have started an sshserver, and its
  security group(s) must allow connections on port 22. Conventionally, images
  will allow logins using the key pair on a single specific account. Because
  sshdefaults to logging in as the current user, the -l &lt;username&gt;option
  or its equivalent for other versions of sshwill be needed as part of the
  remote-commandargument. Although the -Xoption does not apply to EC2 jobs,
  adding -Xor -Yto the remote-commandargument can duplicate the effect.

% condor_ssh_to_job 32.0

<div class="Pp"></div>
To upload or download files interactively with sftp:
<div class="Pp"></div>
% condor_ssh_to_job -ssh sftp 32.0

Connecting to condor-job.tonic.cs.wisc.edu...

sftp&gt; ls
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
sftp&gt; get outputfile.dat
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example shows downloading a file from the job with scp. The string
  &quot;remote&quot; is used in place of a host name in this example. It is not
  necessary to insert the correct remote host name, or even a valid one, because
  the connection to the job is created automatically. Therefore, the placeholder
  string &quot;remote&quot; is perfectly fine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
% condor_ssh_to_job -ssh scp 32 remote:outputfile.dat .
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example uses condor_ssh_to_jobto accomplish the task of running rsyncto
  synchronize a local file with a remote file in the job's working directory.
  Job id 32.0 is used in place of a host name in this example. This causes
  rsyncto insert the expected job id in the arguments to condor_ssh_to_job.
<div class="Pp"></div>
% rsync -v -e &quot;condor_ssh_to_job &quot; 32.0:outputfile.dat .
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that condor_ssh_to_jobwas added to HTCondor in version 7.3. If one uses
  condor_ssh_to_jobto connect to a job on an execute machine running a version
  of HTCondor older than the 7.3 series, the command will fail with the error
  message
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Exit_Status"><a class="selflink" href="#Exit_Status">Exit
  Status</a></h1>
condor_ssh_to_jobwill exit with a non-zero status value if it fails to set up an
  ssh session. If it succeeds, it will exit with the status value of the remote
  command or shell.
