<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp stores a variety of information about how any given file was built the
  last time. This information includes the build command, the architecture, and
  the signatures of all the file's dependencies. (All the stored information is
  in the subdirectory <i>.makepp</i> of each directory.) If any of this
  information has changed, makepp usually decides to rebuild the file. The build
  check method is what controls makepp's decision to rebuild. It decides which
  information to look at, and which to ignore.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp usually picks the correct build check method automatically. However, you
  can change the signature method for an individual rule by using :build_check
  modifier on the rule, or for all rules in a makefile by using the build_check
  statement, or for all makefiles at once using the -m or --build-check-method
  command line option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data used to decide about a rebuild or a repository or build cache import is
  stored in the internal build info file. You can display it with makeppinfo,
  mppi. Below each method gives an example of how to see its keys.

  check methods included in the distribution</a></h2>
At present, there are five build check methods included in the distribution:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">exact_match</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This method uses the modification dates on the file as
      signatures. It rebuilds the targets unless all of the following conditions
      are true:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The signature of each dependency is the same as it was on
      the last build.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The signature of each target is the same as it was on the
      last build (i.e., no one has messed with the targets since makepp built
      them).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The build command has not changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The machine architecture (or what Perl thinks it is) has
      not changed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;exact_match&quot; is the default method unless you are rebuilding a
  Makefile (see below). This is a highly reliable way of ensuring correct
  builds, and is almost always what you want. However, it does have a few side
  effects that may be surprising:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you've been compiling with the traditional make, and
      then switch to makepp, everything is recompiled the first time you run
      makepp.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you damage makepp's information about what happened on
      the last build (e.g., you delete the subdirectory &quot;.makepp&quot;, or
      don't copy it when you copy everything else), then a rebuild is
    triggered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you replace a file with an older version, a rebuild is
      triggered. This is normally what you want, but it might be
    surprising.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you modify a file outside of the control of makepp
      (e.g., you run the compilation command yourself), then makepp will rebuild
      the file next time. (If you want to avoid this, check out the
      &quot;--dont-build&quot; command line option.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Architecture-independent files are rebuilt when you switch
      to a different architecture. This is usually not a problem, because they
      often don't take long to build. The reason why all files are tagged with
      the architecture, instead of just binary files, is that often times even
      ASCII files are architecture-dependent. For example, output from the
      Solaris &quot;lex&quot; program won't compile on Linux (or at least this
      used to be true the last time I tried it).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Concretely, a file will not be rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or
  build cache, if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches the
  signatures of the dependencies:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    mppi -k'COMMAND ARCH SORTED_DEPS DEP_SIGS ENV_{DEP,VAL}S' file
</pre>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">architecture_independent</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;architecture_independent&quot; method is the same
      as &quot;exact_match&quot; except that it does not check the architecture.
      This can be useful for architecture-independent files, that don't need to
      be rebuilt when you switch to a different architecture. For example, you
      probably don't need to rerun &quot;bison&quot; on Solaris if you already
      ran it on Linux.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;architecture_independent&quot; method is best used by specifying
      it using the &quot;:build_check&#x00A0;architecture_independent&quot;
      modifier to the each rule that produces architecture independent files.
      Makepp by default never assumes any files are architecture independent,
      because even <i>.c</i> files can be architecture dependent. For example,
      the output of Solaris lex will not compile under Linux, or at least it
      wouldn't last time I tried. So you must manually specify this build check
      method for any files which are truly architecture-independent.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Concretely, a file will not be rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or
      build cache, if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
      the signatures of the dependencies:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    mppi -k'COMMAND SORTED_DEPS DEP_SIGS ENV_{DEP,VAL}S' file
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ignore_action</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;ignore_action&quot; method is the same as
      &quot;exact_match&quot; except that it does not check the action string
      (the command). Sometimes a command can change and you don't want to force
      a rebuild.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, you might want to explicitly put a date into your command to
      log when the build was done, but you don't want to force a rebuild every
      time the command is executed. For example,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    BUILD_DATE := $(shell date)
    my_program : $(MODULES).o
        $(CXX) $(inputs) -DBUILD_DATE=&quot;\&quot;$(BUILD_DATE)\&quot;&quot; date_stamp.c -o $(output)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This will compile <i>date_stamp.c</i> with the last build date stamp, but
      won't force a recompile when the date changes. Unfortunately, if something
      else about the link command changes (e.g., you change linker options), it
      also won't trigger a rebuild.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is also useful in conjunction with the $(changed_inputs) or $? variable
      for actions that merely update a target, rather than rebuilding it from
      scratch. For example, you could update a .a file like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    libmine.a : *.o : build_check ignore_action
        $(AR) ru $(output) $(changed_inputs)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This will still mostly work if you forget to specify the &quot;: build_check
      ignore_action&quot;. However, suppose that none of the .o files have
      changed. The command will now be &quot;ar&#x00A0;ru&#x00A0;libmine.a&quot;
      which is probably different from what it was last time (e.g.,
      &quot;ar&#x00A0;ru&#x00A0;libmine.a&#x00A0;buggy_module.o&quot;), so
      makepp will run the command. In this case, the command won't do anything
      except waste time.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Building .a files like this is discouraged, because it can leave stale .o
      files inside the archive. If you delete a source file, the .o file is
      still inside the .a file, and this can lead to incorrect builds. It's
      better to build a .a file like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    libmine.a : *.o
        &amp;rm $(output)
        $(AR) ru $(output) $(inputs)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Concretely, a file will not be rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or
      build cache, if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
      the signatures of the dependencies:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    mppi -k'ARCH SORTED_DEPS DEP_SIGS ENV_{DEP,VAL}S' file
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">target_newer</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;target_newer&quot; method looks only at the file
      date. If any dependency is more recent than the target, the target is
      rebuilt. This is the algorithm that the traditional Unix <i>make</i>
      utility uses.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;target_newer&quot; method isn't as safe as the
      &quot;exact_match&quot; method because it won't trigger a rebuild if you
      change the build command, or if you replace a file with an older version.
      Sometimes also it can get confused if clocks are not properly
      synchronized. For example, if a file somehow gets a date of June 4, 2048,
      then between now and 2048, every file that depends on that file will be
      rebuilt even though the file doesn't change. Also switching to a different
      architecture won't trigger a rebuild. It prevents fetching a rule's target
      from a build cache, because there is no unique signature that can be
      associated to the endless set of pairs fulfilling the relationship newer
      than.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But there are a few cases where you may want to use the
      &quot;target_newer&quot; method:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When it is reasonable for a user to build a file outside of
      the control of makepp. Perhaps the most common example are the commands
      that generate the makefile itself, i.e., the autoconfigure procedure.
      Users commonly issue the configure command manually, but makefiles often
      have a way to update themselves automatically. In this case, we don't want
      to force the makefile to rebuild itself if the user typed the command in
      manually, so the &quot;target_newer&quot; method is more appropriate than
      the &quot;exact_match&quot; method. In fact, if makepp is trying to build
      a makefile, it makes &quot;target_newer&quot; the default method until it
      has finished building the makefile.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When it is reasonable for a user to modify a file after
      makepp has built it. For example, if a file does not exist, you may want
      to copy it from a central location, or check it out from a repository; but
      the user should be allowed to modify it. If you use the default
      &quot;exact_match&quot; build check method, makepp will detect that the
      user has changed the file and so it will force a fresh copy from the
      central location or a fresh checkout, wiping out the user's changes.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to manually check the timestamps, see makeppinfo examples for how to
  get the path of each dependency.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">only_action</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The very specific &quot;only_action&quot; method will only
      execute the action if the command string differs from the last time it was
      executed. For example,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $(ROOT)/include/%.h : %.h
        &amp;ln -fr $(input) $(output)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    publishes a file, but does not repeat this when the file changes. Note that
      the &amp;ln command is builtin and thus cheap, but makepp still has to
      fork off and monitor a process to perform the whole action. So if you have
      lots of files to publish, there is still a benefit. Actually we did not
      specify the method, because, when the target is a symbolic link, this
      build check gets used automatically. You only need to specify it for other
      commands that depend solely on the command (which usually contains the
      names of the inputs):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    %.list : %.x : build_check only_action
        &amp;echo $(inputs) -o $(output)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Concretely, a file will not be rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or
      build cache, if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
      the signatures of the dependencies:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    mppi -kCOMMAND file
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other build check methods are possible. You can write your own build check
  method by creating a module &quot;Mpp::BuildCheck::MyMethod&quot;. Read the
  documentation in <i>Mpp/BuildCheck.pm</i> in the makepp distribution. Most
  likely, you will want your build check method to inherit from
  &quot;Mpp::BuildCheck::exact_match&quot;, so read its documentation too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's more commonly useful modify the signature mechanism than to modify the
  build check mechanism directly. Before you change the build check mechanism,
  see if your problem is better served by changing signatures (see
  makepp_signatures for details).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some reasons why a custom build check method might be useful:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you want makepp to ignore part of the command. For
      example, if you have commands in your makefile like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    x.o : x.c
        ssh $(REMOTE_MACHINE) cc $&lt; -o $@
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    you might want makepp not to force a rebuild if
      &quot;$(REMOTE_MACHINE)&quot; changes. You could modify the
      &quot;exact_match&quot; method so it knows about ssh commands and ignores
      the machine name. Check :dispatch for another way to achieve that.</dd>
