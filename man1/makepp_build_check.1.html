<p>MAKEPP_BUILD_CHECK(1) Makepp MAKEPP_BUILD_CHECK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_build_check -- How makepp decides to rebuild
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A: &quot;architecture_independent&quot;, E:
&quot;exact_match&quot;, I: &quot;ignore_action&quot;, O:
&quot;only_action&quot;, T: &quot;target_newer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp stores a variety of
information about how any given file was built the last
time. This information includes the build command, the
architecture, and the signatures of all <br>
the file&rsquo;s dependencies. (All the stored information
is in the subdirectory .makepp of each directory.) If any of
this information has changed, makepp usually decides to <br>
rebuild the file. The build check method is what controls
makepp&rsquo;s decision to rebuild. It decides which
information to look at, and which to ignore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp usually picks the correct
build check method automatically. However, you can change
the signature method for an individual rule by using
:build_check modifier on the <br>
rule, or for all rules in a makefile by using the
build_check statement, or for all makefiles at once using
the -m or --build-check-method command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data used to decide about a
rebuild or a repository or build cache import is stored in
the internal build info file. You can display it with
makeppinfo, mppi. Below each <br>
method gives an example of how to see its keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build check methods included in
the distribution <br>
At present, there are five build check methods included in
the distribution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exact_match <br>
This method uses the modification dates on the file as
signatures. It rebuilds the targets unless all of the
following conditions are true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature of
each dependency is the same as it was on the last build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature of
each target is the same as it was on the last build (i.e.,
no one has messed with the targets since makepp built
them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The build
command has not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The machine
architecture (or what Perl thinks it is) has not
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;exact_match&quot; is the
default method unless you are rebuilding a Makefile (see
below). This is a highly reliable way of ensuring correct
builds, and is almost always what you <br>
want. However, it does have a few side effects that may be
surprising:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you&rsquo;ve
been compiling with the traditional make, and then switch to
makepp, everything is recompiled the first time you run
makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you damage
makepp&rsquo;s information about what happened on the last
build (e.g., you delete the subdirectory
&quot;.makepp&quot;, or don&rsquo;t copy it when you copy
everything else), <br>
then a rebuild is triggered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you replace a
file with an older version, a rebuild is triggered. This is
normally what you want, but it might be surprising.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you modify a
file outside of the control of makepp (e.g., you run the
compilation command yourself), then makepp will rebuild the
file next time. (If you want to <br>
avoid this, check out the &quot;--dont-build&quot; command
line option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Architecture-independent files are rebuilt when you switch
to a different architecture. This is usually not a problem,
because they often don&rsquo;t take long to build. The <br>
reason why all files are tagged with the architecture,
instead of just binary files, is that often times even ASCII
files are architecture-dependent. For example, output <br>
from the Solaris &quot;lex&quot; program won&rsquo;t compile
on Linux (or at least this used to be true the last time I
tried it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concretely, a file will not be
rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or build cache,
if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
the signatures of the <br>
dependencies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppi -k&rsquo;COMMAND ARCH
SORTED_DEPS DEP_SIGS ENV_{DEP,VAL}S&rsquo; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">architecture_independent <br>
The &quot;architecture_independent&quot; method is the same
as &quot;exact_match&quot; except that it does not check the
architecture. This can be useful for
architecture-independent files, <br>
that don&rsquo;t need to be rebuilt when you switch to a
different architecture. For example, you probably
don&rsquo;t need to rerun &quot;bison&quot; on Solaris if
you already ran it on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;architecture_independent&quot; method is best used by
specifying it using the &quot;:build_check
architecture_independent&quot; modifier to the each rule
that produces architecture <br>
independent files. Makepp by default never assumes any files
are architecture independent, because even .c files can be
architecture dependent. For example, the output of <br>
Solaris lex will not compile under Linux, or at least it
wouldn&rsquo;t last time I tried. So you must manually
specify this build check method for any files which are
truly <br>
architecture-independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concretely, a file will not be
rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or build cache,
if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
the signatures of the <br>
dependencies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppi -k&rsquo;COMMAND
SORTED_DEPS DEP_SIGS ENV_{DEP,VAL}S&rsquo; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_action <br>
The &quot;ignore_action&quot; method is the same as
&quot;exact_match&quot; except that it does not check the
action string (the command). Sometimes a command can change
and you don&rsquo;t want to <br>
force a rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you might want to
explicitly put a date into your command to log when the
build was done, but you don&rsquo;t want to force a rebuild
every time the command is <br>
executed. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILD_DATE := $(shell date)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my_program : $(MODULES).o <br>
$(CXX) $(inputs) -DBUILD_DATE=&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will compile date_stamp.c
with the last build date stamp, but won&rsquo;t force a
recompile when the date changes. Unfortunately, if something
else about the link command <br>
changes (e.g., you change linker options), it also
won&rsquo;t trigger a rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is also useful in
conjunction with the $(changed_inputs) or $? variable for
actions that merely update a target, rather than rebuilding
it from scratch. For example, <br>
you could update a .a file like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libmine.a : *.o : build_check
ignore_action <br>
$(AR) ru $(output) $(changed_inputs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will still mostly work if
you forget to specify the &quot;: build_check
ignore_action&quot;. However, suppose that none of the .o
files have changed. The command will now be <br>
&quot;ar ru libmine.a&quot; which is probably different from
what it was last time (e.g., &quot;ar ru libmine.a
buggy_module.o&quot;), so makepp will run the command. In
this case, the command <br>
won&rsquo;t do anything except waste time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building .a files like this is
discouraged, because it can leave stale .o files inside the
archive. If you delete a source file, the .o file is still
inside the .a file, and <br>
this can lead to incorrect builds. It&rsquo;s better to
build a .a file like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libmine.a : *.o <br>
&amp;rm $(output) <br>
$(AR) ru $(output) $(inputs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concretely, a file will not be
rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or build cache,
if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
the signatures of the <br>
dependencies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppi -k&rsquo;ARCH SORTED_DEPS
DEP_SIGS ENV_{DEP,VAL}S&rsquo; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_newer <br>
The &quot;target_newer&quot; method looks only at the file
date. If any dependency is more recent than the target, the
target is rebuilt. This is the algorithm that the
traditional <br>
Unix make utility uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;target_newer&quot;
method isn&rsquo;t as safe as the &quot;exact_match&quot;
method because it won&rsquo;t trigger a rebuild if you
change the build command, or if you replace a file with an
older <br>
version. Sometimes also it can get confused if clocks are
not properly synchronized. For example, if a file somehow
gets a date of June 4, 2048, then between now and 2048, <br>
every file that depends on that file will be rebuilt even
though the file doesn&rsquo;t change. Also switching to a
different architecture won&rsquo;t trigger a rebuild. It
prevents <br>
fetching a rule&rsquo;s target from a build cache, because
there is no unique signature that can be associated to the
endless set of pairs fulfilling the relationship newer
than.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But there are a few cases where
you may want to use the &quot;target_newer&quot; method:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When it is
reasonable for a user to build a file outside of the control
of makepp. Perhaps the most common example are the commands
that generate the makefile itself, <br>
i.e., the autoconfigure procedure. Users commonly issue the
configure command manually, but makefiles often have a way
to update themselves automatically. In this case, <br>
we don&rsquo;t want to force the makefile to rebuild itself
if the user typed the command in manually, so the
&quot;target_newer&quot; method is more appropriate than the
&quot;exact_match&quot; <br>
method. In fact, if makepp is trying to build a makefile, it
makes &quot;target_newer&quot; the default method until it
has finished building the makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When it is
reasonable for a user to modify a file after makepp has
built it. For example, if a file does not exist, you may
want to copy it from a central location, or <br>
check it out from a repository; but the user should be
allowed to modify it. If you use the default
&quot;exact_match&quot; build check method, makepp will
detect that the user <br>
has changed the file and so it will force a fresh copy from
the central location or a fresh checkout, wiping out the
user&rsquo;s changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to manually check
the timestamps, see makeppinfo examples for how to get the
path of each dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only_action <br>
The very specific &quot;only_action&quot; method will only
execute the action if the command string differs from the
last time it was executed. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(ROOT)/include/%.h : %.h <br>
&amp;ln -fr $(input) $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">publishes a file, but does not
repeat this when the file changes. Note that the &amp;ln
command is builtin and thus cheap, but makepp still has to
fork off and monitor a process <br>
to perform the whole action. So if you have lots of files to
publish, there is still a benefit. Actually we did not
specify the method, because, when the target is a <br>
symbolic link, this build check gets used automatically. You
only need to specify it for other commands that depend
solely on the command (which usually contains the names <br>
of the inputs):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.list : %.x : build_check
only_action <br>
&amp;echo $(inputs) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concretely, a file will not be
rebuilt, or can be fetched from repository or build cache,
if the following command output stays the same, i.e. matches
the signatures of the <br>
dependencies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppi -kCOMMAND file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other build check methods are
possible. You can write your own build check method by
creating a module &quot;Mpp::BuildCheck::MyMethod&quot;.
Read the documentation in Mpp/BuildCheck.pm <br>
in the makepp distribution. Most likely, you will want your
build check method to inherit from
&quot;Mpp::BuildCheck::exact_match&quot;, so read its
documentation too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s more commonly useful
modify the signature mechanism than to modify the build
check mechanism directly. Before you change the build check
mechanism, see if your problem is <br>
better served by changing signatures (see makepp_signatures
for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some reasons why a
custom build check method might be useful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you want
makepp to ignore part of the command. For example, if you
have commands in your makefile like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x.o : x.c <br>
ssh $(REMOTE_MACHINE) cc $&lt; -o $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you might want makepp not to
force a rebuild if &quot;$(REMOTE_MACHINE)&quot; changes.
You could modify the &quot;exact_match&quot; method so it
knows about ssh commands and ignores the machine <br>
name. Check :dispatch for another way to achieve that.</p>
