<p>GIT-HUB(1) Git Manual GIT-HUB(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-hub - Git command line interface to GitHub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git hub [global options] &lt;command&gt; [options]
[arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
git hub is a simple command line interface to github,
enabling most useful GitHub tasks (like creating and listing
pull request or issues) to be accessed directly through the
git <br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this command you&rsquo;ll
probably need to make an initial configuration to get
authorization from GitHub. To do this you can use the setup
command. See the CONFIGURATION sec&acirc; <br>
tion for more configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Show this help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show program&rsquo;s version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose (can be specified multiple times to get
extra verbosity)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent <br>
Be less verbose (can be specified multiple times to get less
verbosity)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
setup This command performs an initial setup to connect to
GitHub. It basically asks GitHub for an authorization token
and stores it in the Git configuration variable
hub.oauth&acirc; <br>
token for future use so you don&rsquo;t need to type your
password each time (or store it in the config). The username
is also stored for future use in the hub.username
vari&acirc; <br>
able. If the base URL is specified, it is stored in
hub.baseurl too. By default configuration is stored in the
repository&rsquo;s .git/config file (using git config). If
you <br>
want your configuration to be global to your user or
system-wide, use the --global or --system option
respectively. These options are passed straight to git
config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
<br>
GitHub&rsquo;s username (login name), will be stored in the
configuration variable hub.username. If an e-mail is
provided, then a username matching that e-mail will be <br>
searched and used instead, if found (for this to work the
e-mail must be part of the public profile).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
<br>
GitHub&rsquo;s password (will not be stored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b URL, --baseurl=URL <br>
GitHub&rsquo;s base URL to use to access the API. Set this
when you GitHub API is in another location other than the
default (Enterprise servers usually use <br>
https://host/api/v3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--global <br>
Store settings in the global configuration (see --global
option in git config(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system <br>
Store settings in the system configuration (see --system
option in git config(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clone REPO [DEST] <br>
This command is used to clone REPO, a GitHub repository, to
a DEST directory (defaults to the name of the project being
cloned). If the repository is specified in <br>
&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;project&gt; form, the REPO will be used as
upstream and a personal fork will be looked up. If none is
found, a new fork will be created. In both cases, the fork
will <br>
be cloned instead of the upstream repository. The REPO can
be specified as a regular clone URL too (http, ssh, git), in
that case the URL will be inspected and the <br>
hub.urltype will be set as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only &lt;project&gt; is
specified as REPO, then the configuration hub.username is
used as &lt;owner&gt;, and the parent repository is looked
up at GitHub to determine the real <br>
upstream repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upstream repository is also
added as a remote by the name upstream (unless --triangular
is used, in which case the remote is called fork by default)
and the <br>
hub.upstream configuration variable is set (see
CONFIGURATION), unless only &lt;project&gt; was used and the
resulting repository is not really a fork, in which case is
impossi&acirc; <br>
ble to automatically determine the upstream repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r NAME, --remote=NAME <br>
Use NAME as the upstream remote repository name instead of
the default (&rsquo;fork&rsquo; if --triangular is used,
&rsquo;upstream&rsquo; otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --triangular <br>
Use Git&rsquo;s triangular workflow configuration. This
option clones from the parent/upstream repository instead of
cloning the fork, and adds the fork as a remote <br>
repository. Then sets the remote.pushdefault Git option and
hub.forkremote git-hub option to the fork.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of this having the
upstream repository used by default when you pull but using
your fork when you push, which is typically what you want
when using <br>
GitHub&rsquo;s pull requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Git version 1.8.3 or newer is
needed to use this option (and 1.8.4 or newer is recommended
due to some issues in 1.8.3 related to this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option might become the
default in the future. To make it the default you can set
the option hub.triangular. See CONFIGURATION for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT CLONE OPTIONS <br>
Any standard git clone option can be passed. Not all of them
might make sense when cloning a GitHub repo to be used with
this tool though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">issue This command is used to
manage GitHub issues through a set of subcommands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list Show a list of open
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --closed <br>
Show closed issues instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --created-by-me <br>
Show only issues created by me</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --assigned-to-me <br>
Show only issues assigned to me</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show ISSUE [ISSUE ...] <br>
Show issues identified by ISSUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new Create a new issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
Issue title (and description). The first line is used as the
issue title and any text after an empty line is used as the
optional body. If this option is <br>
not used, the default GIT_EDITOR is opened to write one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l LABEL, --label=LABEL <br>
Attach LABEL to the issue (can be specified multiple times
to set multiple labels).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a USER, --assign=USER <br>
Assign a user to the issue. USER must be a valid GitHub
login name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M ID, --milestone=ID <br>
Assign the milestone identified by the number ID to the
issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update ISSUE <br>
Similar to new but update an existing issue identified by
ISSUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A convenient shortcut to close
an issue is provided by the close subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
New issue title (and description). The first line is used as
the issue title and any text after an empty line is used as
the optional body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit-message <br>
Open the default GIT_EDITOR to edit the current title (and
description) of the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --open <br>
Reopen the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --close <br>
Close the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l LABEL, --label=LABEL <br>
If one or more labels are specified, they will replace the
current issue labels. Otherwise the labels are unchanged. If
one of the labels is empty, the <br>
labels will be cleared (so you can use -l&rsquo;&rsquo; to
clear the labels of an issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a USER, --assign=USER <br>
Assign a user to the issue. USER must be a valid GitHub
login name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M ID, --milestone=ID <br>
Assign the milestone identified by the number ID to the
issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment ISSUE <br>
Add a new comment to an existing issue identified by
ISSUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
Comment to be added to the issue. If this option is not
used, the default GIT_EDITOR is opened to write the
comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close ISSUE <br>
Alias for update --close. (+ comment if --message or
--edit-message is specified). Closes issue identified by
ISSUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
Add a comment to the issue before closing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit-message <br>
Open the default GIT_EDITOR to write a comment to be added
to the issue before closing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull This command is used to
manage GitHub pull requests. Since pull requests in GitHub
are also issues, most of the subcommands are repeated from
the issue command for conve&acirc; <br>
nience. Only the list and new commands are really different,
and attach and rebase are added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list Show a list of open pull
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--closed <br>
Show closed pull requests instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show PULL [PULL ...] <br>
Alias for issue show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkout PULL ... <br>
Checkout the remote branch (head) of the pull request. This
command first fetches the head reference from the pull
request and then calls the standard git checkout <br>
command and any extra argument will be passed to git
checkout as-is, after the reference that was just fetched.
Remember this creates a detached checkout by <br>
default, use -b if you want to create a new branch based on
the pull request. Please take a look at git checkout help
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new [HEAD] <br>
Create a new pull request. If HEAD is specified, it will be
used as the branch (or git ref) where your changes are
implemented. Otherwise the current branch is <br>
used. If the branch used as head is not pushed to your fork
remote, a push will be automatically done before creating
the pull request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The repository to issue the pull
request from is taken from the hub.forkrepo configuration,
which defaults to hub.username/&lt;hub.upstream project
part&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
Pull request title (and description). The first line is used
as the pull request title and any text after an empty line
is used as the optional body. If <br>
this option is not used, the default GIT_EDITOR is opened.
If the HEAD branch have a proper description (see git branch
--edit-description), that descrip&acirc; <br>
tion will be used as the default message in the editor and
if not, the message of the last commit will be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b BASE, --base=BASE <br>
Branch (or git ref) you want your changes pulled into. By
default the tracking branch (branch.&lt;ref&gt;.merge
configuration variable) is used or the configura&acirc; <br>
tion hub.pullbase if not tracking a remote branch. If none
is present, it defaults to master. The repository to use as
the base is taken from the <br>
hub.upstream configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c NAME, --create-branch=NAME
<br>
Create a new remote branch with (with name NAME) as the real
head for the pull request instead of using the HEAD name
passed as HEAD. This is useful to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a pull request for a hot-fix you committed to your
regular HEAD without creating a branch first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force-push <br>
Force the push operations. Use with care!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attach ISSUE [HEAD] <br>
Convert the issue identified by ISSUE to a pull request by
attaching commits to it. The branch (or git ref) where your
changes are implemented can be optionally <br>
specified with HEAD (otherwise the current branch is used).
This subcommand is very similar to the new subcommand,
please refer to it for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note you can only attach
commits to issues if you have commit access to the
repository or if you are assigned to the issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
Add a comment to the issue/new pull request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit-message <br>
Open the default GIT_EDITOR to write a comment to be added
to the issue/new pull request. The default message is taken
from the --message option if present, <br>
otherwise the branch description or the first commit message
is used as with the new subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b BASE, --base=BASE <br>
Base branch to which issue the pull request. If this option
is not present, then the base branch is taken from the
configuration hub.pullbase (or just master <br>
if that configuration is not present either). The repository
to use as the base is taken from the hub.upstream
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c NAME, --create-branch=NAME
<br>
Create a new remote branch with (with name NAME) as the real
head for the pull request instead of using the HEAD name
passed as HEAD. This is useful to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a pull request for a hot-fix you committed to your
regular HEAD without creating a branch first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force-push <br>
Force the push operations. Use with care!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebase PULL <br>
Close a pull request identified by PULL by rebasing its base
branch (specified in the pull request) instead of merging as
GitHub&rsquo;s Merge Button&acirc;&cent; would do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the operation is successful,
a comment will be posted informing the new HEAD commit of
the branch that has been rebased and the pull request will
be closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of URL used to fetch
and push can be specified through the hub.pullurltype
configuration variable (see CONFIGURATION for more details).
Your working copy <br>
should stay the same ideally, if everything went OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operations performed by this
subcommand are roughly these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. git stash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. git fetch pullhead</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. git checkout -b tmp
FETCH_HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. git pull --rebase
pullbase</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. git push pullbase</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. git checkout oldhead</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. git branch -D tmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. git stash pop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If hub.forcerebase is set to
&quot;true&quot; (the default), --force will be passed to
rebase (not to be confused with this command option
--force-push which will force the <br>
push), otherwise (if is &quot;false&quot;) a regular rebase
is performed. When the rebase is forced, all the commits in
the pull request are re-committed, so the Committer <br>
and CommitterDate metadata is updated in the commits,
showing the person that performed the rebase and the time of
the rebase instead of the original values, so <br>
providing more useful information. As a side effect, the
hashes of the commits will change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If conflicts are found, the
command is interrupted, similarly to how git rebase would
do. The user should either --abort the rebasing, --skip the
conflicting commit <br>
or resolve the conflict and --continue. When using one of
these actions, you have to omit the PULL argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m MSG, --message=MSG <br>
Use this message for the comment instead of the default.
Specify an empty message (-m&rsquo;&rsquo;) to completely
omit the comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit-message <br>
Open the default GIT_EDITOR to write the comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-push <br>
Force the push operations. Use with care!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pause <br>
Pause the rebase just before the results are pushed and the
issue is merged. To resume the pull request rebasing (push
the changes upstream and close the <br>
issue), just use the --continue action. This is particularly
useful for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --stash-include-untracked
<br>
Passes the --include-untracked option to stash. If used all
untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with
git clean, leaving the working direc&acirc; <br>
tory in a very clean state, which avoid conflicts when
checking out the pull request to rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --stash-all <br>
Passes the --all option to stash. Is like
--stash-include-untracked but the ignored files are stashed
and cleaned in addition to the untracked files, which <br>
completely removes the possibility of conflicts when
checking out the pull request to rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delete-branch <br>
Delete the pull request branch if the rebase was successful.
This is similar to press the &quot;Delete Branch&quot;
Button (TM) in the web interface after merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--continue <br>
Continue an ongoing rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Abort an ongoing rebase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip Skip current patch in an
ongoing rebase and continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update PULL <br>
Alias for issue update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment PULL <br>
Alias for issue comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close PULL <br>
Alias for issue close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
This program use the git configuration facilities to get its
configuration from. These are the git config keys used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.username <br>
Your GitHub username. [default: current OS username]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.oauthtoken required <br>
This is the authorization token obtained via the setup
command. Even when required, you shouldn&rsquo;t need to set
this variable manually. Use the setup command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.upstream required <br>
Blessed repository used to get the issues from and make the
pull requests to. The format is
&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;project&gt;. This option can be
automatically set by the clone command <br>
and is not really required by it or the setup command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.forkrepo <br>
Your blessed repository fork. The format is
&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;project&gt;. Used to set the head for your
pull requests. [default: &lt;username&gt;/(upstream
&lt;project&gt; part)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.forkremote <br>
Remote name for accessing your fork. Used to push branches
before creating a pull request. [default: origin]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.pullbase <br>
Default remote branch (or git reference) you want your
changes pulled into when creating a pull request. [default:
master]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.urltype <br>
Type of URL to use when an URL from a GitHub API is needed
(for example, when &rsquo;pull rebase&rsquo; is used). At
the time of writing it could be ssh_url or clone_url for
HTTP). <br>
See GitHub&rsquo;s API documentation[1] for more details or
options. [default: ssh_url]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.baseurl <br>
GitHub&rsquo;s base URL to use to access the API. Set this
when you GitHub API is in another location other than the
default (Enterprise servers usually use <br>
https://host/api/v3). This will be prepended to all GitHub
API calls and it has to be a full URL, not just something
like &quot;www.example.com/api/v3/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.forcerebase <br>
If is set to &quot;true&quot;, --force will be passed to
rebase. If is set to &quot;false&quot; a regular rebase is
performed. See the pull rebase command for details.
[default: true]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hub.triangular <br>
Makes --triangular for clone if set to &quot;true&quot;
(boolean value). See clone documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1]
https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#get-a-single-pull-request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
This program creates some temporary files in the
&rsquo;.git&rsquo; directory during its operation. The
contents of these files can be used for debugging/recovery
purposes if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HUB_EDITMSG <br>
This file is used to take input from the user, e.g. issue
comments, pull request title &amp; description etc. If,
after accepting user input, the command given by the user
<br>
fails for some reason, then the entered text can still be
retrieved from this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HUB_PULL_REBASING <br>
This file is used to store various metadata information
related to a rebase operation (with the primary aim of being
able to rollback the repository to its original state <br>
if the rebase fails or is interrupted due to conflicts). The
sole presence of this file indicates that a rebase is in
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIM SYNTAX HIGHLIGHT <br>
A VIM ftdetect plugin is provided, to enable it you have to
follow some steps though. All you need to do is copy (or
preferably make a symbolic link) the script to
~/.vim/ftde&acirc; <br>
tect/githubmsg.vim:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetect <br>
ln -s /usr/share/vim/addons/githubmsg.vim ~/.vim/ftdetect/
<br>
# or if you are copying from the sources: <br>
# ln -s ftdetect.vim ~/.vim/ftdetect/githubmsg.vim</p>
