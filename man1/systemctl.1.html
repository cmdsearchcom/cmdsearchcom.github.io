<p>SYSTEMCTL(1) systemctl SYSTEMCTL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
systemctl - Control the systemd system and service
manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
systemctl [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [NAME...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
systemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of
the &quot;systemd&quot; system and service manager. Please
refer to systemd(1) for an introduction into the basic
concepts and <br>
functionality this tool manages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --type= <br>
The argument should be a comma-separated list of unit types
such as service and socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the arguments is a
unit type, when listing units, limit display to certain unit
types. Otherwise, units of all types will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, if one of the
arguments is help, a list of allowed values will be printed
and the program will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--state= <br>
The argument should be a comma-separated list of unit LOAD,
SUB, or ACTIVE states. When listing units, show only those
in specified states. Use --state=failed to show only <br>
failed units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --property= <br>
When showing unit/job/manager properties with the show
command, limit display to properties specified in the
argument. The argument should be a comma-separated list of
<br>
property names, such as &quot;MainPID&quot;. Unless
specified, all known properties are shown. If specified more
than once, all properties with the specified names are
shown. Shell <br>
completion is implemented for property names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the manager itself,
systemctl show will show all available properties. Those
properties are documented in systemd-system.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Properties for units vary by
unit type, so showing any unit (even a non-existent one) is
a way to list properties pertaining to this type. Similarly
showing any job will list <br>
properties pertaining to all jobs. Properties for units are
documented in systemd.unit(5), and the pages for individual
unit types systemd.service(5), systemd.socket(5), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
When listing units, show all loaded units, regardless of
their state, including inactive units. When showing
unit/job/manager properties, show all properties regardless
<br>
whether they are set or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list all units installed on
the system, use the list-unit-files command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recursive <br>
When listing units, also show units of local containers.
Units of local containers will be prefixed with the
container name, separated by a single colon character
(&quot;:&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reverse <br>
Show reverse dependencies between units with
list-dependencies, i.e. follow dependencies of type
WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, RequiredByOverrridable=, PartOf=,
BoundBy=, instead <br>
of Wants= and similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--after <br>
With list-dependencies, show the units that are ordered
before the specified unit. In other words, recursively list
units following the After= dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that any After= dependency
is automatically mirrored to create a Before= dependency.
Temporal dependencies may be specified explicitly, but are
also created implicitly <br>
for units which are WantedBy= targets (see
systemd.target(5)), and as a result of other directives (for
example RequiresMountsFor=). Both explicitly and implicitly
introduced <br>
dependencies are shown with list-dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--before <br>
With list-dependencies, show the units that are ordered
after the specified unit. In other words, recursively list
units following the Before= dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --full <br>
Do not ellipsize unit names, process tree entries, journal
output, or truncate unit descriptions in the output of
status, list-units, list-jobs, and list-timers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-types <br>
When showing sockets, show the type of the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--job-mode= <br>
When queuing a new job, this option controls how to deal
with already queued jobs. It takes one of &quot;fail&quot;,
&quot;replace&quot;, &quot;replace-irreversibly&quot;,
&quot;isolate&quot;, <br>
&quot;ignore-dependencies&quot;,
&quot;ignore-requirements&quot; or &quot;flush&quot;.
Defaults to &quot;replace&quot;, except when the isolate
command is used which implies the &quot;isolate&quot; job
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;fail&quot; is specified
and a requested operation conflicts with a pending job (more
specifically: causes an already pending start job to be
reversed into a stop job or vice <br>
versa), cause the operation to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;replace&quot; (the
default) is specified, any conflicting pending job will be
replaced, as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace-irreversibly&quot; is specified, operate like
&quot;replace&quot;, but also mark the new jobs as
irreversible. This prevents future conflicting transactions
from replacing these <br>
jobs (or even being enqueued while the irreversible jobs are
still pending). Irreversible jobs can still be cancelled
using the cancel command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;isolate&quot; is only
valid for start operations and causes all other units to be
stopped when the specified unit is started. This mode is
always used when the isolate command is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;flush&quot; will cause all
queued jobs to be canceled when the new job is enqueued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;ignore-dependencies&quot; is specified, then all unit
dependencies are ignored for this new job and the operation
is executed immediately. If passed, no required units of the
<br>
unit passed will be pulled in, and no ordering dependencies
will be honored. This is mostly a debugging and rescue tool
for the administrator and should not be used by <br>
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ignore-requirements&quot;
is similar to &quot;ignore-dependencies&quot;, but only
causes the requirement dependencies to be ignored, the
ordering dependencies will still be honoured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-inhibitors <br>
When system shutdown or a sleep state is requested, ignore
inhibitor locks. Applications can establish inhibitor locks
to avoid that certain important operations (such as CD <br>
burning or suchlike) are interrupted by system shutdown or a
sleep state. Any user may take these locks and privileged
users may override these locks. If any locks are taken, <br>
shutdown and sleep state requests will normally fail
(regardless of whether privileged or not) and a list of
active locks is printed. However, if --ignore-inhibitors is
<br>
specified, the locks are ignored and not printed, and the
operation attempted anyway, possibly requiring additional
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress output to standard output in snapshot, is-active,
is-failed, is-enabled, is-system-running, enable and
disable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-block <br>
Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to
finish. If this is not specified, the job will be verified,
enqueued and systemctl will wait until it is completed. <br>
By passing this argument, it is only verified and
enqueued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system <br>
Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the
implied default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-wall <br>
Do not send wall message before halt, power-off, reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-reload <br>
When used with enable and disable, do not implicitly reload
daemon configuration after executing the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ask-password <br>
When used with start and related commands, disables asking
for passwords. Background services may require input of a
password or passphrase string, for example to unlock <br>
system hard disks or cryptographic certificates. Unless this
option is specified and the command is invoked from a
terminal, systemctl will query the user on the terminal for
<br>
the necessary secrets. Use this option to switch this
behavior off. In this case, the password must be supplied by
some other means (for example graphical password agents) or
<br>
the service might fail. This also disables querying the user
for authentication for privileged operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kill-who= <br>
When used with kill, choose which processes to send a signal
to. Must be one of main, control or all to select whether to
kill only the main process, the control process or <br>
all processes of the unit. The main process of the unit is
the one that defines the life-time of it. A control process
of a unit is one that is invoked by the manager to <br>
induce state changes of it. For example, all processes
started due to the ExecStartPre=, ExecStop= or ExecReload=
settings of service units are control processes. Note that
<br>
there is only one control process per unit at a time, as
only one state change is executed at a time. For services of
type Type=forking, the initial process started by the <br>
manager for ExecStart= is a control process, while the
process ultimately forked off by that one is then considered
the main process of the unit (if it can be determined). <br>
This is different for service units of other types, where
the process forked off by the manager for ExecStart= is
always the main process itself. A service unit consists of
<br>
zero or one main process, zero or one control process plus
any number of additional processes. Not all unit types
manage processes of these types however. For example, for
<br>
mount units, control processes are defined (which are the
invocations of /usr/bin/mount and /usr/bin/umount), but no
main process is defined. If omitted, defaults to all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --signal= <br>
When used with kill, choose which signal to send to selected
processes. Must be one of the well known signal specifiers
such as SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGSTOP. If omitted, <br>
defaults to SIGTERM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
When used with enable, overwrite any existing conflicting
symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with halt, poweroff,
reboot or kexec, execute the selected operation without
shutting down all units. However, all processes will be
killed forcibly and all file <br>
systems are unmounted or remounted read-only. This is hence
a drastic but relatively safe option to request an immediate
reboot. If --force is specified twice for these <br>
operations, they will be executed immediately without
terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems.
Warning: specifying --force twice with any of these
operations <br>
might result in data loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--now <br>
When used with enable, the units will also be started. When
used with disable or mask, the units will also be stopped.
The start or stop operation is only carried out when <br>
the respective enable or disable operation has been
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root= <br>
When used with enable/disable/is-enabled (and related
commands), use alternative root path when looking for unit
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--runtime <br>
When used with enable, disable, edit, (and related
commands), make changes only temporarily, so that they are
lost on the next reboot. This will have the effect that
changes <br>
are not made in subdirectories of /etc but in /run, with
identical immediate effects, however, since the latter is
lost on reboot, the changes are lost too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, when used with
set-property, make changes only temporarily, so that they
are lost on the next reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preset-mode= <br>
Takes one of &quot;full&quot; (the default),
&quot;enable-only&quot;, &quot;disable-only&quot;. When used
with the preset or preset-all commands, controls whether
units shall be disabled and enabled <br>
according to the preset rules, or only enabled, or only
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --lines= <br>
When used with status, controls the number of journal lines
to show, counting from the most recent ones. Takes a
positive integer argument. Defaults to 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output= <br>
When used with status, controls the formatting of the
journal entries that are shown. For the available choices,
see journalctl(1). Defaults to &quot;short&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--plain <br>
When used with list-dependencies, the output is printed as a
list instead of a tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --host= <br>
Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
username and hostname separated by &quot;@&quot;, to connect
to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a container
name, <br>
separated by &quot;:&quot;, which connects directly to a
specific container on the specified host. This will use SSH
to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container
names may <br>
be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --machine= <br>
Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
name to connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pager <br>
Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-legend <br>
Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
with hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print a short version string and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unit Commands <br>
list-units [PATTERN...] <br>
List known units (subject to limitations specified with -t).
If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching
one of them are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-sockets [PATTERN...] <br>
List socket units ordered by listening address. If one or
more PATTERNs are specified, only socket units matching one
of them are shown. Produces output similar to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTEN UNIT ACTIVATES <br>
/dev/initctl systemd-initctl.socket systemd-initctl.service
<br>
... <br>
[::]:22 sshd.socket sshd.service <br>
kobject-uevent 1 systemd-udevd-kernel.socket
systemd-udevd.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 sockets listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: because the addresses
might contains spaces, this output is not suitable for
programmatic consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the options
--show-types, --all, and --state=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-timers [PATTERN...] <br>
List timer units ordered by the time they elapse next. If
one or more PATTERNs are specified, only units matching one
of them are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the options --all and
--state=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start PATTERN... <br>
Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that glob patterns operate
on a list of currently loaded units. Units which are not
active and are not in a failed state usually are not loaded,
and would not be matched <br>
by any pattern. In addition, in case of instantiated units,
systemd is often unaware of the instance name until the
instance has been started. Therefore, using glob patterns
<br>
with start has limited usefulness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop PATTERN... <br>
Stop (deactivate) one or more units specified on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload PATTERN... <br>
Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their
configuration. Note that this will reload the
service-specific configuration, not the unit configuration
file of <br>
systemd. If you want systemd to reload the configuration
file of a unit, use the daemon-reload command. In other
words: for the example case of Apache, this will reload <br>
Apache&rsquo;s httpd.conf in the web server, not the
apache.service systemd unit file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command should not be
confused with the daemon-reload command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart PATTERN... <br>
Restart one or more units specified on the command line. If
the units are not running yet, they will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">try-restart PATTERN... <br>
Restart one or more units specified on the command line if
the units are running. This does nothing if units are not
running. Note that, for compatibility with Red Hat init <br>
scripts, condrestart is equivalent to this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload-or-restart PATTERN...
<br>
Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, restart
them instead. If the units are not running yet, they will be
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload-or-try-restart PATTERN...
<br>
Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, restart
them instead. This does nothing if the units are not
running. Note that, for compatibility with SysV init <br>
scripts, force-reload is equivalent to this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isolate NAME <br>
Start the unit specified on the command line and its
dependencies and stop all others. If a unit name with no
extension is given, an extension of &quot;.target&quot; will
be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is similar to changing the
runlevel in a traditional init system. The isolate command
will immediately stop processes that are not enabled in the
new unit, possibly <br>
including the graphical environment or terminal you are
currently using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is allowed only
on units where AllowIsolate= is enabled. See systemd.unit(5)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill PATTERN... <br>
Send a signal to one or more processes of the unit. Use
--kill-who= to select which process to kill. Use --signal=
to select the signal to send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is-active PATTERN... <br>
Check whether any of the specified units are active (i.e.
running). Returns an exit code 0 if at least one is active,
or non-zero otherwise. Unless --quiet is specified, this
<br>
will also print the current unit state to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is-failed PATTERN... <br>
Check whether any of the specified units are in a
&quot;failed&quot; state. Returns an exit code 0 if at least
one has failed, non-zero otherwise. Unless --quiet is
specified, this <br>
will also print the current unit state to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status [PATTERN...|PID...]] <br>
Show terse runtime status information about one or more
units, followed by most recent log data from the journal. If
no units are specified, show system status. If combined <br>
with --all, also show the status of all units (subject to
limitations specified with -t). If a PID is passed, show
information about the unit the process belongs to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function is intended to
generate human-readable output. If you are looking for
computer-parsable output, use show instead. By default this
function only shows 10 lines <br>
of output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal
window. This can be changes with --lines and --full, see
above. In addition, journalctl --unit=NAME use a similar
filter <br>
for messages and might be more convenient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show [PATTERN...|JOB...] <br>
Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager
itself. If no argument is specified, properties of the
manager will be shown. If a unit name is specified, <br>
properties of the unit is shown, and if a job id is
specified, properties of the job is shown. By default, empty
properties are suppressed. Use --all to show those too. To
<br>
select specific properties to show, use --property=. This
command is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable
output is required. Use status if you are looking for <br>
formatted human-readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat PATTERN... <br>
Show backing files of one or more units. Prints the
&quot;fragment&quot; and &quot;drop-ins&quot; (source files)
of units. Each file is preceded by a comment which includes
the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-property NAME ASSIGNMENT...
<br>
Set the specified unit properties at runtime where this is
supported. This allows changing configuration parameter
properties such as resource control settings at runtime.
<br>
Not all properties may be changed at runtime, but many
resource control settings (primarily those in
systemd.resource-control(5)) may. The changes are applied
instantly, and <br>
stored on disk for future boots, unless --runtime is passed,
in which case the settings only apply until the next reboot.
The syntax of the property assignment follows <br>
closely the syntax of assignments in unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: systemctl set-property
foobar.service CPUShares=777</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this command allows
changing multiple properties at the same time, which is
preferable over setting them individually. Like unit file
configuration settings, <br>
assigning the empty list to list parameters will reset the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help PATTERN...|PID... <br>
Show manual pages for one or more units, if available. If a
PID is given, the manual pages for the unit the process
belongs to are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset-failed [PATTERN...] <br>
Reset the &quot;failed&quot; state of the specified units,
or if no unit name is passed, reset the state of all units.
When a unit fails in some way (i.e. process exiting with
non-zero <br>
error code, terminating abnormally or timing out), it will
automatically enter the &quot;failed&quot; state and its
exit code and status is recorded for introspection by the
<br>
administrator until the service is restarted or reset with
this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-dependencies [NAME] <br>
Shows units required and wanted by the specified unit. This
recursively lists units following the Requires=,
RequiresOverridable=, Requisite=, RequisiteOverridable=,
Wants=, <br>
BindsTo= dependencies. If no unit is specified,
default.target is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, only target units
are recursively expanded. When --all is passed, all other
units are recursively expanded as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options --reverse, --after,
--before may be used to change what types of dependencies
are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unit File Commands <br>
list-unit-files [PATTERN...] <br>
List installed unit files and their enablement state (as
reported by is-enabled). If one or more PATTERNs are
specified, only units whose filename (just the last
component of <br>
the path) matches one of them are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable NAME... <br>
Enable one or more unit files or unit file instances, as
specified on the command line. This will create a number of
symlinks as encoded in the &quot;[Install]&quot; sections of
the <br>
unit files. After the symlinks have been created, the
systemd configuration is reloaded (in a way that is
equivalent to daemon-reload) to ensure the changes are taken
into <br>
account immediately. Note that this does not have the effect
of also starting any of the units being enabled. If this is
desired, either --now should be used together with <br>
this command, or an additional start command must be invoked
for the unit. Also note that in case of instance enablement,
symlinks named the same as instances are created in <br>
the install location, however they all point to the same
template unit file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will print the
actions executed. This output may be suppressed by passing
--quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this operation creates
only the suggested symlinks for the units. While this
command is the recommended way to manipulate the unit
configuration directory, the <br>
administrator is free to make additional changes manually by
placing or removing symlinks in the directory. This is
particularly useful to create configurations that deviate
<br>
from the suggested default installation. In this case, the
administrator must make sure to invoke daemon-reload
manually as necessary to ensure the changes are taken into
<br>
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling units should not be
confused with starting (activating) units, as done by the
start command. Enabling and starting units is orthogonal:
units may be enabled without <br>
being started and started without being enabled. Enabling
simply hooks the unit into various suggested places (for
example, so that the unit is automatically started on boot
<br>
or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in).
Starting actually spawns the daemon process (in case of
service units), or binds the socket (in case of socket
units), <br>
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --runtime is specified, then
this enables the unit only this boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using enable on masked units
results in an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable NAME... <br>
Disables one or more units. This removes all symlinks to the
specified unit files from the unit configuration directory,
and hence undoes the changes made by enable. Note <br>
however that this removes all symlinks to the unit files
(i.e. including manual additions), not just those actually
created by enable. This call implicitly reloads the <br>
systemd daemon configuration after completing the disabling
of the units. Note that this command does not implicitly
stop the units that are being disabled. If this is <br>
desired, either --now should be used together with this
command, or an additional stop command should be executed
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will print the
actions executed. This output may be suppressed by passing
--quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command honors --runtime in
a similar way as enable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reenable NAME... <br>
Reenable one or more unit files, as specified on the command
line. This is a combination of disable and enable and is
useful to reset the symlinks a unit is enabled with to <br>
the defaults configured in the &quot;[Install]&quot; section
of the unit file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preset NAME... <br>
Reset the enable/disable status one or more unit files, as
specified on the command line, to the defaults configured in
the preset policy files. This has the same effect as <br>
disable or enable, depending how the unit is listed in the
preset files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use --preset-mode= to control
whether units shall be enabled and disabled, or only
enabled, or only disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the unit carries no install
information, it will be silently ignored by this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on the
preset policy format, see systemd.preset(5). For more
information on the concept of presets, please consult the
Preset[1] document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preset-all <br>
Resets all installed unit files to the defaults configured
in the preset policy file (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use --preset-mode= to control
whether units shall be enabled and disabled, or only
enabled, or only disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is-enabled NAME... <br>
Checks whether any of the specified unit files are enabled
(as with enable). Returns an exit code of 0 if at least one
is enabled, non-zero otherwise. Prints the current <br>
enable status (see table). To suppress this output, use
--quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mask NAME... <br>
Mask one or more unit files, as specified on the command
line. This will link these units to /dev/null, making it
impossible to start them. This is a stronger version of <br>
disable, since it prohibits all kinds of activation of the
unit, including enablement and manual activation. Use this
option with care. This honors the --runtime option to <br>
only mask temporarily until the next reboot of the system.
The --now option can be used to ensure that the units are
also stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmask NAME... <br>
Unmask one or more unit files, as specified on the command
line. This will undo the effect of mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link FILENAME... <br>
Link a unit file that is not in the unit file search paths
into the unit file search path. This requires an absolute
path to a unit file. The effect of this can be undone <br>
with disable. The effect of this command is that a unit file
is available for start and other commands although it is not
installed directly in the unit search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add-wants TARGET NAME...,
add-requires TARGET NAME... <br>
Adds &quot;Wants=&quot; resp. &quot;Requires=&quot;
dependency to the specified TARGET for one or more
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command honors --runtime in
a similar way as enable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit NAME... <br>
Edit a drop-in snippet or a whole replacement file if --full
is specified, to extend or override the specified unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This creates a drop-in file for
a unit. Then, the editor (see the &quot;Environment&quot;
section below) is invoked on temporary files which will be
written to the real location if the <br>
editor exits successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --full is specified, this
will copy the original units instead of creating drop-in
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --runtime is specified, the
changes will be made temporarily in /run and they will be
lost on the next reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the temporary file is empty
upon exit the modification of the related unit is
canceled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the units have been
edited, systemd configuration is reloaded (in a way that is
equivalent to daemon-reload).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this command cannot be
used to remotely edit units and that you cannot temporarily
edit units which are in /etc since they take precedence over
/run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-default <br>
Return the default target to boot into. This returns the
target unit name default.target is aliased (symlinked)
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-default NAME <br>
Set the default target to boot into. This sets (symlinks)
the default.target alias to the given target unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine Commands <br>
list-machines [PATTERN...] <br>
List the host and all running local containers with their
state. If one or more PATTERNs are specified, only
containers matching one of them are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job Commands <br>
list-jobs [PATTERN...] <br>
List jobs that are in progress. If one or more PATTERNs are
specified, only jobs for units matching one of them are
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cancel JOB... <br>
Cancel one or more jobs specified on the command line by
their numeric job IDs. If no job ID is specified, cancel all
pending jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snapshot Commands <br>
snapshot [NAME] <br>
Create a snapshot. If a snapshot name is specified, the new
snapshot will be named after it. If none is specified, an
automatic snapshot name is generated. In either case, <br>
the snapshot name used is printed to standard output, unless
--quiet is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A snapshot refers to a saved
state of the systemd manager. It is implemented itself as a
unit that is generated dynamically with this command and has
dependencies on all <br>
units active at the time. At a later time, the user may
return to this state by using the isolate command on the
snapshot unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snapshots are only useful for
saving and restoring which units are running or are stopped,
they do not save/restore any other state. Snapshots are
dynamic and lost on reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete PATTERN... <br>
Remove a snapshot previously created with snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment Commands <br>
show-environment <br>
Dump the systemd manager environment block. The environment
block will be dumped in straight-forward form suitable for
sourcing into a shell script. This environment block <br>
will be passed to all processes the manager spawns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-environment
VARIABLE=VALUE... <br>
Set one or more systemd manager environment variables, as
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset-environment VARIABLE...
<br>
Unset one or more systemd manager environment variables. If
only a variable name is specified, it will be removed
regardless of its value. If a variable and a value are <br>
specified, the variable is only removed if it has the
specified value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import-environment [VARIABLE...]
<br>
Import all, one or more environment variables set on the
client into the systemd manager environment block. If no
arguments are passed, the entire environment block is <br>
imported. Otherwise, a list of one or more environment
variable names should be passed, whose client-side values
are then imported into the manager&rsquo;s environment
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manager Lifecycle Commands <br>
daemon-reload <br>
Reload systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all
generators (see systemd.generator(7)), reload all unit
files, and recreate the entire dependency tree. While the
<br>
daemon is being reloaded, all sockets systemd listens on
behalf of user configuration will stay accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command should not be
confused with the reload command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daemon-reexec <br>
Reexecute the systemd manager. This will serialize the
manager state, reexecute the process and deserialize the
state again. This command is of little use except for <br>
debugging and package upgrades. Sometimes, it might be
helpful as a heavy-weight daemon-reload. While the daemon is
being reexecuted, all sockets systemd listening on behalf
<br>
of user configuration will stay accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System Commands <br>
is-system-running <br>
Checks whether the system is operational. This returns
success when the system is fully up and running, meaning not
in startup, shutdown or maintenance mode. Failure is <br>
returned otherwise. In addition, the current state is
printed in a short string to standard output, see table
below. Use --quiet to suppress this output.</p>

<br>
&acirc;stopping &acirc; The manager is shutting down.
&acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acute;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
Enter default mode. This is mostly equivalent to isolate
default.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rescue <br>
Enter rescue mode. This is mostly equivalent to isolate
rescue.target, but also prints a wall message to all
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emergency <br>
Enter emergency mode. This is mostly equivalent to isolate
emergency.target, but also prints a wall message to all
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halt <br>
Shut down and halt the system. This is mostly equivalent to
start halt.target --irreversible, but also prints a wall
message to all users. If combined with --force, shutdown
<br>
of all running services is skipped, however all processes
are killed and all file systems are unmounted or mounted
read-only, immediately followed by the system halt. If <br>
--force is specified twice, the operation is immediately
executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any
file systems. This may result in data loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">poweroff <br>
Shut down and power-off the system. This is mostly
equivalent to start poweroff.target --irreversible, but also
prints a wall message to all users. If combined with
--force, <br>
shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all
processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or
mounted read-only, immediately followed by the powering <br>
off. If --force is specified twice, the operation is
immediately executed without terminating any processes or
unmounting any file systems. This may result in data
loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reboot [arg] <br>
Shut down and reboot the system. This is mostly equivalent
to start reboot.target --irreversible, but also prints a
wall message to all users. If combined with --force, <br>
shutdown of all running services is skipped, however all
processes are killed and all file systems are unmounted or
mounted read-only, immediately followed by the reboot. If
<br>
--force is specified twice, the operation is immediately
executed without terminating any processes or unmounting any
file systems. This may result in data loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional argument arg is
given, it will be passed as the optional argument to the
reboot(2) system call. The value is architecture and
firmware specific. As an <br>
example, &quot;recovery&quot; might be used to trigger
system recovery, and &quot;fota&quot; might be used to
trigger a &acirc;firmware over the air&acirc; update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kexec <br>
Shut down and reboot the system via kexec. This is mostly
equivalent to start kexec.target --irreversible, but also
prints a wall message to all users. If combined with <br>
--force, shutdown of all running services is skipped,
however all processes are killed and all file systems are
unmounted or mounted read-only, immediately followed by the
<br>
reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch-root ROOT [INIT] <br>
Switches to a different root directory and executes a new
system manager process below it. This is intended for usage
in initial RAM disks (&quot;initrd&quot;), and will
transition <br>
from the initrd&rsquo;s system manager process (a.k.a
&quot;init&quot; process) to the main system manager
process. This call takes two arguments: the directory that
is to become the new <br>
root directory, and the path to the new system manager
binary below it to execute as PID 1. If the latter is
omitted or the empty string, a systemd binary will
automatically <br>
be searched for and used as init. If the system manager path
is omitted or equal to the empty string, the state of the
initrd&rsquo;s system manager process is passed to the main
<br>
system manager, which allows later introspection of the
state of the services involved in the initrd boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend <br>
Suspend the system. This will trigger activation of the
special suspend.target target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hibernate <br>
Hibernate the system. This will trigger activation of the
special hibernate.target target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hybrid-sleep <br>
Hibernate and suspend the system. This will trigger
activation of the special hybrid-sleep.target target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameter Syntax <br>
Unit commands listed above take either a single unit name
(designated as NAME), or multiple unit specifications
(designated as PATTERN...). In the first case, the unit name
with <br>
or without a suffix must be given. If the suffix is not
specified, systemctl will append a suitable suffix,
&quot;.service&quot; by default, and a type-specific suffix
in case of commands <br>
which operate only on specific unit types. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl start sshd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl start
sshd.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are equivalent, as are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl isolate default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl isolate
default.target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that (absolute) paths to
device nodes are automatically converted to device unit
names, and other (absolute) paths to mount unit names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl status /dev/sda <br>
# systemctl status /home</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl status
dev-sda.device <br>
# systemctl status home.mount</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second case, shell-style
globs will be matched against currently loaded units;
literal unit names, with or without a suffix, will be
treated as in the first case. This <br>
means that literal unit names always refer to exactly one
unit, but globs may match zero units and this is not
considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glob patterns use fnmatch(3), so
normal shell-style globbing rules are used, and
&quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;[]&quot; may be used.
See glob(7) for more details. The patterns are matched
against the <br>
names of currently loaded units, and patterns which do not
match anything are silently skipped. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl stop
sshd@*.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will stop all sshd@.service
instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For unit file commands, the
specified NAME should be the full name of the unit file, or
the absolute path to the unit file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl enable
foo.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># systemctl link
/path/to/foo.service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
$SYSTEMD_EDITOR <br>
Editor to use when editing units; overrides $EDITOR and
$VISUAL. If neither $SYSTEMD_EDITOR nor $EDITOR nor $VISUAL
are present or if it is set to an empty string or if their
<br>
execution failed, systemctl will try to execute well known
editors in this order: nano(1), vim(1), vi(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_PAGER <br>
Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER.
Setting this to an empty string or the value &quot;cat&quot;
is equivalent to passing --no-pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_LESS <br>
Override the default options passed to less
(&quot;FRSXMK&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>

service and chkconfig command please see: Managing System
