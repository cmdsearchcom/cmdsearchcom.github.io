<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cups - a standards-based, open source printing system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
CUPS is the software you use to print from applications like
word processors, email readers, photo editors, and web
browsers. It converts the page descriptions produced by your
<br>
application (put a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so
forth) into something your printer can understand and then
sends the information to the printer for printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, since every printer
manufacturer does things differently, printing can be very
complicated. CUPS does its best to hide this from you and
your application so that you can <br>
concentrate on printing and less on how to print. Generally,
the only time you need to know anything about your printer
is when you use it for the first time, and even then CUPS
<br>
can often figure things out on its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW DOES IT WORK? <br>
The first time you print to a printer, CUPS creates a queue
to keep track of the current status of the printer
(everything OK, out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have
printed. <br>
Most of the time the queue points to a printer connected
directly to your computer via a USB port, however it can
also point to a printer on your network, a printer on the
Inter&acirc; <br>
net, or multiple printers depending on the configuration.
Regardless of where the queue points, it will look like any
other printer to you and your applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every time you print something,
CUPS creates a job which contains the queue you are sending
the print to, the name of the document you are printing, and
the page descriptions. <br>
Job are numbered (queue-1, queue-2, and so forth) so you can
monitor the job as it is printed or cancel it if you see a
mistake. When CUPS gets a job for printing, it determines
<br>
the best programs (filters, printer drivers, port monitors,
and backends) to convert the pages into a printable format
and then runs them to actually print the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the print job is completely
printed, CUPS removes the job from the queue and moves on to
any other jobs you have submitted. You can also be notified
when the job is fin&acirc; <br>
ished, or if there are any errors during printing, in
several different ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHERE DO I BEGIN? <br>
The easiest way to start is by using the web interface to
configure your printer. Go to
&quot;http://localhost:631&quot; and choose the
Administration tab at the top of the page. <br>
Click/press on the Add Printer button and follow the
prompts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are asked for a
username and password, enter your login username and
password or the &quot;root&quot; username and password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the printer is added you
will be asked to set the default printer options (paper
size, output mode, etc.) for the printer. Make any changes
as needed and then click/press <br>
on the Set Default Options button to save them. Some
printers also support auto-configuration - click/press on
the Query Printer for Default Options button to update the
options <br>
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have added the printer,
you can print to it from any application. You can also
choose Print Test Page from the maintenance menu to print a
simple test page and verify <br>
that everything is working properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the lpadmin(8)
and lpinfo(8) commands to add printers to CUPS.
Additionally, your operating system may include graphical
user interfaces or automatically create <br>
printer queues when you connect a printer to your
computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW DO I GET HELP? <br>
The CUPS web site (http://www.CUPS.org) provides access to
the cups and cups-devel mailing lists, additional
documentation and resources, and a bug report database. Most
vendors <br>
also provide online discussion forums to ask printing
questions for your operating system of choice.</p>
