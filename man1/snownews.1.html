<p>SNOWNEWS(1) Snownews 1.5.12 SNOWNEWS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
snownews - console RSS newsreader</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
snownews [-huV] [--help|--update|--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Snownews is a console RSS/RDF news reader. It supports all
versions of RSS natively and can be expanded via plugins to
support many other other formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main program screen, that is
shown right after you start snownews, lets you add/remove
feeds and update them manually. On the right side of the
screen the number of new items <br>
is shown for every newsfeed. To add a feed press
&rsquo;a&rsquo; and enter the URL. This can be either a
http:// or a feed:// URL. If you omit the protocol specifier
snownews asumes the HTTP <br>
protocol. To delete a listed feed highlight it with the
cursor keys and press &rsquo;D&rsquo;. A dialog will ask for
confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can navigate through the
main menu with up and down arrow keys or with
&rsquo;n&rsquo; and &rsquo;p&rsquo;. The keys page up/page
down, b/space and HOME/END, &lt;/&gt; will scroll a page up
or down and <br>
to the first or last entry respectively. Pressing
&rsquo;r&rsquo; reloads the highlighted feed from the
server, &rsquo;R&rsquo; updates all feeds in your list and
&rsquo;T&rsquo; refreshes the feed ignoring any <br>
cache control data. That means, even if the feed has not
been modified on the server, Snownews will still download
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will not sort this
list alphabetically by default. You can move items up and
down by pressing &rsquo;P&rsquo; and &rsquo;N&rsquo;. To
sort the feed list alphabetically, press
&rsquo;s&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you highlight a feed and hit
Enter the program will display every item for this feed.
Navigation in all sub menus works as usual. If you press
&rsquo;r&rsquo; the program will reload the <br>
current feed. Items may vanish from the list completely and
new newsitems will appear bold or in colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select an item and hit Enter to
read its description. If there is none attached to it the
text &quot;No description available.&quot; will be displayed
instead. You can use the arrow keys <br>
left and right, repectively &rsquo;p&rsquo; and
&rsquo;n&rsquo; to select the previous or next newsitem in
the list. Pressing &rsquo;o&rsquo; will open the link
(usually the complete news text) in the browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default browser is lynx, but
you can change this by pressing &rsquo;B&rsquo; in the main
menu and entering a new default browser. Or you can edit the
file ~/.snownews/browser. The pro&acirc; <br>
gram replaces %s with the URL when expanding the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can rename a feed by
pressing the key &rsquo;c&rsquo; and entering its new name.
To reset its name to the original title enter
&rsquo;-&rsquo; in this textfield.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A context help window is
available everytime by pressing &rsquo;h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type Ahead Find</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For faster navigation in your
feedlist you can use Snownews&rsquo; Type Ahead Find
feature. Press the TAB key and the statusline will change
into a text entry field. While you enter <br>
the text you want to search for, highlight will be
automatically placed on items as they match. If you have
selected an item just press enter to open the feed. If there
are mul&acirc; <br>
tiple items matching you can switch between them by pressing
TAB. To quit Type Ahead delete the search text or press
CTRL+G</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Categories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews uses categories to
manage large subscription lists. You can define as many
categories for a feed as you like. You can then apply a
filter in the main menu that will only <br>
show feeds that have a matching category defined. Feeds with
a category will have it printed next to their name in the
main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add or remove a feed from a
category, press &rsquo;C&rsquo; while the feed is
highlighted in the main menu. If you already have defined
categories for other feeds you&rsquo;ll get a list of the
<br>
existing categories. Just press its number to add the
current feed to this category. To add the feed to a new
category, press &rsquo;A&rsquo; and enter the name of the
new category. If you <br>
want to remove a feed from a category, just press its number
in the feed categorization GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can see all defined
categories for a feed in the feed info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customizing keybindings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can customize the
keybindings by editing the file ~/.snownews/keybindings. The
format is &quot;function description:key&quot;. Do not
change the string &quot;function description&quot;. The <br>
single character behind the colon represents the key the
program will associate with the corresponding function. If
you delete a definition or the program cannot parse the file
<br>
for some reason the default settings will be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colours</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you prefer to see the world
in colours you can enable (and configure) colour support in
Snownews. Edit the file ~/.snownews/colors. To globally
enable colours in the program, <br>
set enabled to &quot;1&quot;. To set a colour, use the
colour key value that is listed in the comment in that file.
You can disable usage for single items by using the value
&quot;-1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML conversion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews will try to convert
HTML content into plain text before displaying the text.
Tags will be stripped alltogether and some common HTML
entities will be translated. By <br>
default only the five entities defined in XML (&amp;lt;
(&lt;), &amp;gt; (&gt;), &amp;amp; (&amp;), &amp;quot;
(&quot;) and &amp;apos; (&rsquo;)) plus a default setting
included will be translated. You can influence <br>
this behaviour with the definition file at
~/.snownews/html_entities. See the comments on top of the
file for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing/exporting
subscriptions from other programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews can import opml
subscription files from other RSS readers into its own
format with the included program &quot;opml2snow&quot;. To
convert an opml subscription file type <br>
&quot;opml2snow MySubsriptions.opml&quot; with
MySubscriptions.opml being the name of the file you want to
convert. The program will print the converted data to
stdout. Use &quot;opml2snow <br>
file.opml &gt;converted&quot; to put the converted data into
the file &quot;converted&quot; or &quot;opml2snow file.opml
&gt;&gt;~/.snownews/urls&quot; to append it to
snownews&rsquo; subscription list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also export
snownews&rsquo; internal format to an OPML file with
&quot;opml2snow --export&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;opml2snow -h&quot; or
its manpage for more usage examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP client features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews&rsquo; HTTP client will
follow HTTP server redirects. If the URL you have entered
points to a permanent redirect it will update the internal
URL to reflect the new location. <br>
Requests will be automatically sent to the new location from
now on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews supports HTTP
authentication and Cookies. To subscribe to a feed that
requires authentication, use an URL
http://username:password@server/feed.rss. You can use
cookies <br>
to supply log in information to a webserver. Put the cookies
you want Snownews to use into the file ~/.snownews/cookies.
The file has to be in standard Netscape cookies.txt file
<br>
format. Mozilla uses this format for example. Snownews will
automatically send the right cookies to the right webserver.
You can also just place a symlink to your browser&rsquo;s
<br>
cookie file, but it is not recommended. If a cookie is
expired, Snownews will print a warning on program start and
not use the cookie. If a cookie is marked as secure (only to
be <br>
used via an SSL secured connection) Snownews will also
discard the cookie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to use a proxy
server to access the internet, set the environment variable
&quot;http_proxy&quot;. Snownews expects this variable to be
in the format <br>
http://your_proxy.org:PORT/
(http://proxy.your_isp.com:8080/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plugins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews has a plugin
architecture that allows to load feeds from external scripts
or pipe downloaded contents through a filter. Such a filter
could be an Atom to RSS converter <br>
for example. The snownews website has a section with
publically available extensions. See
http://snownews.kcore.de/snowscripts/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two types of filters:
execurls and filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execurls are scripts that
produce a valid RSS file by themselves. You can add such
extensions by subscribing to a feed
&quot;exec:/path/to/extension&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filters convert a downloaded
resource on the fly. You usually subscribe to an URL that is
a webpage or a non-RSS feed. If snownews asks you if you
want to use a filter, because <br>
it couldn&rsquo;t parse the resource, enter the location of
your script. You can also add filters to exisiting
subscriptions by highlighting the feed and pressing
&rsquo;e&rsquo; in the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further documentation about
this feature, please visit the website
http://snownews.kcore.de/snowscripts/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snownews is released under the
GNU General Public License version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--charset or -l, Force using this charset. Snownews tries to
guess the correct charset of your terminal, but if fails,
this option can be used to force using a specific one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cursor-on or -c, Always
display the cursor on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update or -u, Automatically
update all subscribed feeds when the application starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help or -h, Show usage summary
and available command line options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version or -V, Print program
version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/bin/snownews</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
http_proxy <br>
Snownews will access the internet through the proxy server
set in this variable. The expected format is
http://your_proxy.org:PORT/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Reporting bugs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you think you found a bug in
Snownews, please report it. Anything that makes the program
crash, regardless what you&rsquo;re doing is a bug and needs
to be fixed. XML parsing <br>
errors are probably not fixable in Snownews since libxml is
responsible for parsing a document&rsquo;s XML. Though you
can report problematic feeds anyway, it may be a bug in
Snownews.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please read
http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/faq#toc4 before you
report a bug.</p>
