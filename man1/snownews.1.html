Snownews is a console RSS/RDF news reader. It supports all versions of RSS
  natively and can be expanded via plugins to support many other other formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main program screen, that is shown right after you start snownews, lets you
  add/remove feeds and update them manually. On the right side of the screen the
  number of new items is shown for every newsfeed. To add a feed press
  <b>'a'</b> and enter the URL. This can be either a http:// or a feed:// URL.
  If you omit the protocol specifier snownews asumes the HTTP protocol. To
  delete a listed feed highlight it with the cursor keys and press <b>'D'.</b> A
  dialog will ask for confirmation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can navigate through the main menu with up and down arrow keys or with
  <b>'n'</b> and <b>'p'.</b> The keys <b>page up/page down, b/space</b> and
  <b>HOME/END, &lt;/&gt;</b> will scroll a page up or down and to the first or
  last entry respectively. Pressing <b>'r'</b> reloads the highlighted feed from
  the server, <b>'R'</b> updates all feeds in your list and <b>'T'</b> refreshes
  the feed ignoring any cache control data. That means, even if the feed has not
  been modified on the server, Snownews will still download the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program will not sort this list alphabetically by default. You can move
  items up and down by pressing <b>'P'</b> and <b>'N'.</b> To sort the feed list
  alphabetically, press <b>'s'.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you highlight a feed and hit Enter the program will display every item for
  this feed. Navigation in all sub menus works as usual. If you press <b>'r'</b>
  the program will reload the current feed. Items may vanish from the list
  completely and new newsitems will appear bold or in colour.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Select an item and hit Enter to read its description. If there is none attached
  to it the text &quot;No description available.&quot; will be displayed
  instead. You can use the arrow keys left and right, repectively <b>'p'</b> and
  <b>'n'</b> to select the previous or next newsitem in the list. Pressing
  <b>'o'</b> will open the link (usually the complete news text) in the browser.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default browser is lynx, but you can change this by pressing <b>'B'</b> in
  the main menu and entering a new default browser. Or you can edit the file
  ~/.snownews/browser. The program replaces %s with the URL when expanding the
  string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can rename a feed by pressing the key <b>'c'</b> and entering its new name.
  To reset its name to the original title enter '-' in this textfield.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A context help window is available everytime by pressing <b>'h'.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Type Ahead Find</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For faster navigation in your feedlist you can use Snownews' Type Ahead Find
  feature. Press the TAB key and the statusline will change into a text entry
  field. While you enter the text you want to search for, highlight will be
  automatically placed on items as they match. If you have selected an item just
  press enter to open the feed. If there are multiple items matching you can
  switch between them by pressing TAB. To quit Type Ahead delete the search text
  or press CTRL+G
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Categories</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snownews uses categories to manage large subscription lists. You can define as
  many categories for a feed as you like. You can then apply a filter in the
  main menu that will only show feeds that have a matching category defined.
  Feeds with a category will have it printed next to their name in the main
  menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To add or remove a feed from a category, press <b>'C'</b> while the feed is
  highlighted in the main menu. If you already have defined categories for other
  feeds you'll get a list of the existing categories. Just press its number to
  add the current feed to this category. To add the feed to a new category,
  press <b>'A'</b> and enter the name of the new category. If you want to remove
  a feed from a category, just press its number in the feed categorization GUI.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can see all defined categories for a feed in the feed info.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Customizing keybindings</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can customize the keybindings by editing the file ~/.snownews/keybindings.
  The format is &quot;function description:key&quot;. Do not change the string
  &quot;function description&quot;. The single character behind the colon
  represents the key the program will associate with the corresponding function.
  If you delete a definition or the program cannot parse the file for some
  reason the default settings will be used instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Colours</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you prefer to see the world in colours you can enable (and configure) colour
  support in Snownews. Edit the file ~/.snownews/colors. To globally enable
  colours in the program, set enabled to &quot;1&quot;. To set a colour, use the
  colour key value that is listed in the comment in that file. You can disable
  usage for single items by using the value &quot;-1&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>HTML conversion</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snownews will try to convert HTML content into plain text before displaying the
  text. Tags will be stripped alltogether and some common HTML entities will be
  translated. By default only the five entities defined in XML (&amp;lt; (&lt;),
  &amp;gt; (&gt;), &amp;amp; (&amp;), &amp;quot; (&quot;) and &amp;apos; ('))
  plus a default setting included will be translated. You can influence this
  behaviour with the definition file at ~/.snownews/html_entities. See the
  comments on top of the file for further details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Importing/exporting subscriptions from other programs:</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snownews can import opml subscription files from other RSS readers into its own
  format with the included program &quot;opml2snow&quot;. To convert an opml
  subscription file type &quot;opml2snow MySubsriptions.opml&quot; with
  MySubscriptions.opml being the name of the file you want to convert. The
  program will print the converted data to stdout. Use &quot;opml2snow file.opml
  &gt;converted&quot; to put the converted data into the file
  &quot;converted&quot; or &quot;opml2snow file.opml
  &gt;&gt;~/.snownews/urls&quot; to append it to snownews' subscription list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also export snownews' internal format to an OPML file with
  &quot;opml2snow --export&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;opml2snow -h&quot; or its manpage for more usage examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>HTTP client features</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snownews' HTTP client will follow HTTP server redirects. If the URL you have
  entered points to a permanent redirect it will update the internal URL to
  reflect the new location. Requests will be automatically sent to the new
  location from now on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snownews supports <b>HTTP authentication</b> and <b>Cookies.</b> To subscribe to
  a feed that requires authentication, use an URL
  <b>http://username:password@server/feed.rss.</b> You can use cookies to supply
  log in information to a webserver. Put the cookies you want Snownews to use
  into the file <b>~/.snownews/cookies.</b> The file has to be in standard
  Netscape cookies.txt file format. Mozilla uses this format for example.
  Snownews will automatically send the right cookies to the right webserver. You
  can also just place a symlink to your browser's cookie file, but it is not
  recommended. If a cookie is expired, Snownews will print a warning on program
  start and not use the cookie. If a cookie is marked as secure (only to be used
  via an SSL secured connection) Snownews will also discard the cookie.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need to use a <b>proxy server</b> to access the internet, set the
  environment variable &quot;http_proxy&quot;. Snownews expects this variable to
  be in the format <i>http://your_proxy.org:PORT/</i>
  (http://proxy.your_isp.com:8080/).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Plugins</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Snownews has a plugin architecture that allows to load feeds from external
  scripts or pipe downloaded contents through a filter. Such a filter could be
  an Atom to RSS converter for example. The snownews website has a section with
  publically available extensions. See
  <b>http://snownews.kcore.de/snowscripts/.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two types of filters: <b>execurls</b> and <b>filters.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Execurls are scripts that produce a valid RSS file by themselves. You can add
  such extensions by subscribing to a feed &quot;exec:/path/to/extension&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Filters convert a downloaded resource on the fly. You usually subscribe to an
  URL that is a webpage or a non-RSS feed. If snownews asks you if you want to
  use a filter, because it couldn't parse the resource, enter the location of
  your script. You can also add filters to exisiting subscriptions by
  highlighting the feed and pressing <b>'e'</b> in the main menu.

<b>Reporting bugs</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you think you found a bug in Snownews, please report it. Anything that makes
  the program crash, regardless what you're doing is a bug and needs to be
  fixed. XML parsing errors are probably not fixable in Snownews since libxml is
  responsible for parsing a document's XML. Though you can report problematic
  feeds anyway, it may be a bug in Snownews.
