lg_intro - introduction to the looking glass
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
The <b>looking glass</b> offers a web based interface to routers to users
  without their needing permission to login to the router. This may be a perfect
  interface for customer support or less savvy folks, and many ISPs have given
  public access to such an interface as a &quot;route server.&quot;
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The looking glass consists of two CGI <b>perl</b>(1) scripts, <i>lg.cgi</i> and
  <i>lgform.cgi</i>, and the <b>lg.conf</b>(5) configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both of these scripts begin with reading the configuration file. If there is an
  error in the file's syntax or if the file can not be found, error messages
  will be displayed on standard-error. The Apache http server redirects
  standard-error to its error log file by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
lgform.cgi displays a html form consisting of a list of possible router commands
  that can be run and a scrolling list of routers that these commands may be run
  on. When the form is submitted, lg.cgi is run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
lg.cgi begins by performing some basic checks on the arguments passed to it. If
  these checks pass, lg.cgi either displays cached data from a previous
  invocation, if that data exists and is within the cache interval, or uses
  <b>clogin</b>(1) to login to the device and execute the command. The results
  of the command are cached if applicable and displayed for the user.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
Besides <b>lg.conf</b>(5), additional instructions for setting up the looking
  glass can be found in the README file under
  <i>/usr/share/rancid/README.lg</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the looking glass scripts require a few perl modules not included with
  rancid. Rancid's configure process does not check for these. See the README
  file.

Rancid's looking glass is based on Ed Kern's (included by permission, thanks
  Ed!), which could once be found on http://nitrous.digex.net/ but has
  apparently been removed. Support for Juniper and Foundry devices, use of
  rancid's device login scripts, and additional commands and checks have been
  added to the original.</div>
