<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lg_intro - introduction to the looking glass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
The looking glass offers a web based interface to routers to
users without their needing permission to login to the
router. This may be a perfect interface for customer support
<br>
or less savvy folks, and many ISPs have given public access
to such an interface as a &quot;route server.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The looking glass consists of two CGI perl(1) scripts,
lg.cgi and lgform.cgi, and the lg.conf(5) configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of these scripts begin with
reading the configuration file. If there is an error in the
file&rsquo;s syntax or if the file can not be found, error
messages will be displayed on <br>
standard-error. The Apache http server redirects
standard-error to its error log file by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgform.cgi displays a html form
consisting of a list of possible router commands that can be
run and a scrolling list of routers that these commands may
be run on. When the form <br>
is submitted, lg.cgi is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lg.cgi begins by performing some
basic checks on the arguments passed to it. If these checks
pass, lg.cgi either displays cached data from a previous
invocation, if that data <br>
exists and is within the cache interval, or uses clogin(1)
to login to the device and execute the command. The results
of the command are cached if applicable and displayed for
<br>
the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Besides lg.conf(5), additional instructions for setting up
the looking glass can be found in the README file under
/usr/share/rancid/README.lg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the looking glass
scripts require a few perl modules not included with rancid.
Rancid&rsquo;s configure process does not check for these.
See the README file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cloginrc(5), clogin(1), lg.conf(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Rancid&rsquo;s looking glass is based on Ed Kern&rsquo;s
(included by permission, thanks Ed!), which could once be
found on http://nitrous.digex.net/ but has apparently been
removed. <br>
Support for Juniper and Foundry devices, use of
rancid&rsquo;s device login scripts, and additional commands
and checks have been added to the original.</p>
