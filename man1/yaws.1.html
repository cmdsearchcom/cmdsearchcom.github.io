<p>YAWS(1) User Commands YAWS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
yaws - yet another webserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
yaws [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Yaws is fast lightweight webserver. It can run as daemon or
in interactive mode where it is possible to directly
interact with the webserver. Yaws is particularly good at
gener&acirc; <br>
ating dynamic content. See the user docs for more
information on that topic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAEMON/SERVER options <br>
-i | --interactive <br>
Interactive mode. This will start yaws in interactive mode
with an erlang prompt. All error_logger messages will be
written to the tty as well in this mode. Use this when <br>
developing yaws code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w | --winteractive <br>
Cygwin inteactive mode (werl)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D | --daemon <br>
Daemon mode. This will start yaws as a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--heart <br>
This will cause the yaws system to be automatically
restarted in case it should crash. This switch also requires
the --daemon switch to be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--heart-restart=C,T <br>
This controls the number of restarts in a given time period
that heart tolerates before refusing to restart Yaws. By
default, heart allows up to 5 restarts within a 60 <br>
second period before refusing to restart Yaws again. This
option allows up to C restarts in T seconds instead. To
allow infinite restarts, set both C and T to 0. This <br>
switch automatically enables the --heart switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Debug mode. This will produce some auxiliary error output
for some error conditions. It will also start the otp sasl
lib for additional error printouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodebug <br>
Non-debug mode. This is useful for running interactively via
the -i option but without incurring the performance
penalties of debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--conf file <br>
Use a different configuration file than the default. If the
configuration parameter config is set, yaws use it as
default configuration file. Else, The default
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file when running as root is /etc/yaws/yaws.conf. When
running as a non priviliged user, yaws will search for its
configuration file in the following order. First in <br>
$HOME/yaws.conf, then in ./yaws.conf and finally in
/etc/yaws/yaws.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--runmod module <br>
Tells yaws to call module:start/0 at startup. This makes it
possible to startup user specific applications together with
yaws.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pa path <br>
Add path to the yaws system search path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tracetraf <br>
Traffic trace mode. All traffic will be written to a trace
file called trace.traffic in the log directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tracehttp <br>
HTTP trace mode. All HTTP messages will be written to a
trace file called trace.http in the log directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--traceout <br>
When yaws is put into trace mode using either --tracetraf or
--tracehttp, traces are written to files. If we provide the
--traceout flag, the trace will also be written to <br>
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace <br>
Sames as --tracetraf --traceout. I.e. trace everything and
write to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mnesiadir dir <br>
Start Mnesia in directory &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sname xxx <br>
Start yaws as a distributed erlang node with name
&lt;xxx&gt; using the unqualified hostname as nodename
postfix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-kpoll <br>
By default, yaws starts erlang with +K true. This flag
reverses that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name xxx <br>
Start yaws as a distributed erlang node with name
&lt;xxx&gt; using the fully qualified hostname as nodename
postfix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proto_dist Mod <br>
Use module Mod for erlang distribution. This is typically
only used when we want to run erlang distribution over
SSL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--erlarg STRING <br>
Pass STRING as an additional argument to the &quot;erl&quot;
program. If STRING comprises multiple words, you must quote
it so that your shell passes it to yaws as a single
argu&acirc; <br>
ment. If STRING contains any single quote characters, you
must quote each of them as well. For example, to pass the
option -env NAME O&rsquo;Keeffe to &quot;erl&quot; from a
Bourne-com&acirc; <br>
patible shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--erlarg &quot;-env NAME
O&acute;Keeffe&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--id ID <br>
This flag sets the id. If we&rsquo;re starting a daemon (or
an interactive system) it gives the Yaws server the identity
ID. This means that the server will write all internal <br>
files into the directory $HOME/.yaws/yaws/ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yaws also creates a file called
$HOME/.yaws/yaws/ID/CTL which contains the portnumber the
daemon is listening on for control request by the control
command such as &quot;yaws <br>
--hup&quot; etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we&rsquo;re invoking a
control command which should perform some control function
on the daemon, we may have to give the --id flag also to the
control command. If we don&rsquo;t do <br>
this the control command may interact with the wrong daemon
due to finding the wrong &quot;ctl&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon may also optionally
specify the &quot;id&quot; in the yaws.conf configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--umask MASK <br>
Set the umask for the daemon to MASK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROL OPTIONS <br>
The following list of options are are used to control the
daemon from the &quot;outside&quot; while it is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hup [--id ID] <br>
HUP the daemon. This forces the daemon to reread the
configuration file. It also makes the daemon empty all its
internal content caches. Hence when updating the doc <br>
root, HUPing the daemon is the fastest way to see the
content updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stop [--id id] <br>
Stop the daemon (called id)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ls Lists current ids and
status of all yaws servers on localhost. In practice this
amounts to a listdir in $HOME/.yaws/yaws - and check whether
the different systems who has <br>
created files there are alive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status [--id id] <br>
Query a running yaws daemon for its status, and print
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stats [--id id] <br>
Query a running yaws daemon for its statistics, and print
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--running-config [--id id] <br>
Query a running yaws daemon for its current configuration,
and print it. This can be useful when attempting to figure
out how to set config in embedded mode. Configure <br>
yaws to you liking in non-embedded mode, run this command
and use the output to populate the embedded mode
records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--load Modules [--id id] <br>
Try to (re)load erlang modules into a running daemon. This
is useful after modifying appmods or modules used by
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-dump [--id id] <br>
Produce a debug dump on stdout. In particular this code
lists what we refer to as suspicious processes. I.e.
processes that might be hanging or processes that are
&quot;large&quot; <br>
- hardcoded to 40k words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ctltrace [--id ID] http |
traffic | off <br>
Control the trace capabilities of a running yaws daemon. If
the http or traffic option is given, the daemon will write a
log for debug purposes into the logdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wait-started[=T] [--id ID]
<br>
Waits at most 30 seconds for the server to start. Exits with
0 if server is running, 1 otherwise. Typically useful in
test scripts. The default 30 seconds can be modified <br>
by appending =T to the option, where T is the desired number
of seconds to wait for the server to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISC OPTIONS <br>
--check YawsFile [IncDirs ....] <br>
Test compile a &lsquo;.yaws&rsquo; file. Useful in Makefiles
when we want to ensure that all .yaws files are
syntactically correct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
output version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
HOME Is used to determine where we write the temporary
files. By default all tmp files end up in $HOME/.yaws. This
includes the JIT files that are the result of processed
.yaws <br>
files and also the so called control file that is used by
the daemon to write the port number to which it is listening
for control commands such as &quot;yaws --status&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus HOME is the handle we use
in the control commands to find the control file so that we
know where to connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YAWSHOME <br>
Can be used to override the HOME variable. This is useful
when we for example are running yaws under port binding
programs such as authpriv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s useful by distros
that don&rsquo;t want Yaws to write any files ever in the
HOME directory of root.</p>
