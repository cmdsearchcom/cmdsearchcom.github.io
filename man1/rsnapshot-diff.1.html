rsnapshot-diff is a companion utility for rsnapshot, which traverses two
  parallel directory structures and calculates the difference between them. By
  default it is silent apart from displaying summary information at the end, but
  it can be made more verbose.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the summary, &quot;added&quot; files may very well include files which at
  first glance also appear at the same place in the older directory structure.
  However, because the files differ in some respect, they are different files.
  They have a different inode number. Consequently if you use -v most of its
  output may appear to be pairs of files with the same name being removed and
  added.

  <dd class="It-tag">These are the only compulsory parameters, and should be the
      names of two directories to compare. Their order doesn't matter,
      rsnapshot-diff will always compare the younger to the older, so files that
      appear only in the older will be reported as having been removed, and
      files that appear only in the younger will be reported as having been
      added.</dd>
