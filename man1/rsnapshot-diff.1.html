<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rsnapshot-diff - a utility for comparing the disk usage of
two snapshots taken by rsnapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rsnapshot-diff [-h|vVi] dir1 dir2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rsnapshot-diff is a companion utility for rsnapshot, which
traverses two parallel directory structures and calculates
the difference between them. By default it is silent apart
<br>
from displaying summary information at the end, but it can
be made more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the summary,
&quot;added&quot; files may very well include files which at
first glance also appear at the same place in the older
directory structure. However, because the files differ <br>
in some respect, they are different files. They have a
different inode number. Consequently if you use -v most of
its output may appear to be pairs of files with the same
name <br>
being removed and added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h (help) <br>
Displays help information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H (human) <br>
Display more human-friendly numbers - as well as showing the
number of bytes changed, also show MB and GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i (ignore) <br>
If verbosity is turned on, -i suppresses information about
symlinks, directories, and special files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s (show size) <br>
Show the size of each changed file after the + or - sign. To
sort the files by decreasing size, use this option and run
the output through &quot;sort -k 2 -rn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v (verbose) <br>
Be verbose. This will spit out a list of all changes as they
are encountered, apart from symlink, as well as the summary
at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V (more verbose) <br>
Be more verbose - as well as listing changed files,
unchanged files and symlinks will be listed too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir1 and dir2 <br>
These are the only compulsory parameters, and should be the
names of two directories to compare. Their order
doesn&rsquo;t matter, rsnapshot-diff will always compare the
younger <br>
to the older, so files that appear only in the older will be
reported as having been removed, and files that appear only
in the younger will be reported as having been added.</p>
