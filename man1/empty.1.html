<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
empty is an utility that provides a simple interface to
execute and/or interact with processes under pseudo-terminal
sessions. This tool is definitely useful in programming of
<br>
shell scripts which are used to communicate with interactive
programs like telnet or ftp. In some cases empty can be a
substitution for TCL/expect or other similar programming
<br>
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several common forms
of command lines for empty. But the first execution of empty
is usually a start in the daemon mode to fork a new command
(process) under PTY-ses&acirc; <br>
sion. This can be done with -f key. An interface for the
input and output data channels of the forked process is
performed by two fifo files which names may be specified
with -i <br>
and -o keys. These files are automatically created/deleted
any time you start/exit empty daemon, so you must not create
them manually. If you did not specify these fifo files in
<br>
the command line, empty names them by itself basing on its
PID and PID of forked PTY process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point any application
can easily communicate with forked process by writing data
to the input fifo and reading answers from the output fifo,
see EXAMPLES section for the <br>
details. To simplify this operations, empty offers an
interface to just send any data (use -s key), or even to
watch the output fifo for multiple keyphrases and reply to
the <br>
input fifo with one of the responses (see -w key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note! Input fifo for empty -f
... is usually an output fifo for empty -w and empty -s
forms. And output fifo of empty -f ... is an input fifo for
empty -w ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If something goes wrong the
forked process may be killed by the standard kill command,
or using -k key of empty. See -p option to save PID of empty
daemon process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fork, spawn, start or execute
a new process specified by the command and its arguments. If
you omit fifo files, empty with its job control algorithm
will create them <br>
under /tmp directory using this templates: empty.PPID.PID.in
and empty.PPID.PID.out, here PPID is usually your shell
system process ID and PID is system process ID of <br>
empty-daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s send data (request) to the
forked process. If fifo file was not specified with -o key,
empty will try to find an automatically created fifo file it
in /tmp directory. <br>
Instead of command line you can send your request or data
directly to standard input (stdin) of empty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w watch for one or more
keyphrases and if specified send the appropriated response
to the input fifo. If response is not set, empty waits for
the proper keyphrase then <br>
exits. With -w key empty returns the number of matched
keyphrase-response pair, or 255 if fails to find this match
(see -t key for details of possible exit on time&acirc; <br>
out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r read from output FIFO one
line (default) or one block of data (if -b size was
specified). If -t n key was placed, exit on timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l list automatically created
jobs by your shell. NB! Your custom jobs, which fifo files
you specified with -i and -o keys, are not displayed. So if
you did not spec&acirc; <br>
ify fifo files with -i and -o keys all operations are done
under the job marked current</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k send signal to the process
with pid. If you did not specify pid, empty tries to find it
within the list of automatically created jobs. If signal is
omitted the <br>
default SIGTERM is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h print short help message and
exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i fifo1 a fifo file, which is
used as input for a forked process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o fifo2 a fifo file, which is
used as output for a forked process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L file.log This option allows
to log the whole empty session to a file. Marks &gt;&gt;&gt;
and &lt;&lt;&lt; show the directions of data flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logfile-mode=mode <br>
This option allows to choose the mode of the log file
created with the -L option. The default mode is 0600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file.pid Save PID of empty
daemon process to a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t n If input FIFO is empty,
wait for n seconds (default is 10) to receive the keyphrase
then exit on timeout with 255 code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c force empty to use stdin for
data or requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Strip the last character from
the input. Works with -s and -w keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v kvazi verbose mode. Show all
contents of received buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Start a new PTY-session with telnet to localhost: <br>
empty -f -i in.fifo -o out.fifo -p empty.pid -L empty.log
telnet localhost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interact with telnet: <br>
empty -w -i out.fifo -o in.fifo ogin &rsquo;my_user0 <br>
empty -w -i out.fifo -o in.fifo assword
&rsquo;my_password0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send commands to telnet with
empty: <br>
empty -s -o in.fifo who <br>
empty -s -o in.fifo &quot;ls -la /0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same using STDIN: <br>
echo who | empty -s -o in.fifo <br>
echo &quot;ls -la /&quot; | empty -s -o in.fifo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just cat output from telnet:
<br>
cat out.fifo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read one line from out.fifo:
<br>
empty -r -i out.fifo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send commands to telnet with
ordinary echo: <br>
echo &quot;who am i&quot; &gt; in.fifo <br>
echo &quot;uname -a&quot; &gt; in.fifo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill a process with PID 1234:
<br>
empty -k 1234 <br>
or <br>
kill 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Telnet session with
automatically created jobs: <br>
empty -f telnet localhost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interact with telnet using job
control: <br>
empty -w ogin &rsquo;my_user0 <br>
empty -w assword &rsquo;my_password0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List automatically created jobs:
<br>
empty -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PPID PID TYPE FILENAME <br>
479 706 in /tmp/empty.479.706.in <br>
479 706 out /tmp/empty.479.706.out <br>
479 711 in /tmp/empty.479.711.in <br>
479 711 out /tmp/empty.479.711.out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">479 711 current</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
It is considered insecure to send a password in the command
line like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty -w assword
&rsquo;my_password0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty -s &rsquo;my_password0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason is that the command
line arguments are visible to the system while empty is
running. Any local user can see them with ps(1), sometimes
they are visible even remotely <br>
with finger(1). Also your server may have some monitoring
tools which may store the output from ps(1) in their logs.
There are also other, more complicated ways to compromise
<br>
this information. Generally, you should take command line
arguments as (possibly) visible to every one unless you
really know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty with &rsquo;-s&rsquo; flag
runs quickly in most cases, but still it can hang for a
number of reasons (like fifo overloading), and even if it
runs quick you still cannot be sure that no <br>
one will see its command line arguments even in this short
time. empty with &rsquo;-w&rsquo; flag is even worse because
it must wait for the keyphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A better way to send the
password to the supervised program is to read it from
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty -s [common options]
&lt;./password-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or from a pipe:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get-password-of-user
&quot;$user&quot; |empty -s [common options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should still make sure that
you do not send any password via command line while creating
this file, and certainly you should set some safe
permissions to this file AND its <br>
directory (with the parent directories) before reading the
password from the file OR writing the password to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another possible way is to use
your shell&rsquo;s builtin (but see below):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;$password&quot;
|empty -s [common options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many shells like bash(1), csh(1)
and FreeBSD&rsquo;s sh(1) do not call external echo(1)
command but use their own builtin echo command. Since no
external command is started (the shell <br>
itself does all that echo(1) must do), nothing is shown in
the process list. It is beyond this manual page to discuss
the way to make sure that your shell uses the builtin
com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
If any error occurs empty usually exits with code 255.
Otherwise zero or some positive value (see -w key) is
returned.</p>
