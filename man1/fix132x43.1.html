<p>fix132x43(1) Svgalib User Manual fix132x43(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fix132x43 - fix problems with certain (132 column) graphics
modes dump the state of the card as the svgalib chipset
driver sees it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fix132x43 options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program tries to fix problems with extended textmodes
on some cards. The problem is that for 132x43 textmode, some
BIOS&rsquo;s set the vertical display end register to 349
(350), <br>
instead of 343 (344 = 3 * 8 scanlines). Because in Linux
textmode video memory is usually filled with old text that
has already scrolled away (this includes the area below the
<br>
43rd textmode line, which changes when the console scrolls),
the top half of a constantly changing irrelevant text line
is visible at the bottom of the screen, which is very <br>
annoying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program sets the VGA
Vertical Display End register to the proper value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem is at least present
in the BIOS of most Cirrus Logic 542x based cards, and some
WD90C03x based cards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LINES environment variable
is used to detect 43 or 44 line consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
You have to specify exactly one of the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fix problem of annoying
changing line of text at bottom of screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Switch to 9 line characters
(400 line frame, 70 Hz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Switch to 11 line characters
(480 line frame, 60 Hz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fix132x43 does not usually
provide this option but it can be enabled in the source of
fix132x43.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Switch to 8 line characters
again (350 line frame, 70 Hz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility is part of svgalib
and can be found in the utils/ subdirectory of the original
svgalib distribution. However, it is not installed by
default, s.t. it is unclear <br>
where you can find it if your svgalib was install linux
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of any such problem,
simply get an svgalib distribution from the net. You
don&rsquo;t need to install it. Just make in the utils/
subdirecty. As of this writing, <br>
svgalib-1.2.12.tar.gz is the latest version and can be
retrieved by ftp from sunsite.unc.edu at
/pub/Linux/libs/graphics and tsx-11.mit.edu at
/pub/linux/sources/libs which will <br>
most probably be mirrored by a site close to you.</p>
