<p>SHOWKEY(1) General Commands Manual SHOWKEY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
showkey - examine the codes sent by the keyboard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
showkey [-h|--help] [-a|--ascii] [-s|--scancodes]
[-k|--keycodes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
showkey prints to standard output either the scan codes or
the keycode or the &lsquo;ascii&rsquo; code of each key
pressed. In the first two modes the program runs until 10
seconds have <br>
elapsed since the last key press or release event, or until
it receives a suitable signal, like SIGTERM, from another
process. In &lsquo;ascii&rsquo; mode the program terminates
when the <br>
user types ^D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in scancode dump mode,
showkey prints in hexadecimal format each byte received from
the keyboard to the standard output. A new line is printed
when an interval of about 0.1 <br>
seconds occurs between the bytes received, or when the
internal receive buffer fills up. This can be used to
determine roughly, what byte sequences the keyboard sends at
once on <br>
a given key press. The scan code dumping mode is primarily
intended for debugging the keyboard driver or other low
level interfaces. As such it shouldn&rsquo;t be of much
interest to <br>
the regular end-user. However, some modern keyboards have
keys or buttons that produce scancodes to which the kernel
does not associate a keycode, and, after finding out what
<br>
these are, the user can assign keycodes with
setkeycodes(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in the default keycode dump
mode, showkey prints to the standard output the keycode
number or each key pressed or released. The kind of the
event, press or release, is also <br>
reported. Keycodes are numbers assigned by the kernel to
each individual physical key. Every key has always only one
associated keycode number, whether the keyboard sends single
<br>
or multiple scan codes when pressing it. Using showkey in
this mode, you can find out what numbers to use in your
personalized keymap files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in &lsquo;ascii&rsquo; dump
mode, showkey prints to the standard output the decimal,
octal, and hexadecimal value(s) of the key pressed,
according to he present keymap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h --help <br>
showkey prints to the standard error output its version
number, a compile option and a short usage message, then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s --scancodes <br>
Starts showkey in scan code dump mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --keycodes <br>
Starts showkey in keycode dump mode. This is the default,
when no command line options are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a --ascii <br>
Starts showkey in &lsquo;ascii&rsquo; dump mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.6 KERNELS <br>
In 2.6 kernels key codes lie in the range 1-255, instead of
1-127. Key codes larger than 127 are returned as three bytes
of which the low order 7 bits are: zero, bits 13-7, and <br>
bits 6-0 of the key code. The high order bits are: 0/1 for
make/break, 1, 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In 2.6 kernels raw mode, or
scancode mode, is not very raw at all. Scan codes are first
translated to key codes, and when scancodes are desired, the
key codes are translated <br>
back. Various transformations are involved, and there is no
guarantee at all that the final result corresponds to what
the keyboard hardware did send. So, if you want to know the
<br>
scan codes sent by various keys it is better to boot a 2.4
kernel. Since 2.6.9 there also is the boot option
atkbd.softraw=0 that tells the 2.6 kernel to return the
actual scan <br>
codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The raw scan codes are available only on AT and PS/2
keyboards, and even then they are disabled unless the
atkbd.softraw=0 kernel parameter is used. When the raw scan
codes are <br>
not available, the kernel uses a fixed built-in table to
produce scan codes from keycodes. Thus, setkeycodes(8) can
affect the output of showkey in scan code dump mode.</p>
