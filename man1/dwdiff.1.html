<p>DWDIFF(1) Delimited word diff program DWDIFF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dwdiff - a delimited word diff program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dwdiff [OPTIONS] OLD FILE NEW FILE <br>
dwdiff [OPTIONS] --diff-input [DIFF FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level
instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in
that it allows the user to specify what should be considered
<br>
whitespace, and in that it takes an optional list of
characters that should be considered delimiters. Delimiters
are single characters that are treated as if they are words,
even <br>
when there is no whitespace separating them from preceding
words or delimiters. dwdiff is mostly command-line
compatible with wdiff. Only the --autopager, --terminal and
<br>
--avoid-wraps options are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default output from dwdiff
is the new text, with the deleted and inserted parts
annotated with markers. Command line options are available
to change both what is printed, and <br>
the markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dwdiff accepts the following options (Note that all strings
will first be escape expanded. All standard &minus;escapes
are supported, as well as and U Unicode escapes):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print version and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d delimiters,
--delimiters=delimiters <br>
Specify a list of characters to be used as delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --punctuation <br>
Use punctuation characters as delimiters. The exact set of
punctuation characters depends on the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W whitespace,
--white-space=whitespace <br>
Specify a list of characters to be used as whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-input <br>
Interpret the input as the output from diff in the Unified
Diff format (usually produced by diff -u). In this case only
one input file is allowed. This option allows <br>
reformating diff output with dwdiff, and is useful for
example to post-process the output of svn diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1, --no-deleted <br>
Suppress printing of words deleted from the first file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --no-inserted <br>
Suppress printing of words inserted in the second file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3, --no-common <br>
Suppress printing of words common to both files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L[width],
--line-numbers[=width] <br>
Show line numbers at the start of each line. The line
numbers displayed are the line number in the old file and
the line number in the new file respectively. The optional
<br>
width argument is the minimum number of positions per line
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cnum, --context=num <br>
Show num lines of context before and after each changes. A
line with only -- is printed between blocks of changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --statistics <br>
Print statistics when done. The numbers printed include the
number of words from in both files, the number of deleted
words, the number of inserted words, and the number <br>
of changed words. The number of changed words is counted as
the number of words that are removed from the first file,
and the number of words that replace them from the <br>
second file. All of these numbers are also expressed as a
percentage of the total number of words in the file the
words came from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore differences in case when comparing words. This option
is only available if the diff program that is called
provides it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --ignore-formatting <br>
Ignore differences in formatting of characters. This option
switches to using the Unicode compatibility decomposition
instead of the canonical decomposition. The compati&acirc;
<br>
bility decomposition discards formatting information. For
example, the ligature fi will be decomposed into two
separate characters for the purposes of comparison. However,
<br>
also super- and subscript will be regarded equal as well as
different rotations of the same character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[spec], --color[=spec] <br>
Color mode. The optional spec can be used to customize the
colors. spec consists of [delete],[insert]. If either is
omited it will be set to its default color (bright red <br>
or bright green respectively). Both parts of the spec
consist of [foreground][:background]. To obtain a list of
permissible color names, use the word
&lsquo;&lsquo;list&rsquo;&rsquo; as spec. <br>
Alternatively, you can specify any escape sequence to set
attributes as a color by prepending e:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard markers for the
begin and end of deleted and inserted text are suppressed,
but any markers specified on the command line will still be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --less-mode <br>
As -p but also overstrike deleted whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --printer <br>
Use overstriking with an underscore and bold text to
emphasize changes. This is implemented by first printing the
underscore or a duplicate of the character to be printed,
<br>
followed by a backspace, followed by the character. On
regular terminals you won&rsquo;t see any effect. The
less(1) command will however show underlined and bold
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard markers for the
begin and end of deleted and inserted text are suppressed,
but any markers specified on the command line will still be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnum, --match-context=num <br>
Use num words of context before and after words for
matching. Words in the old text will then only match words
in the new text if words surrounding them are also equal.
<br>
This improves the output for dwdiff for large changes with
frequently occuring words. However, using context requires
more disk space and more processing time. The default <br>
value is 1. Set this option to 0 to revert to the pre 1.5
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--aggregate-changes <br>
Allow multiple close changes to be treated as one change, if
context words are used (see --match-context). This option
reduces the processing time as the changes reported <br>
by the diff program are not post-processed to give more
precise results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A algorithm,
--algorithm=algorithm <br>
Select the algorithm to be used for determining differences.
There are three possible values for algorithm: best, which
tries to find the minimal set of changes, normal, <br>
which trades some optimality for speed, and fast, which
assumes that the input is large and contains few changes. By
default the normal algorithm is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S[marker],
--paragraph-separator[=marker] <br>
Show insertion or deletion of blocks of lines with only
whitespace characters. A special marker is inserted into the
output to indicate these blocks. The default marker <br>
is --.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wdiff-output <br>
Create wdiff compatible output. The dwdiff program uses a
different output algorithm, which provides a more intuitive
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w string, --start-delete=string
<br>
Specify a string to mark begin of deleted text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x string, --stop-delete=string
<br>
Specify a string to mark end of deleted text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y string, --start-insert=string
<br>
Specify a string to mark begin of inserted text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z string, --stop-insert=string
<br>
Specify a string to mark end of inserted text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --repeat-markers <br>
Repeat the begin and end markers at the start and end of
line if a change crosses a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--profile=name <br>
Load the profile with name name from the .dwdiffrc file in
the user&rsquo;s home directory. Only the last profile named
is actually read, unless it is followed by a --no-profile
<br>
option. By default the profile named default is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-profile <br>
Disable reading of profiles, unless followed by another
--profile option. This also disables reading the default
profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single dash (-) as a file can
be used to denote standard input. Only one file can be read
from standard input. To stop dwdiff from interpreting file
names that start with a <br>
dash as options, one can specify a double dash (--) after
which dwdiff will interpret any following arguments as files
to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILES <br>
Since version 2.1.0, dwdiff allows users to create profiles.
A profile is a set of options that can be loaded using the
--profile option. Profiles are specified in the .dwdiffrc
<br>
in the user&rsquo;s home directory. The format of the
.dwdiffrc file is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line contains either a profile
header (a text enclosed in []) or a long option name without
leading dashes, optionally followed by it&rsquo;s argument.
Arguments are stripped of <br>
whitespace surrounding it. If an argument starts and ends
with matching double or single quotes, these are removed as
well. Comments can be included by starting a line with a
<br>
hash mark (#).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no profile is specified, the
profile named default will be loaded, unless the
--no-profile option is specified. Here is an example
.dwdiffrc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[default] <br>
color red,blue <br>
punctuation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[html] <br>
start-delete &lt;span style=&quot;color=red&quot;&gt; <br>
stop-delete &lt;/span&gt; <br>
start-insert &lt;span style=&quot;color=green&quot;&gt; <br>
stop-insert &lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[space-only] <br>
# Use only a space as whitespace. <br>
white-space &quot; &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are
using the latest version of dwdiff
&lt;http://os.ghalkes.nl/dwdiff.html&gt;. When reporting
bugs, please include a minimal <br>
example that demonstrates the problem.</p>
