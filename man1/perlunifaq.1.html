<p>PERLUNIFAQ(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLUNIFAQ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlunifaq - Perl Unicode FAQ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q and A <br>
This is a list of questions and answers about Unicode in
Perl, intended to be read after perlunitut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlunitut isn&rsquo;t really a
Unicode tutorial, is it? <br>
No, and this isn&rsquo;t really a Unicode FAQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl has an abstracted interface
for all supported character encodings, so this is actually a
generic &quot;Encode&quot; tutorial and &quot;Encode&quot;
FAQ. But many people think that Unicode is <br>
special and magical, and I didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint
them, so I decided to call the document a Unicode
tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What character encodings does
Perl support? <br>
To find out which character encodings your Perl supports,
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MEncode -le &quot;print
for Encode-&gt;encodings(&rsquo;:all&rsquo;)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which version of perl should I
use? <br>
Well, if you can, upgrade to the most recent, but certainly
5.8.1 or newer. The tutorial and FAQ assume the latest
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should also check your
modules, and upgrade them if necessary. For example,
HTML::Entities requires version &gt;= 1.32 to function
correctly, even though the changelog is silent <br>
about this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What about binary data, like
images? <br>
Well, apart from a bare &quot;binmode $fh&quot;, you
shouldn&rsquo;t treat them specially. (The binmode is needed
because otherwise Perl may convert line endings on Win32
systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful, though, to never
combine text strings with binary strings. If you need text
in a binary stream, encode your text strings first using the
appropriate encoding, then <br>
join them with binary strings. See also: &quot;What if I
don&rsquo;t encode?&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When should I decode or encode?
<br>
Whenever you&rsquo;re communicating text with anything that
is external to your perl process, like a database, a text
file, a socket, or another program. Even if the thing
you&rsquo;re <br>
communicating with is also written in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What if I don&rsquo;t decode?
<br>
Whenever your encoded, binary string is used together with a
text string, Perl will assume that your binary string was
encoded with ISO-8859-1, also known as latin-1. If it <br>
wasn&rsquo;t latin-1, then your data is unpleasantly
converted. For example, if it was UTF-8, the individual
bytes of multibyte characters are seen as separate
characters, and then <br>
again converted to UTF-8. Such double encoding can be
compared to double HTML encoding (&quot;&amp;amp;gt;&quot;),
or double URI encoding (%253E).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This silent implicit decoding is
known as &quot;upgrading&quot;. That may sound positive, but
it&rsquo;s best to avoid it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What if I don&rsquo;t encode?
<br>
Your text string will be sent using the bytes in
Perl&rsquo;s internal format. In some cases, Perl will warn
you that you&rsquo;re doing something wrong, with a friendly
warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wide character in print at
example.pl line 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the internal format is
often UTF-8, these bugs are hard to spot, because UTF-8 is
usually the encoding you wanted! But don&rsquo;t be lazy,
and don&rsquo;t use the fact that Perl&rsquo;s <br>
internal format is UTF-8 to your advantage. Encode
explicitly to avoid weird bugs, and to show to maintenance
programmers that you thought this through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is there a way to automatically
decode or encode? <br>
If all data that comes from a certain handle is encoded in
exactly the same way, you can tell the PerlIO system to
automatically decode everything, with the
&quot;encoding&quot; layer. If <br>
you do this, you can&rsquo;t accidentally forget to decode
or encode anymore, on things that use the layered
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can provide this layer when
&quot;open&quot;ing the file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open my $fh,
&rsquo;&gt;:encoding(UTF-8)&rsquo;, $filename; # auto
encoding on write <br>
open my $fh, &rsquo;&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)&rsquo;, $filename;
# auto decoding on read</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if you already have an open
filehandle:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binmode $fh,
&rsquo;:encoding(UTF-8)&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some database drivers for DBI
can also automatically encode and decode, but that is
sometimes limited to the UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What if I don&rsquo;t know which
encoding was used? <br>
Do whatever you can to find out, and if you have to: guess.
(Don&rsquo;t forget to document your guess with a
comment.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could open the document in a
web browser, and change the character set or character
encoding until you can visually confirm that all characters
look the way they should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to reliably
detect the encoding automatically, so if people keep sending
you data without charset indication, you may have to educate
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I use Unicode in my Perl
sources? <br>
Yes, you can! If your sources are UTF-8 encoded, you can
indicate that with the &quot;use utf8&quot; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use utf8;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This doesn&rsquo;t do anything
to your input, or to your output. It only influences the way
your sources are read. You can use Unicode in string
literals, in identifiers (but they <br>
still have to be &quot;word characters&quot; according to
&quot;792</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data::Dumper doesn&rsquo;t
restore the UTF8 flag; is it broken? <br>
No, Data::Dumper&rsquo;s Unicode abilities are as they
should be. There have been some complaints that it should
restore the UTF8 flag when the data is read again with
&quot;eval&quot;. However, <br>
you should really not look at the flag, and nothing
indicates that Data::Dumper should break this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s what happens: when
Perl reads in a string literal, it sticks to 8 bit encoding
as long as it can. (But perhaps originally it was internally
encoded as UTF-8, when you <br>
dumped it.) When it has to give that up because other
characters are added to the text string, it silently
upgrades the string to UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you properly encode your
strings for output, none of this is of your concern, and you
can just &quot;eval&quot; dumped data as always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why do regex character classes
sometimes match only in the ASCII range? <br>
Why do some characters not uppercase or lowercase correctly?
<br>
Starting in Perl 5.14 (and partially in Perl 5.12), just put
a &quot;use feature &rsquo;unicode_strings&rsquo;&quot; near
the beginning of your program. Within its lexical scope you
shouldn&rsquo;t have <br>
this problem. It also is automatically enabled under
&quot;use feature &rsquo;:5.12&rsquo;&quot; or using
&quot;-E&quot; on the command line for Perl 5.12 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rationale for requiring this
is to not break older programs that rely on the way things
worked before Unicode came along. Those older programs knew
only about the ASCII <br>
character set, and so may not work properly for additional
characters. When a string is encoded in UTF-8, Perl assumes
that the program is prepared to deal with Unicode, but <br>
when the string isn&rsquo;t, Perl assumes that only ASCII
(unless it is an EBCDIC platform) is wanted, and so those
characters that are not ASCII characters aren&rsquo;t
recognized as to <br>
what they would be in Unicode. &quot;use feature
&rsquo;unicode_strings&rsquo;&quot; tells Perl to treat all
characters as Unicode, whether the string is encoded in
UTF-8 or not, thus avoiding the <br>
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, on earlier Perls, or if
you pass strings to subroutines outside the feature&rsquo;s
scope, you can force Unicode semantics by changing the
encoding to UTF-8 by doing <br>
&quot;utf8::upgrade($string)&quot;. This can be used safely
on any string, as it checks and does not change strings that
have already been upgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more detailed discussion,
see Unicode::Semantics on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I determine if a string
is a text string or a binary string? <br>
You can&rsquo;t. Some use the UTF8 flag for this, but
that&rsquo;s misuse, and makes well behaved modules like
Data::Dumper look bad. The flag is useless for this purpose,
because it&rsquo;s off <br>
when an 8 bit encoding (by default ISO-8859-1) is used to
store the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is something you, the
programmer, has to keep track of; sorry. You could consider
adopting a kind of &quot;Hungarian notation&quot; to help
with this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I convert from encoding
FOO to encoding BAR? <br>
By first converting the FOO-encoded byte string to a text
string, and then the text string to a BAR-encoded byte
string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $text_string =
decode(&rsquo;FOO&rsquo;, $foo_string); <br>
my $bar_string = encode(&rsquo;BAR&rsquo;,
$text_string);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by skipping the text string
part, and going directly from one binary encoding to the
other:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Encode qw(from_to); <br>
from_to($string, &rsquo;FOO&rsquo;, &rsquo;BAR&rsquo;); #
changes contents of $string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by letting automatic decoding
and encoding do all the work:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open my $foofh,
&rsquo;&lt;:encoding(FOO)&rsquo;,
&rsquo;example.foo.txt&rsquo;; <br>
open my $barfh, &rsquo;&gt;:encoding(BAR)&rsquo;,
&rsquo;example.bar.txt&rsquo;; <br>
print { $barfh } $_ while &lt;$foofh&gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What are &quot;decode_utf8&quot;
and &quot;encode_utf8&quot;? <br>
These are alternate syntaxes for
&quot;decode(&rsquo;utf8&rsquo;, ...)&quot; and
&quot;encode(&rsquo;utf8&rsquo;, ...)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is a &quot;wide
character&quot;? <br>
This is a term used both for characters with an ordinal
value greater than 127, characters with an ordinal value
greater than 255, or any character occupying more than one
byte, <br>
depending on the context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl warning &quot;Wide
character in ...&quot; is caused by a character with an
ordinal value greater than 255. With no specified encoding
layer, Perl tries to fit things in ISO-8859-1 <br>
for backward compatibility reasons. When it can&rsquo;t, it
emits this warning (if warnings are enabled), and outputs
UTF-8 encoded data instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid this warning and to
avoid having different output encodings in a single stream,
always specify an encoding explicitly, for example with a
PerlIO layer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binmode STDOUT,
&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNALS <br>
What is &quot;the UTF8 flag&quot;? <br>
Please, unless you&rsquo;re hacking the internals, or
debugging weirdness, don&rsquo;t think about the UTF8 flag
at all. That means that you very probably shouldn&rsquo;t
use &quot;is_utf8&quot;, &quot;_utf8_on&quot; <br>
or &quot;_utf8_off&quot; at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UTF8 flag, also called
SvUTF8, is an internal flag that indicates that the current
internal representation is UTF-8. Without the flag, it is
assumed to be ISO-8859-1. Perl <br>
converts between these automatically. (Actually Perl usually
assumes the representation is ASCII; see &quot;Why do regex
character classes sometimes match only in the ASCII
range?&quot; <br>
above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of Perl&rsquo;s internal
formats happens to be UTF-8. Unfortunately, Perl can&rsquo;t
keep a secret, so everyone knows about this. That is the
source of much confusion. It&rsquo;s better to <br>
pretend that the internal format is some unknown encoding,
and that you always have to encode and decode
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What about the &quot;use
bytes&quot; pragma? <br>
Don&rsquo;t use it. It makes no sense to deal with bytes in
a text string, and it makes no sense to deal with characters
in a byte string. Do the proper conversions (by <br>
decoding/encoding), and things will work out well: you get
character counts for decoded data, and byte counts for
encoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use bytes&quot; is usually
a failed attempt to do something useful. Just forget about
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What about the &quot;use
encoding&quot; pragma? <br>
Don&rsquo;t use it. Unfortunately, it assumes that the
programmer&rsquo;s environment and that of the user will use
the same encoding. It will use the same encoding for the
source code and <br>
for STDIN and STDOUT. When a program is copied to another
machine, the source code does not change, but the STDIO
environment might.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need non-ASCII characters
in your source code, make it a UTF-8 encoded file and
&quot;use utf8&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to set the encoding
for STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, for example based on the
user&rsquo;s locale, &quot;use open&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is the difference between
&quot;:encoding&quot; and &quot;:utf8&quot;? <br>
Because UTF-8 is one of Perl&rsquo;s internal formats, you
can often just skip the encoding or decoding step, and
manipulate the UTF8 flag directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of
&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;, you can simply use
&quot;:utf8&quot;, which skips the encoding step if the data
was already represented as UTF8 internally. This is widely
accepted as good <br>
behavior when you&rsquo;re writing, but it can be dangerous
when reading, because it causes internal inconsistency when
you have invalid byte sequences. Using &quot;:utf8&quot; for
input can <br>
sometimes result in security breaches, so please use
&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of &quot;decode&quot;
and &quot;encode&quot;, you could use &quot;_utf8_on&quot;
and &quot;_utf8_off&quot;, but this is considered bad style.
Especially &quot;_utf8_on&quot; can be dangerous, for the
same reason that <br>
&quot;:utf8&quot; can.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some shortcuts for
oneliners; see -C in perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s the difference
between &quot;UTF-8&quot; and &quot;utf8&quot;? <br>
&quot;UTF-8&quot; is the official standard. &quot;utf8&quot;
is Perl&rsquo;s way of being liberal in what it accepts. If
you have to communicate with things that aren&rsquo;t so
liberal, you may want to <br>
consider using &quot;UTF-8&quot;. If you have to communicate
with things that are too liberal, you may have to use
&quot;utf8&quot;. The full explanation is in Encode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UTF-8&quot; is internally
known as &quot;utf-8-strict&quot;. The tutorial uses UTF-8
consistently, even where utf8 is actually used internally,
because the distinction can be hard to make, and <br>
is mostly irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, utf8 can be used
for code points that don&rsquo;t exist in Unicode, like
9999999, but if you encode that to UTF-8, you get a
substitution character (by default; see <br>
&quot;Handling Malformed Data&quot; in Encode for more ways
of dealing with this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Okay, if you insist: the
&quot;internal format&quot; is utf8, not UTF-8. (When
it&rsquo;s not some other encoding.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I lost track; what encoding is
the internal format really? <br>
It&rsquo;s good that you lost track, because you
shouldn&rsquo;t depend on the internal format being any
specific encoding. But since you asked: by default, the
internal format is either <br>
ISO-8859-1 (latin-1), or utf8, depending on the history of
the string. On EBCDIC platforms, this may be different
even.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl knows how it stored the
string internally, and will use that knowledge when you
&quot;encode&quot;. In other words: don&rsquo;t try to find
out what the internal encoding for a certain <br>
string is, but instead just encode it into the encoding that
you want.</p>
