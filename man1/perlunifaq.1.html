perlunifaq - Perl Unicode FAQ
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Q_and_A"><a class="selflink" href="#Q_and_A">Q and
  A</a></h1>
This is a list of questions and answers about Unicode in Perl, intended to be
  read after perlunitut.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="perlunitut_isn't_really_a_Unicode_tutorial,_is_it?"><a class="selflink" href="#perlunitut_isn't_really_a_Unicode_tutorial,_is_it?">perlunitut
  isn't really a Unicode tutorial, is it?</a></h2>
No, and this isn't really a Unicode FAQ.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl has an abstracted interface for all supported character encodings, so this
  is actually a generic &quot;Encode&quot; tutorial and &quot;Encode&quot; FAQ.
  But many people think that Unicode is special and magical, and I didn't want
  to disappoint them, so I decided to call the document a Unicode tutorial.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_character_encodings_does_Perl_support?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_character_encodings_does_Perl_support?">What
  character encodings does Perl support?</a></h2>
To find out which character encodings your Perl supports, run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -MEncode -le &quot;print for Encode-&gt;encodings(':all')&quot;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Which_version_of_perl_should_I_use?"><a class="selflink" href="#Which_version_of_perl_should_I_use?">Which
  version of perl should I use?</a></h2>
Well, if you can, upgrade to the most recent, but certainly 5.8.1 or newer. The
  tutorial and FAQ assume the latest release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should also check your modules, and upgrade them if necessary. For example,
  HTML::Entities requires version &gt;= 1.32 to function correctly, even though
  the changelog is silent about this.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_about_binary_data,_like_images?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_about_binary_data,_like_images?">What
  about binary data, like images?</a></h2>
Well, apart from a bare &quot;binmode $fh&quot;, you shouldn't treat them
  specially. (The binmode is needed because otherwise Perl may convert line
  endings on Win32 systems.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be careful, though, to never combine text strings with binary strings. If you
  need text in a binary stream, encode your text strings first using the
  appropriate encoding, then join them with binary strings. See also: &quot;What
  if I don't encode?&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="When_should_I_decode_or_encode?"><a class="selflink" href="#When_should_I_decode_or_encode?">When
  should I decode or encode?</a></h2>
Whenever you're communicating text with anything that is external to your perl
  process, like a database, a text file, a socket, or another program. Even if
  the thing you're communicating with is also written in Perl.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_if_I_don't_decode?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_if_I_don't_decode?">What
  if I don't decode?</a></h2>
Whenever your encoded, binary string is used together with a text string, Perl
  will assume that your binary string was encoded with ISO-8859-1, also known as
  latin-1. If it wasn't latin-1, then your data is unpleasantly converted. For
  example, if it was UTF-8, the individual bytes of multibyte characters are
  seen as separate characters, and then again converted to UTF-8. Such double
  encoding can be compared to double HTML encoding (&quot;&amp;amp;gt;&quot;),
  or double URI encoding (%253E).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This silent implicit decoding is known as &quot;upgrading&quot;. That may sound
  positive, but it's best to avoid it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_if_I_don't_encode?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_if_I_don't_encode?">What
  if I don't encode?</a></h2>
Your text string will be sent using the bytes in Perl's internal format. In some
  cases, Perl will warn you that you're doing something wrong, with a friendly
  warning:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Wide character in print at example.pl line 2.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because the internal format is often UTF-8, these bugs are hard to spot, because
  UTF-8 is usually the encoding you wanted! But don't be lazy, and don't use the
  fact that Perl's internal format is UTF-8 to your advantage. Encode explicitly
  to avoid weird bugs, and to show to maintenance programmers that you thought
  this through.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Is_there_a_way_to_automatically_decode_or_encode?"><a class="selflink" href="#Is_there_a_way_to_automatically_decode_or_encode?">Is
  there a way to automatically decode or encode?</a></h2>
If all data that comes from a certain handle is encoded in exactly the same way,
  you can tell the PerlIO system to automatically decode everything, with the
  &quot;encoding&quot; layer. If you do this, you can't accidentally forget to
  decode or encode anymore, on things that use the layered handle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can provide this layer when &quot;open&quot;ing the file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  open my $fh, '&gt;:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename;  # auto encoding on write
  open my $fh, '&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename;  # auto decoding on read
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or if you already have an open filehandle:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  binmode $fh, ':encoding(UTF-8)';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some database drivers for DBI can also automatically encode and decode, but that
  is sometimes limited to the UTF-8 encoding.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_if_I_don't_know_which_encoding_was_used?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_if_I_don't_know_which_encoding_was_used?">What
  if I don't know which encoding was used?</a></h2>
Do whatever you can to find out, and if you have to: guess. (Don't forget to
  document your guess with a comment.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could open the document in a web browser, and change the character set or
  character encoding until you can visually confirm that all characters look the
  way they should.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no way to reliably detect the encoding automatically, so if people keep
  sending you data without charset indication, you may have to educate them.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_I_use_Unicode_in_my_Perl_sources?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_I_use_Unicode_in_my_Perl_sources?">Can
  I use Unicode in my Perl sources?</a></h2>
Yes, you can! If your sources are UTF-8 encoded, you can indicate that with the
  &quot;use utf8&quot; pragma.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use utf8;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This doesn't do anything to your input, or to your output. It only influences
  the way your sources are read. You can use Unicode in string literals, in
  identifiers (but they still have to be &quot;word characters&quot; according
  to &quot;\w&quot;), and even in custom delimiters.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Data::Dumper_doesn't_restore_the_UTF8_flag;_is_it_broken?"><a class="selflink" href="#Data::Dumper_doesn't_restore_the_UTF8_flag;_is_it_broken?">Data::Dumper
  doesn't restore the UTF8 flag; is it broken?</a></h2>
No, Data::Dumper's Unicode abilities are as they should be. There have been some
  complaints that it should restore the UTF8 flag when the data is read again
  with &quot;eval&quot;. However, you should really not look at the flag, and
  nothing indicates that Data::Dumper should break this rule.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's what happens: when Perl reads in a string literal, it sticks to 8 bit
  encoding as long as it can. (But perhaps originally it was internally encoded
  as UTF-8, when you dumped it.) When it has to give that up because other
  characters are added to the text string, it silently upgrades the string to
  UTF-8.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you properly encode your strings for output, none of this is of your concern,
  and you can just &quot;eval&quot; dumped data as always.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_do_regex_character_classes_sometimes_match_only_in_the_ASCII_range?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_do_regex_character_classes_sometimes_match_only_in_the_ASCII_range?">Why
  do regex character classes sometimes match only in the ASCII range?</a></h2>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_do_some_characters_not_uppercase_or_lowercase_correctly?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_do_some_characters_not_uppercase_or_lowercase_correctly?">Why
  do some characters not uppercase or lowercase correctly?</a></h2>
Starting in Perl 5.14 (and partially in Perl 5.12), just put a &quot;use feature
  'unicode_strings'&quot; near the beginning of your program. Within its lexical
  scope you shouldn't have this problem. It also is automatically enabled under
  &quot;use feature ':5.12'&quot; or using &quot;-E&quot; on the command line
  for Perl 5.12 or higher.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rationale for requiring this is to not break older programs that rely on the
  way things worked before Unicode came along. Those older programs knew only
  about the ASCII character set, and so may not work properly for additional
  characters. When a string is encoded in UTF-8, Perl assumes that the program
  is prepared to deal with Unicode, but when the string isn't, Perl assumes that
  only ASCII (unless it is an EBCDIC platform) is wanted, and so those
  characters that are not ASCII characters aren't recognized as to what they
  would be in Unicode. &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot; tells Perl to
  treat all characters as Unicode, whether the string is encoded in UTF-8 or
  not, thus avoiding the problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, on earlier Perls, or if you pass strings to subroutines outside the
  feature's scope, you can force Unicode semantics by changing the encoding to
  UTF-8 by doing &quot;utf8::upgrade($string)&quot;. This can be used safely on
  any string, as it checks and does not change strings that have already been
  upgraded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a more detailed discussion, see Unicode::Semantics on CPAN.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_can_I_determine_if_a_string_is_a_text_string_or_a_binary_string?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_can_I_determine_if_a_string_is_a_text_string_or_a_binary_string?">How
  can I determine if a string is a text string or a binary string?</a></h2>
You can't. Some use the UTF8 flag for this, but that's misuse, and makes well
  behaved modules like Data::Dumper look bad. The flag is useless for this
  purpose, because it's off when an 8 bit encoding (by default ISO-8859-1) is
  used to store the string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is something you, the programmer, has to keep track of; sorry. You could
  consider adopting a kind of &quot;Hungarian notation&quot; to help with this.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_convert_from_encoding_FOO_to_encoding_BAR?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_convert_from_encoding_FOO_to_encoding_BAR?">How
  do I convert from encoding FOO to encoding BAR?</a></h2>
By first converting the FOO-encoded byte string to a text string, and then the
  text string to a BAR-encoded byte string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $text_string = decode('FOO', $foo_string);
    my $bar_string  = encode('BAR', $text_string);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or by skipping the text string part, and going directly from one binary encoding
  to the other:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Encode qw(from_to);
    from_to($string, 'FOO', 'BAR');  # changes contents of $string
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or by letting automatic decoding and encoding do all the work:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    open my $foofh, '&lt;:encoding(FOO)', 'example.foo.txt';
    open my $barfh, '&gt;:encoding(BAR)', 'example.bar.txt';
    print { $barfh } $_ while &lt;$foofh&gt;;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_are_&quot;decode_utf8&quot;_and_&quot;encode_utf8&quot;?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_are_&quot;decode_utf8&quot;_and_&quot;encode_utf8&quot;?">What
  are &quot;decode_utf8&quot; and &quot;encode_utf8&quot;?</a></h2>
These are alternate syntaxes for &quot;decode('utf8', ...)&quot; and
  &quot;encode('utf8', ...)&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_a_&quot;wide_character&quot;?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_a_&quot;wide_character&quot;?">What
  is a &quot;wide character&quot;?</a></h2>
This is a term used both for characters with an ordinal value greater than 127,
  characters with an ordinal value greater than 255, or any character occupying
  more than one byte, depending on the context.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl warning &quot;Wide character in ...&quot; is caused by a character with
  an ordinal value greater than 255. With no specified encoding layer, Perl
  tries to fit things in ISO-8859-1 for backward compatibility reasons. When it
  can't, it emits this warning (if warnings are enabled), and outputs UTF-8
  encoded data instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To avoid this warning and to avoid having different output encodings in a single
  stream, always specify an encoding explicitly, for example with a PerlIO
  layer:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    binmode STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;;
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERNALS">INTERNALS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_&quot;the_UTF8_flag&quot;?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_&quot;the_UTF8_flag&quot;?">What
  is &quot;the UTF8 flag&quot;?</a></h2>
Please, unless you're hacking the internals, or debugging weirdness, don't think
  about the UTF8 flag at all. That means that you very probably shouldn't use
  &quot;is_utf8&quot;, &quot;_utf8_on&quot; or &quot;_utf8_off&quot; at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The UTF8 flag, also called SvUTF8, is an internal flag that indicates that the
  current internal representation is UTF-8. Without the flag, it is assumed to
  be ISO-8859-1. Perl converts between these automatically. (Actually Perl
  usually assumes the representation is ASCII; see &quot;Why do regex character
  classes sometimes match only in the ASCII range?&quot; above.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
One of Perl's internal formats happens to be UTF-8. Unfortunately, Perl can't
  keep a secret, so everyone knows about this. That is the source of much
  confusion. It's better to pretend that the internal format is some unknown
  encoding, and that you always have to encode and decode explicitly.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_about_the_&quot;use_bytes&quot;_pragma?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_about_the_&quot;use_bytes&quot;_pragma?">What
  about the &quot;use bytes&quot; pragma?</a></h2>
Don't use it. It makes no sense to deal with bytes in a text string, and it
  makes no sense to deal with characters in a byte string. Do the proper
  conversions (by decoding/encoding), and things will work out well: you get
  character counts for decoded data, and byte counts for encoded data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;use bytes&quot; is usually a failed attempt to do something useful. Just
  forget about it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_about_the_&quot;use_encoding&quot;_pragma?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_about_the_&quot;use_encoding&quot;_pragma?">What
  about the &quot;use encoding&quot; pragma?</a></h2>
Don't use it. Unfortunately, it assumes that the programmer's environment and
  that of the user will use the same encoding. It will use the same encoding for
  the source code and for STDIN and STDOUT. When a program is copied to another
  machine, the source code does not change, but the STDIO environment might.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need non-ASCII characters in your source code, make it a UTF-8 encoded
  file and &quot;use utf8&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need to set the encoding for STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, for example based
  on the user's locale, &quot;use open&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_the_difference_between_&quot;:encoding&quot;_and_&quot;:utf8&quot;?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_the_difference_between_&quot;:encoding&quot;_and_&quot;:utf8&quot;?">What
  is the difference between &quot;:encoding&quot; and
  &quot;:utf8&quot;?</a></h2>
Because UTF-8 is one of Perl's internal formats, you can often just skip the
  encoding or decoding step, and manipulate the UTF8 flag directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;, you can simply use &quot;:utf8&quot;,
  which skips the encoding step if the data was already represented as UTF8
  internally. This is widely accepted as good behavior when you're writing, but
  it can be dangerous when reading, because it causes internal inconsistency
  when you have invalid byte sequences. Using &quot;:utf8&quot; for input can
  sometimes result in security breaches, so please use
  &quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot; instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of &quot;decode&quot; and &quot;encode&quot;, you could use
  &quot;_utf8_on&quot; and &quot;_utf8_off&quot;, but this is considered bad
  style. Especially &quot;_utf8_on&quot; can be dangerous, for the same reason
  that &quot;:utf8&quot; can.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some shortcuts for oneliners; see -C in perlrun.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What's_the_difference_between_&quot;UTF-8&quot;_and_&quot;utf8&quot;?"><a class="selflink" href="#What's_the_difference_between_&quot;UTF-8&quot;_and_&quot;utf8&quot;?">What's
  the difference between &quot;UTF-8&quot; and &quot;utf8&quot;?</a></h2>
&quot;UTF-8&quot; is the official standard. &quot;utf8&quot; is Perl's way of
  being liberal in what it accepts. If you have to communicate with things that
  aren't so liberal, you may want to consider using &quot;UTF-8&quot;. If you
  have to communicate with things that are too liberal, you may have to use
  &quot;utf8&quot;. The full explanation is in Encode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;UTF-8&quot; is internally known as &quot;utf-8-strict&quot;. The tutorial
  uses UTF-8 consistently, even where utf8 is actually used internally, because
  the distinction can be hard to make, and is mostly irrelevant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, utf8 can be used for code points that don't exist in Unicode, like
  9999999, but if you encode that to UTF-8, you get a substitution character (by
  default; see &quot;Handling Malformed Data&quot; in Encode for more ways of
  dealing with this.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Okay, if you insist: the &quot;internal format&quot; is utf8, not UTF-8. (When
  it's not some other encoding.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="I_lost_track;_what_encoding_is_the_internal_format_really?"><a class="selflink" href="#I_lost_track;_what_encoding_is_the_internal_format_really?">I
  lost track; what encoding is the internal format really?</a></h2>
It's good that you lost track, because you shouldn't depend on the internal
  format being any specific encoding. But since you asked: by default, the
  internal format is either ISO-8859-1 (latin-1), or utf8, depending on the
  history of the string. On EBCDIC platforms, this may be different even.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl knows how it stored the string internally, and will use that knowledge when
  you &quot;encode&quot;. In other words: don't try to find out what the
  internal encoding for a certain string is, but instead just encode it into the
  encoding that you want.
