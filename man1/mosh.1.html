<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mosh - mobile shell with roaming and intelligent local
echo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mosh [options] [--] [user@]host [command...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mosh (mobile shell) is a remote terminal application that
supports intermittent connectivity, allows roaming, and
provides speculative local echo and line editing of user
key&acirc; <br>
strokes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compared with ssh, mosh is more
robust &acirc; its connections stay up across sleeps and
changes in the client&rsquo;s IP address &acirc; and more
responsive, because the protocol is tolerant of <br>
packet loss and the client can echo most keystrokes
immediately, without waiting for a network round-trip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mosh uses ssh to establish a
connection to the remote host and authenticate with existing
means (e.g., public-key authentication or a password). mosh
executes the unprivileged <br>
mosh-server helper program on the server, then closes the
SSH connection and starts the mosh-client, which establishes
a long-lived datagram connection over UDP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To improve responsiveness, mosh
runs a predictive model of the server&rsquo;s behavior in
the background, trying to guess the effect of each keystroke
on the screen. It makes predic&acirc; <br>
tions for normal typing, backspace, and the left- and
right-arrow keys. When it is confident, mosh displays the
predictions without waiting for the server. The predictive
model <br>
must prove itself anew on each row of the terminal and after
each control character, so mosh avoids echoing passwords or
non-echoing editor commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, mosh shows its
predictions only on high-latency connections and to smooth
out network glitches. (On longer-latency links, the
predicted cells are underlined until <br>
confirmed by the server.) Occasional echo mistakes are
corrected within a network round-trip and do not cause
lasting effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mosh does not support X
forwarding or the non-interactive uses of SSH, including
port forwarding or sshfs. mosh works through typical
client-side network address translators but <br>
requires UDP to pass between client and server. By default,
mosh uses the ports between 60000 and 61000, but allows the
user to request a particular UDP port instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, mosh has limited
support for IPv6, dual-stack networks, and servers with
multiple addresses. At session start, it will select a
single IPv4 or IPv6 server address to <br>
connect to for the lifetime of the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mosh will do its best to arrange
a UTF-8 character set locale on the client and server. The
client must have locale-related environment variables that
specify UTF-8. mosh will <br>
pass these client variables to the mosh-server on its
command line, but in most cases they will not need to be
used. mosh-server first attempts to use its own
locale-related <br>
environment variables, which come from the system default
configuration (sometimes /etc/default/locale) or from having
been passed over the SSH connection. But if these variables
<br>
don&rsquo;t call for the use of UTF-8, mosh-server will
apply the locale-related environment variables from the
client and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options named --experimental-* are subject to change or
removal in future versions of Mosh; their design or function
is not yet final.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command <br>
Command to run on remote host. By default, mosh executes a
login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--client=PATH <br>
path to client helper on local machine (default:
&quot;mosh-client&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server=COMMAND <br>
command to run server helper on remote machine (default:
&quot;mosh-server&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server helper is
unprivileged and can be installed in the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to set
environment variables for the server by using the env(1)
command to wrap the actual server command. See
mosh-server(1) for available envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssh=COMMAND <br>
OpenSSH command to remotely execute mosh-server on remote
machine (default: &quot;ssh&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternate ssh port can be
specified with, e.g., --ssh=&quot;ssh -p 2222&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssh-pty <br>
--no-ssh-pty Enable or disable ssh&rsquo;s use of a pty when
connecting to a remote host. The default is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--predict=WHEN <br>
Controls use of speculative local echo. WHEN defaults to
&lsquo;adaptive&rsquo; (show predictions on slower links and
to smooth out network glitches) and can also be
&lsquo;always&lsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;never&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY
environment variable controls this setting permanently and
can adopt the same three values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even on &lsquo;always&rsquo;,
mosh will only show predictions when it is confident. This
generally means a previous prediction on the same row of the
terminal has been confirmed by <br>
the server, without any intervening control character
keystrokes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Synonym for
--predict=always</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Synonym for
--predict=never</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family=inet <br>
Only use IPv4 for the SSH connection and Mosh session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family=inet6 <br>
Only use IPv6 for the SSH connection and Mosh session. This
and the following modes require Perl&rsquo;s IO::Socket::IP
or IO::Socket::INET6 modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family=auto <br>
Autodetect IPv4 or IPv6 for hosts that only have addresses
in a single family. Hosts with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
will raise an error, and require re-invocation of <br>
mosh with another --family option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family=all <br>
Choose an address from all available IPv4 or IPv6 address,
even for dual-stack hosts. This is the most convenient
option, but requires dual-stack connectivity, and Mosh <br>
1.2.5 or later on the server, when roaming with dual-stack
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family=prefer-inet <br>
Similar to --family=all, but attempt connects to the IPv4
addresses first. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--family=prefer-inet6 <br>
Similar to --family=all, but attempt connects to the IPv6
addresses first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Synonym for --family=inet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Synonym for
--family=inet6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PORT[:PORT2],
--port=PORT[:PORT2] <br>
Use a particular server-side UDP port or port range, for
example, if this is the only port that is forwarded through
a firewall to the server. With -p 0, the server will <br>
let the operating system pick an available UDP port.
Otherwise, mosh will choose a port between 60000 and 61000.
Please note that this option does not affect the server-
<br>
side port used by SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bind-server={ssh|any|IP} <br>
Control the IP address that the mosh-server binds to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
&lsquo;ssh&rsquo;, in which case the server will reply from
the IP address that the SSH connection came from (as found
in the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable). This <br>
is useful for multihomed servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --bind-server=any, the
server will reply on the default interface and will not bind
to a particular IP address. This can be useful if the
connection is made through <br>
sslh or another tool that makes the SSH connection appear to
come from localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --bind-server=IP, the
server will attempt to bind to the specified IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-init <br>
Do not send the smcup initialization string and rmcup
deinitialization string to the client&rsquo;s terminal. On
many terminals this disables alternate screen mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local <br>
Invoke mosh-server locally, without using ssh. This option
requires the host argument to be a local, numeric IPv4/IPv6
address. This option is useful for testing.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--experimental-remote-ip={proxy|local|remote}
<br>
Select the method used to discover the IP address that the
mosh-client connects to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is proxy, which uses
SSH&rsquo;s --ssh-proxy-command option to generate and
report the exact address that ssh uses to connect to the
remote host. This option is <br>
generally the most compatible with hosts and other options
configured in ssh configuration files. However, this may not
work for some configurations, or for environments <br>
where a ssh bastion host forwards to a remote machine. It
only works with OpenSSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With remote, the server&rsquo;s
SSH_CONNECTION environment variable will be used. This is
useful for environments where ssh forwarding is used, or the
--ssh-proxy-command <br>
option is used for other purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With local, Mosh resolves the
hostname given on its command line, and uses that address
for both ssh and Mosh connections. This option ignores any
configuration in <br>
ssh_config for the same hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCAPE SEQUENCES <br>
The default escape character used by Mosh is ASCII RS
(decimal 30). This is typically typed as Ctrl-^ or
Ctrl-Shift-6, on US English keyboards. Users of non-English
keyboards <br>
may find it difficult or impossible to type the default
escape character, and may need to change the escape
character. See the description of MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY, below. In
this <br>
description, the configured escape character is represented
as Esc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two slightly different
modes for escape sequences, depending whether the escape
character is printable or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the escape character is a
printable character, it must be prefixed with a newline,
similar to OpenSSH. To send the escape character itself,
type it twice. If the escape <br>
character is set to ~, mosh will behave much like
OpenSSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the escape character is a
non-printable control character, no prefix is used and the
escape character is recognized at any time. To send the
escape character itself, type the <br>
escape character, then its corresponding ASCII character
(for Ctrl-^ you would type ^, for Ctrl-B you would type
B).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The escape sequence to shut down
the connection is Esc .. The sequence Esc Ctrl-Z suspends
the client. Any other sequence passes both characters
through to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
These variables are not actually interpreted by mosh(1)
itself, but are passed through to mosh-server(1). They are
described here for ease of use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY <br>
When set, this configures the escape character used for
local commands. The escape character may be set to any ASCII
character in the range 1-127. The variable must be <br>
set with a single literal ASCII character. Control
characters are set with the actual ASCII control character,
not with a printable representation such as
&quot;^B&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY <br>
Controls local echo as described above. The command-line
flag overrides this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOSH_TITLE_NOPREFIX <br>
When set, inhibits prepending &quot;[mosh]&quot; to window
title.</p>
