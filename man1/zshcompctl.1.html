<p>ZSHCOMPCTL(1) General Commands Manual ZSHCOMPCTL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshcompctl - zsh programmable completion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This version of zsh has two ways of performing completion of
words on the command line. New users of the shell may prefer
to use the newer and more powerful system based on <br>
shell functions; this is described in zshcompsys(1), and the
basic shell mechanisms which support it are described in
zshcompwid(1). This manual entry describes the older
com&acirc; <br>
pctl command. <br>
compctl [ -CDT ] options [ command ... ] <br>
compctl [ -CDT ] options [ -x pattern options - ... -- ] [ +
options [ -x ... -- ] ... [+] ] [ command ... ] <br>
compctl -M match-specs ... <br>
compctl -L [ -CDTM ] [ command ... ] <br>
compctl + command ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control the editor&rsquo;s
completion behavior according to the supplied set of
options. Various editing commands, notably
expand-or-complete-word, usually bound to tab, will attempt
<br>
to complete a word typed by the user, while others, notably
delete-char-or-list, usually bound to ^D in EMACS editing
mode, list the possibilities; compctl controls what those
<br>
possibilities are. They may for example be filenames (the
most common case, and hence the default), shell variables,
or words from a user-specified list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND FLAGS <br>
Completion of the arguments of a command may be different
for each command or may use the default. The behavior when
completing the command word itself may also be separately
<br>
specified. These correspond to the following flags and
arguments, all of which (except for -L) may be combined with
any combination of the options described subsequently in the
<br>
section &lsquo;Option Flags&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command ... <br>
controls completion for the named commands, which must be
listed last on the command line. If completion is attempted
for a command with a pathname containing slashes and <br>
no completion definition is found, the search is retried
with the last pathname component. If the command starts with
a =, completion is tried with the pathname of the <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any of the command strings may
be patterns of the form normally used for filename
generation. These should be quoted to protect them from
immediate expansion; for example <br>
the command string &rsquo;foo*&rsquo; arranges for
completion of the words of any command beginning with foo.
When completion is attempted, all pattern completions are
tried in the <br>
reverse order of their definition until one matches. By
default, completion then proceeds as normal, i.e. the shell
will try to generate more matches for the specific <br>
command on the command line; this can be overridden by
including -tn in the flags for the pattern completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that aliases are expanded
before the command name is determined unless the
COMPLETE_ALIASES option is set. Commands may not be combined
with the -C, -D or -T flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C controls completion when the
command word itself is being completed. If no compctl -C
command has been issued, the names of any executable command
(whether in the path <br>
or specific to the shell, such as aliases or functions) are
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D controls default completion
behavior for the arguments of commands not assigned any
special behavior. If no compctl -D command has been issued,
filenames are completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T supplies completion flags to
be used before any other processing is done, even before
processing for compctls defined for specific commands. This
is especially useful <br>
when combined with extended completion (the -x flag, see the
section &lsquo;Extended Completion&rsquo; below). Using this
flag you can define default behavior which will apply to all
<br>
commands without exception, or you can alter the standard
behavior for all commands. For example, if your access to
the user database is too slow and/or it contains too <br>
many users (so that completion after &lsquo;~&rsquo; is too
slow to be usable), you can use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -T -x &rsquo;s[~]
C[0,[^/]#]&rsquo; -k friends -S/ -tn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to complete the strings in the
array friends after a &lsquo;~&rsquo;. The C[...] argument
is necessary so that this form of ~-completion is not tried
after the directory name is fin&acirc; <br>
ished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L lists the existing completion
behavior in a manner suitable for putting into a start-up
script; the existing behavior is not changed. Any
combination of the above forms, <br>
or the -M flag (which must follow the -L flag), may be
specified, otherwise all defined completions are listed. Any
other flags supplied are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no argument <br>
If no argument is given, compctl lists all defined
completions in an abbreviated form; with a list of options,
all completions with those flags set (not counting extended
<br>
completion) are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the + flag is alone and
followed immediately by the command list, the completion
behavior for all the commands in the list is reset to the
default. In other words, completion <br>
will subsequently use the options specified by the -D
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The form with -M as the first
and only option defines global matching specifications (see
zshcompwid). The match specifications given will be used for
every completion attempt <br>
(only when using compctl, not with the new completion
system) and are tried in the order in which they are defined
until one generates at least one match. E.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -M &rsquo;&rsquo;
&rsquo;m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will first try completion
without any global match specifications (the empty string)
and, if that generates no matches, will try case insensitive
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION FLAGS <br>
[ -fcFBdeaRGovNAIOPZEnbjrzu/12 ] <br>
[ -k array ] [ -g globstring ] [ -s subststring ] <br>
[ -K function ] <br>
[ -Q ] [ -P prefix ] [ -S suffix ] <br>
[ -W file-prefix ] [ -H num pattern ] <br>
[ -q ] [ -X explanation ] [ -Y explanation ] <br>
[ -y func-or-var ] [ -l cmd ] [ -h cmd ] [ -U ] <br>
[ -t continue ] [ -J name ] [ -V name ] <br>
[ -M match-spec ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining options specify
the type of command arguments to look for during completion.
Any combination of these flags may be specified; the result
is a sorted list of all <br>
the possibilities. The options are as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple Flags <br>
These produce completion lists made up by the shell
itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Filenames and file system
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-/ Just file system paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Command names, including
aliases, shell functions, builtins and reserved words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Function names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Names of builtin
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Names of external
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Reserved words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Alias names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Names of regular (non-global)
aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Names of global aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d This can be combined with -F,
-B, -w, -a, -R and -G to get names of disabled functions,
builtins, reserved words or aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e This option (to show enabled
commands) is in effect by default, but may be combined with
-d; -de in combination with -F, -B, -w, -a, -R and -G will
complete names of func&acirc; <br>
tions, builtins, reserved words or aliases whether or not
they are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Names of shell options (see
zshoptions(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Names of any variable defined
in the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Names of scalar (non-array)
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Array names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Names of integer
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Names of read-only
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Names of parameters used by
the shell (including special parameters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Names of shell special
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Names of environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Named directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Key binding names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Job names: the first word of
the job leader&rsquo;s command line. This is useful with the
kill builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Names of running jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Names of suspended jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u User names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags with Arguments <br>
These have user supplied arguments to determine how the list
of completions is to be made up:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k array <br>
Names taken from the elements of $array (note that the
&lsquo;$&rsquo; does not appear on the command line).
Alternatively, the argument array itself may be a set of
space- or <br>
comma-separated values in parentheses, in which any
delimiter may be escaped with a backslash; in this case the
argument should be quoted. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -k &quot;(cputime
filesize datasize stacksize <br>
coredumpsize resident descriptors)&quot; limit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g globstring <br>
The globstring is expanded using filename globbing; it
should be quoted to protect it from immediate expansion. The
resulting filenames are taken as the possible comple&acirc;
<br>
tions. Use &lsquo;*(/)&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;*/&rsquo;
for directories. The fignore special parameter is not
applied to the resulting files. More than one pattern may be
given separated by <br>
blanks. (Note that brace expansion is not part of globbing.
Use the syntax &lsquo;(either|or)&rsquo; to match
alternatives.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s subststring <br>
The subststring is split into words and these words are than
expanded using all shell expansion mechanisms (see
zshexpn(1)). The resulting words are taken as possible <br>
completions. The fignore special parameter is not applied to
the resulting files. Note that -g is faster for
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K function <br>
Call the given function to get the completions. Unless the
name starts with an underscore, the function is passed two
arguments: the prefix and the suffix of the word on <br>
which completion is to be attempted, in other words those
characters before the cursor position, and those from the
cursor position onwards. The whole command line can be <br>
accessed with the -c and -l flags of the read builtin. The
function should set the variable reply to an array
containing the completions (one completion per element);
note <br>
that reply should not be made local to the function. From
such a function the command line can be accessed with the -c
and -l flags to the read builtin. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function whoson {
reply=(&lsquo;users&lsquo;); } <br>
compctl -K whoson talk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes only logged-on users
after &lsquo;talk&rsquo;. Note that &lsquo;whoson&rsquo;
must return an array, so
&lsquo;reply=&lsquo;users&lsquo;&rsquo; would be
incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H num pattern <br>
The possible completions are taken from the last num history
lines. Only words matching pattern are taken. If num is zero
or negative the whole history is searched and <br>
if pattern is the empty string all words are taken (as with
&lsquo;*&rsquo;). A typical use is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -D -f + -H 0
&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which forces completion to look
back in the history list for a word if no filename
matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control Flags <br>
These do not directly specify types of name to be completed,
but manipulate the options that do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q This instructs the shell not
to quote any metacharacters in the possible completions.
Normally the results of a completion are inserted into the
command line with any <br>
metacharacters quoted so that they are interpreted as normal
characters. This is appropriate for filenames and ordinary
strings. However, for special effects, such as <br>
inserting a backquoted expression from a completion array
(-k) so that the expression will not be evaluated until the
complete line is executed, this option must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P prefix <br>
The prefix is inserted just before the completed string; any
initial part already typed will be completed and the whole
prefix ignored for completion purposes. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -j -P &quot;%&quot;
kill</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inserts a &lsquo;%&rsquo; after
the kill command and then completes job names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S suffix <br>
When a completion is found the suffix is inserted after the
completed string. In the case of menu completion the suffix
is inserted immediately, but it is still possible <br>
to cycle through the list of completions by repeatedly
hitting the same key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W file-prefix <br>
With directory file-prefix: for command, file, directory and
globbing completion (options -c, -f, -/, -g), the file
prefix is implicitly added in front of the completion. <br>
For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -/ -W ~/Mail
maildirs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes any subdirectories to
any depth beneath the directory ~/Mail, although that prefix
does not appear on the command line. The file-prefix may
also be of the form <br>
accepted by the -k flag, i.e. the name of an array or a
literal list in parenthesis. In this case all the
directories in the list will be searched for possible
comple&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q If used with a suffix as
specified by the -S option, this causes the suffix to be
removed if the next character typed is a blank or does not
insert anything or if the suf&acirc; <br>
fix consists of only one character and the next character
typed is the same character; this the same rule used for the
AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH option. The option is most useful <br>
for list separators (comma, colon, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l cmd This option restricts the
range of command line words that are considered to be
arguments. If combined with one of the extended completion
patterns &lsquo;p[...]&rsquo;, &lsquo;r[...]&rsquo;, or <br>
&lsquo;R[...]&rsquo; (see the section &lsquo;Extended
Completion&rsquo; below) the range is restricted to the
range of arguments specified in the brackets. Completion is
then performed as if <br>
these had been given as arguments to the cmd supplied with
the option. If the cmd string is empty the first word in the
range is instead taken as the command name, and <br>
command name completion performed on the first word in the
range. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -x
&rsquo;r[-exec,;]&rsquo; -l &rsquo;&rsquo; -- find</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes arguments between
&lsquo;-exec&rsquo; and the following &lsquo;;&rsquo; (or
the end of the command line if there is no such string) as
if they were a separate command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h cmd Normally zsh completes
quoted strings as a whole. With this option, completion can
be done separately on different parts of such strings. It
works like the -l option but <br>
makes the completion code work on the parts of the current
word that are separated by spaces. These parts are completed
as if they were arguments to the given cmd. If cmd <br>
is the empty string, the first part is completed as a
command name, as with -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Use the whole list of
possible completions, whether or not they actually match the
word on the command line. The word typed so far will be
deleted. This is most useful <br>
with a function (given by the -K option) which can examine
the word components passed to it (or via the read
builtin&rsquo;s -c and -l flags) and use its own criteria to
decide <br>
what matches. If there is no completion, the original word
is retained. Since the produced possible completions seldom
have interesting common prefixes and suffixes, <br>
menu completion is started immediately if AUTO_MENU is set
and this flag is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y func-or-var <br>
The list provided by func-or-var is displayed instead of the
list of completions whenever a listing is required; the
actual completions to be inserted are not affected. <br>
It can be provided in two ways. Firstly, if func-or-var
begins with a $ it defines a variable, or if it begins with
a left parenthesis a literal array, which contains the <br>
list. A variable may have been set by a call to a function
using the -K option. Otherwise it contains the name of a
function which will be executed to create the list. <br>
The function will be passed as an argument list all matching
completions, including prefixes and suffixes expanded in
full, and should set the array reply to the result. <br>
In both cases, the display list will only be retrieved after
a complete list of matches has been created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the returned list does
not have to correspond, even in length, to the original set
of matches, and may be passed as a scalar instead of an
array. No special <br>
formatting of characters is performed on the output in this
case; in particular, newlines are printed literally and if
they appear output in columns is suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X explanation <br>
Print explanation when trying completion on the current set
of options. A &lsquo;%n&rsquo; in this string is replaced by
the number of matches that were added for this explanation
<br>
string. The explanation only appears if completion was tried
and there was no unique match, or when listing completions.
Explanation strings will be listed together with <br>
the matches of the group specified together with the -X
option (using the -J or -V option). If the same explanation
string is given to multiple -X options, the string <br>
appears only once (for each group) and the number of matches
shown for the &lsquo;%n&rsquo; is the total number of all
matches for each of these uses. In any case, the explanation
<br>
string will only be shown if there was at least one match
added for the explanation string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sequences %B, %b, %S, %s,
%U, and %u specify output attributes (bold, standout, and
underline), %F, %f, %K, %k specify foreground and background
colours, and %{...%} <br>
can be used to include literal escape sequences as in
prompts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y explanation <br>
Identical to -X, except that the explanation first undergoes
expansion following the usual rules for strings in double
quotes. The expansion will be carried out after any <br>
functions are called for the -K or -y options, allowing them
to set variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t continue <br>
The continue-string contains a character that specifies
which set of completion flags should be used next. It is
useful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i) With -T, or when trying a
list of pattern completions, when compctl would usually
continue with ordinary processing after finding matches;
this can be suppressed with <br>
&lsquo;-tn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(ii) With a list of alternatives
separated by +, when compctl would normally stop when one of
the alternatives generates matches. It can be forced to
consider the next <br>
set of completions by adding &lsquo;-t+&rsquo; to the flags
of the alternative before the &lsquo;+&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(iii) In an extended completion
list (see below), when compctl would normally continue until
a set of conditions succeeded, then use only the immediately
following flags. <br>
With &lsquo;-t-&rsquo;, compctl will continue trying
extended completions after the next &lsquo;-&rsquo;; with
&lsquo;-tx&rsquo; it will attempt completion with the
default flags, in other words those before <br>
the &lsquo;-x&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J name <br>
This gives the name of the group the matches should be
placed in. Groups are listed and sorted separately;
likewise, menu completion will offer the matches in the
groups <br>
in the order in which the groups were defined. If no group
name is explicitly given, the matches are stored in a group
named default. The first time a group name is <br>
encountered, a group with that name is created. After that
all matches with the same group name are stored in that
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful with
non-exclusive alternative completions. For example, in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -f -J files -t+ + -v -J
variables foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">both files and variables are
possible completions, as the -t+ forces both sets of
alternatives before and after the + to be considered at
once. Because of the -J options, <br>
however, all files are listed before all variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V name <br>
Like -J, but matches within the group will not be sorted in
listings nor in menu completion. These unsorted groups are
in a different name space from the sorted ones, so <br>
groups defined as -J files and -V files are distinct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 If given together with the -V
option, makes only consecutive duplicates in the group be
removed. Note that groups with and without this flag are in
different name spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 If given together with the -J
or -V option, makes all duplicates be kept. Again, groups
with and without this flag are in different name spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M match-spec <br>
This defines additional matching control specifications that
should be used only when testing words for the list of flags
this flag appears in. The format of the <br>
match-spec string is described in zshcompwid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALTERNATIVE COMPLETION <br>
compctl [ -CDT ] options + options [ + ... ] [ + ] command
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The form with &lsquo;+&rsquo;
specifies alternative options. Completion is tried with the
options before the first &lsquo;+&rsquo;. If this produces
no matches completion is tried with the flags after <br>
the &lsquo;+&rsquo; and so on. If there are no flags after
the last &lsquo;+&rsquo; and a match has not been found up
to that point, default completion is tried. If the list of
flags contains a -t with <br>
a + character, the next list of flags is used even if the
current list produced matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional options are available
that restrict completion to some part of the command line;
this is referred to as &lsquo;extended
completion&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED COMPLETION <br>
compctl [ -CDT ] options -x pattern options - ... -- <br>
[ command ... ] <br>
compctl [ -CDT ] options [ -x pattern options - ... -- ]
<br>
[ + options [ -x ... -- ] ... [+] ] [ command ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The form with &lsquo;-x&rsquo;
specifies extended completion for the commands given; as
shown, it may be combined with alternative completion using
&lsquo;+&rsquo;. Each pattern is examined in turn; <br>
when a match is found, the corresponding options, as
described in the section &lsquo;Option Flags&rsquo; above,
are used to generate possible completions. If no pattern
matches, the options <br>
given before the -x are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that each pattern should be
supplied as a single argument and should be quoted to
prevent expansion of metacharacters by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pattern is built of
sub-patterns separated by commas; it matches if at least one
of these sub-patterns matches (they are &lsquo;or&rsquo;ed).
These sub-patterns are in turn composed of <br>
other sub-patterns separated by white spaces which match if
all of the sub-patterns match (they are
&lsquo;and&rsquo;ed). An element of the sub-patterns is of
the form &lsquo;c[...][...]&rsquo;, where <br>
the pairs of brackets may be repeated as often as necessary,
and matches if any of the sets of brackets match (an
&lsquo;or&rsquo;). The example below makes this clearer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The elements may be any of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s[string]... <br>
Matches if the current word on the command line starts with
one of the strings given in brackets. The string is not
removed and is not part of the completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S[string]... <br>
Like s[string] except that the string is part of the
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p[from,to]... <br>
Matches if the number of the current word is between one of
the from and to pairs inclusive. The comma and to are
optional; to defaults to the same value as from. The <br>
numbers may be negative: -n refers to the n&rsquo;th last
word on the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c[offset,string]... <br>
Matches if the string matches the word offset by offset from
the current word position. Usually offset will be
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C[offset,pattern]... <br>
Like c but using pattern matching instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w[index,string]... <br>
Matches if the word in position index is equal to the
corresponding string. Note that the word count is made after
any alias expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W[index,pattern]... <br>
Like w but using pattern matching instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n[index,string]... <br>
Matches if the current word contains string. Anything up to
and including the indexth occurrence of this string will not
be considered part of the completion, but the <br>
rest will. index may be negative to count from the end: in
most cases, index will be 1 or -1. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compctl -s
&rsquo;&lsquo;users&lsquo;&rsquo; -x &rsquo;n[1,@]&rsquo; -k
hosts -- talk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will usually complete usernames,
but if you insert an @ after the name, names from the array
hosts (assumed to contain hostnames, though you must make
the array yourself) <br>
will be completed. Other commands such as rcp can be handled
similarly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N[index,string]... <br>
Like n except that the string will be taken as a character
class. Anything up to and including the indexth occurrence
of any of the characters in string will not be con&acirc;
<br>
sidered part of the completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m[min,max]... <br>
Matches if the total number of words lies between min and
max inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r[str1,str2]... <br>
Matches if the cursor is after a word with prefix str1. If
there is also a word with prefix str2 on the command line
after the one matched by str1 it matches only if the <br>
cursor is before this word. If the comma and str2 are
omitted, it matches if the cursor is after a word with
prefix str1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R[str1,str2]... <br>
Like r but using pattern matching instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q[str]... <br>
Matches the word currently being completed is in single
quotes and the str begins with the letter &lsquo;s&rsquo;,
or if completion is done in double quotes and str starts
with the <br>
letter &lsquo;d&rsquo;, or if completion is done in
backticks and str starts with a &lsquo;b&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
compctl -u -x &rsquo;s[+] c[-1,-f],s[-f+]&rsquo; -g
&rsquo;~/Mail/*(:t)&rsquo; - &rsquo;s[-f],c[-1,-f]&rsquo; -f
-- mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is to be interpreted as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the current command is mail,
then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ((the current word begins
with + and the previous word is -f) <br>
or (the current word begins with -f+)), then complete the
<br>
non-directory part (the &lsquo;:t&rsquo; glob modifier) of
files in the directory <br>
~/Mail; else</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the current word begins with
-f or the previous word was -f, then <br>
complete any file; else</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete user names.</p>
