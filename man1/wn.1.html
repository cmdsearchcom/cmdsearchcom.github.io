<p>WN(1) WordNet&acirc;&cent; User Commands WN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wn - command line interface to WordNet lexical database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wn [ searchstr ] [ -h] [ -g ] [ -a ] [ -l ] [ -o ] [ -s ] [
-n# ] [ search_option... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wn() provides a command line interface to the WordNet
database, allowing synsets and relations to be displayed as
formatted text. For each word, different searches are
provided, <br>
based on syntactic category and pointer types. Although only
base forms of words are usually stored in WordNet, users may
search for inflected forms. A morphological process is <br>
applied to the search string to generate a form that is
present in WordNet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line interface is
often useful when writing scripts to extract information
from the WordNet database. Post-processing of the output
with various scripting tools can <br>
reformat the results as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print help text before search results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Display textual glosses
associated with synsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Display lexicographer file
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Display synset offset of each
synset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Display each word&rsquo;s
sense numbers in synsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Display the WordNet copyright
notice, version number, and license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n# Perform search on sense
number # only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-over Display overview of all
senses of searchstr in all syntactic categories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search Options <br>
Note that the last letter of search_option generally denotes
the part of speech that the search applies to: n for nouns,
v for verbs, a for adjectives, and r for adverbs.
Multi&acirc; <br>
ple searches may be done for searchstr with a single command
by specifying all the appropriate search options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syns(n | v | a | r) <br>
Display synonyms and immediate hypernyms of synsets
containing searchstr. Synsets are ordered by estimated
frequency of use. For adjectives, if searchstr is in a <br>
head synset, the cluster&rsquo;s satellite synsets are
displayed in place of hypernyms. If searchstr is in a
satellite synset, its head synset is also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-simsv Display verb synonyms and
immediate hypernyms of synsets containing searchstr. Synsets
are grouped by similarity of meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ants(n | v | a | r) <br>
Display synsets containing antonyms of searchstr. For
adjectives, if searchstr is in a head synset, searchstr has
a direct antonym. The head synset for the <br>
direct antonym is displayed along with the direct
antonym&rsquo;s satellite synsets. If searchstr is in a
satellite synset, searchstr has an indirect antonym via the
<br>
head synset, which is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-faml(n | v | a | r) <br>
Display familiarity and polysemy information for
searchstr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hype(n | v) Recursively display
hypernym (superordinate) tree for searchstr (searchstr IS A
KIND OF _____ relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hypo(n | v) Display immediate
hyponyms (subordinates) for searchstr (_____ IS A KIND OF
searchstr relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tree(n | v) Display hyponym
(subordinate) tree for searchstr. This is a recursive search
that finds the hyponyms of each hyponym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-coor(n | v) Display the
coordinates (sisters) of searchstr. This search prints the
immediate hypernym for each synset that contains searchstr
and the hypernym&rsquo;s immediate <br>
hyponyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-deri(n | v) Display
derivational morphology links between noun and verb
forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-domn(n | v | a | r) <br>
Display domain that searchstr has been classified in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-domt(n | v | a | r) <br>
Display all terms classified as members of the
searchstr&rsquo;s domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-subsn Display substance
meronyms of searchstr (HAS SUBSTANCE relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-partn Display part meronyms of
searchstr (HAS PART relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-membn Display member meronyms
of searchstr (HAS MEMBER relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meron Display all meronyms of
searchstr (HAS PART, HAS MEMBER, HAS SUBSTANCE
relations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hmern Display meronyms for
searchstr tree. This is a recursive search that prints all
the meronyms of searchstr and all of its hypernyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sprtn Display part of holonyms
of searchstr (PART OF relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smemn Display member of
holonyms of searchstr (MEMBER OF relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ssubn Display substance of
holonyms of searchstr (SUBSTANCE OF relation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-holon Display all holonyms of
searchstr (PART OF, MEMBER OF, SUBSTANCE OF relations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hholn Display holonyms for
searchstr tree. This is a recursive search that prints all
the holonyms of searchstr and all of each holonym&rsquo;s
holonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-entav Display entailment
relations of searchstr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-framv Display applicable verb
sentence frames for searchstr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-causv Display cause to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH RESULTS <br>
The results of a search are written to the standard output.
For each search, the output consists a one line description
of the search, followed by the search results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All searches other than -over
list all senses matching the search results in the following
general format. Items enclosed in italicized square brackets
([ ... ]) may not be <br>
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One line listing the number of
senses matching the search request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each sense matching the search
requested displayed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sense n <br>
[{synset_offset}] [&lt;lex_filename&gt;]
word1[#sense_number][, word2...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where n is the sense number of
the search word, synset_offset is the byte offset of the
synset in the data.pos file corresponding to the syntactic
category, lex_filename <br>
is the name of the lexicographer file that the synset comes
from, word1 is the first word in the synset (note that this
is not necessarily the search word) and sense_num&acirc;
<br>
ber is the WordNet sense number assigned to the preceding
word. synset_offset, lex_filename, and sense_number are
generated when the -o, -a, and -s options, respectively,
<br>
are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The synsets matching the search
requested are printed below each sense&rsquo;s synset output
described above. Each line of output is preceded by a marker
(usually =&gt;), then a <br>
synset, formatted as described above. If a search traverses
more one level of the tree, then successive lines are
indented by spaces corresponding to its level in the <br>
hierarchy. When the -g option is specified, synset glosses
are displayed in parentheses at the end of each synset. Each
synset is printed on one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Senses are generally ordered
from most to least frequently used, with the most common
sense numbered 1. Frequency of use is determined by the
number of times a sense is <br>
tagged in the various semantic concordance texts. Senses
that are not semantically tagged follow the ordered senses.
Note that this ordering is only an estimate based on <br>
usage in a small corpus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verb senses can be grouped by
similarity of meaning, rather than ordered by frequency of
use. The -simsv search prints all senses that are close in
meaning together, with <br>
a line of dashes indicating the end of a group. See
wngroups(7) for a discussion of how senses are grouped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -over search displays an
overview of all the senses of the search word in all
syntactic categories. The results of this search are similar
to the -syns search, how&acirc; <br>
ever no additional (ex. hypernym) synsets are displayed, and
synset glosses are always printed. The senses are grouped by
syntactic category, and each synset is annotated <br>
as described above with synset_offset, lex_filename, and
sense_number as dictated by the -o, -a, and -s options. The
overview search also indicates how many of the senses <br>
in each syntactic category are represented in the tagged
texts. This is a way for the user to determine whether a
sense&rsquo;s sense number is based on semantic tagging
data, <br>
or was arbitrarily assigned. For each sense that has
appeared in such texts, the number of semantic tags to that
sense are indicated in parentheses after the sense
num&acirc; <br>
ber.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a search cannot be performed
on some senses of searchstr, the search results are headed
by a string of the form: <br>
X of Y senses of searchstr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the -deri search
shows word forms that are morphologically related to
searchstr. Each word form pointed to from searchstr is
displayed, preceded by RELATED <br>
TO-&gt; and the syntactic category of the link, followed, on
the next line, by its synset. Printed after the word form is
#n where n indicates the WordNet sense number of <br>
the term pointed to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -domn and -domt searches
show the domain that a synset has been classified in and,
conversely, all of the terms that have been assigned to a
specific domain. A domain <br>
is either a TOPIC, REGION or USAGE, as reflected in the
specific pointer character stored in the database, and
displayed in the output. A -domn search on a term shows the
<br>
domain, if any, that each synset containing searchstr has
been classified in. The output display shows the domain type
(TOPIC, REGION or USAGE), followed by the syntactic <br>
category of the domain synset and the terms in the synset.
Each term is followed by #n where n indicates the WordNet
sense number of the term. The converse search, <br>
-domt, shows all of the synsets that have been placed into
the domain searchstr, with analogous markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -framv is specified, sample
illustrative sentences and generic sentence frames are
displayed. If a sample sentence is found, the base form of
search is substituted <br>
into the sentence, and it is printed below the synset,
preceded with the EX: marker. When no sample sentences are
found, the generic sentence frames are displayed. Sen&acirc;
<br>
tence frames that are acceptable for all words in a synset
are preceded by the marker *&gt;. If a frame is acceptable
for the search word only, it is preceded by the marker <br>
=&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search results for adjectives
are slightly different from those for other parts of speech.
When an adjective is printed, its direct antonym, if it has
one, is also <br>
printed in parentheses. When searchstr is in a head synset,
all of the head synset&rsquo;s satellites are also
displayed. The position of an adjective in relation to the
noun <br>
may be restricted to the prenominal, postnominal or
predicative position. Where present, these restrictions are
noted in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an adjective is a
participle of a verb, the output indicates the verb and
displays its synset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an adverb is derived from
an adjective, the specific adjectival sense on which it is
based is indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The morphological
transformations performed by the search code may result in
more than one word to search for. WordNet automatically
performs the requested search on all <br>
of the strings and returns the results grouped by word. For
example, the verb saw is both the present tense of saw and
the past tense of see. When passed searchstr saw, <br>
WordNet performs the desired search first on saw and next on
see, returning the list of saw senses and search results,
followed by those for see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
wn() normally exits with the number of senses displayed. If
searchword is not found in WordNet, it exits with 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the WordNet database cannot
be opened, an error messages is displayed and wn() exits
with -1.</p>
