omshell - OMAPI Command Shell
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>omshell</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The OMAPI Command Shell, omshell, provides an interactive way to connect to,
  query, and possibly change, the ISC DHCP Server's state via OMAPI, the Object
  Management API. By using OMAPI and omshell, you do not have to stop, make
  changes, and then restart the DHCP server, but can make the changes while the
  server is running. Omshell provides a way of accessing OMAPI.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OMAPI is simply a communications mechanism that allows you to manipulate
  objects. In order to actually <i>use</i> omshell, you <i>must</i> understand
  what objects are available and how to use them. Documentation for OMAPI
  objects can be found in the documentation for the server that provides them -
  for example, in the <b>dhcpd(1)</b> manual page and the <b>dhclient(1)</b>
  manual page.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONTRIBUTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#CONTRIBUTIONS">CONTRIBUTIONS</a></h1>
This software is free software. At various times its development has been
  underwritten by various organizations, including the ISC and Vixie
  Enterprises. The development of 3.0 has been funded almost entirely by
  Nominum, Inc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At this point development is being shepherded by Ted Lemon, and hosted by the
  ISC, but the future of this project depends on you. If you have features you
  want, please consider implementing them.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOCAL_AND_REMOTE_OBJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#LOCAL_AND_REMOTE_OBJECTS">LOCAL
  AND REMOTE OBJECTS</a></h1>
Throughout this document, there are references to local and remote objects.
  Local objects are ones created in omshell with the <b>new</b> command. Remote
  objects are ones on the server: leases, hosts, and groups that the DHCP server
  knows about. Local and remote objects are associated together to enable
  viewing and modification of object attributes. Also, new remote objects can be
  created to match local objects.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPENING_A_CONNECTION"><a class="selflink" href="#OPENING_A_CONNECTION">OPENING
  A CONNECTION</a></h1>
omshell is started from the command line. Once omshell is started, there are
  several commands that can be issued:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>server <i>address</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">where address is the IP address of the DHCP
  server to connect to. If this is not specified, the default server is
  127.0.0.1 (localhost).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>port <i>number</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">where number is the port that OMAPI listens
  on. By default, this is 7911.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>key <i>name secret</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">This specifies the TSIG key to use to
  authenticate the OMAPI transactions. <i>name</i> is the name of a key defined
  in <i>dhcpd.conf</i> with the <b>omapi-key</b> statement. The <i>secret</i> is
  the secret key generated from <b>dnssec-keygen</b> or another key generation
  program.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>connect</b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">This starts the OMAPI connection to the server
  as specified by the <i>server</i> statement.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CREATING_LOCAL_OBJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CREATING_LOCAL_OBJECTS">CREATING
  LOCAL OBJECTS</a></h1>
Any object defined in OMAPI can be created, queried, and/or modified. The object
  types available to OMAPI are defined in <b>dhcpd(8)</b> and
  <b>dhclient(8)</b>. When using omshell, objects are first defined locally,
  manipulated as desired, and then associated with an object on the server. Only
  one object can be manipulated at a time. To create a local object, use
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>new <i>object-type</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;"><i>object-type</i> is one of group, host, or
  lease.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At this point, you now have an object that you can set properties on. For
  example, if a new lease object was created with <i>new lease</i>, any of a
  lease's attributes can be set as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>set <i>attribute-name = value</i></b>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;"><b>Attribute</b> names are defined in
  <b>dhcpd(8)</b> and <b>dhclient(8)</b>. Values should be quoted if they are
  strings. So, to set a lease's IP address, you would do the following: <b> set
  ip-address = 192.168.4.50</b></div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ASSOCIATING_LOCAL_AND_REMOTE_OBJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ASSOCIATING_LOCAL_AND_REMOTE_OBJECTS">ASSOCIATING
  LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS</a></h1>
At this point, you can query the server for information about this lease, by
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>open</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, the local lease object you created and set the IP address for is associated
  with the corresponding lease object on the DHCP server. All of the lease
  attributes from the DHCP server are now also the attributes on the local
  object, and will be shown in omshell.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VIEWING_A_REMOTE_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#VIEWING_A_REMOTE_OBJECT">VIEWING
  A REMOTE OBJECT</a></h1>
To query a lease of address 192.168.4.50, and find out its attributes, after
  connecting to the server, take the following steps:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>new lease</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This creates a new local lease object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>set ip-address = 192.168.4.50</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This sets the <i>local</i> object's IP address to be 192.168.4.50
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>open</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, if a lease with that IP address exists, you will see all the information
  the DHCP server has about that particular lease. Any data that isn't readily
  printable text will show up in colon-separated hexadecimal values. In this
  example, output back from the server for the entire transaction might look
  like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&gt; new &quot;lease&quot;
obj: lease
&gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.50
obj: lease
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
&gt; open
obj: lease
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
state = 00:00:00:02
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
client-hostname = &quot;wendelina&quot;
subnet = 00:00:00:06
pool = 00:00:00:07
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
tstp = 00:00:00:00
tsfp = 00:00:00:00
cltt = 00:00:00:00
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As you can see here, the IP address is represented in hexadecimal, as are the
  starting and ending times of the lease.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODIFYING_A_REMOTE_OBJECT"><a class="selflink" href="#MODIFYING_A_REMOTE_OBJECT">MODIFYING
  A REMOTE OBJECT</a></h1>
Attributes of remote objects are updated by using the <b>set</b> command as
  before, and then issuing an <b>update</b> command. The <b>set</b> command sets
  the attributes on the current local object, and the <b>update</b> command
  pushes those changes out to the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Continuing with the previous example, if a <b>set client-hostname =</b>
  <b>&quot;something-else&quot;</b> was issued, followed by an <b>update</b>
  command, the output would look about like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&gt; set client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
obj: lease
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
state = 00:00:00:02
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
subnet = 00:00:00:06
pool = 00:00:00:07
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
tstp = 00:00:00:00
tsfp = 00:00:00:00
cltt = 00:00:00:00
&gt; update
obj: lease
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
state = 00:00:00:02
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot;
subnet = 00:00:00:06
pool = 00:00:00:07
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
tstp = 00:00:00:00
tsfp = 00:00:00:00
cltt = 00:00:00:00
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NEW_REMOTE_OBJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#NEW_REMOTE_OBJECTS">NEW
  REMOTE OBJECTS</a></h1>
New remote objects are created much in the same way that existing server objects
  are modified. Create a local object using <b>new</b>, set the attributes as
  you'd wish them to be, and then create the remote object with the same
  properties by using
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>create</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now a new object exists on the DHCP server which matches the properties that you
  gave your local object. Objects created via OMAPI are saved into the
  dhcpd.leases file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if a new host with the IP address of 192.168.4.40 needs to be
  created it would be done as follows:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&gt; new host
obj: host
&gt; set name = &quot;some-host&quot;
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
&gt; set hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
&gt; set hardware-type = 1
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 1
&gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.40
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 1
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
&gt; create
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
&gt; 
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Your dhcpd.leases file would then have an entry like this in it:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
host some-host {
  dynamic;
  hardware ethernet 00:80:c7:84:b1:94;
  fixed-address 192.168.4.40;
}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>dynamic;</i> line is to denote that this host entry did not come from
  dhcpd.conf, but was created dynamically via OMAPI.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESETTING_ATTRIBUTES"><a class="selflink" href="#RESETTING_ATTRIBUTES">RESETTING
  ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
If you want to remove an attribute from an object, you can do this with the
  <b>unset</b> command. Once you have unset an attribute, you must use the
  <b>update</b> command to update the remote object. So, if the host
  &quot;some-host&quot; from the previous example will not have a static IP
  address anymore, the commands in omshell would look like this:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
&gt; unset ip-address
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ip-address = &lt;null&gt;
&gt; 
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REFRESHING_OBJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#REFRESHING_OBJECTS">REFRESHING
  OBJECTS</a></h1>
A local object may be refreshed with the current remote object properties using
  the <b>refresh</b> command. This is useful for object that change
  periodically, like leases, to see if they have been updated. This isn't
  particularly useful for hosts.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DELETING_OBJECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#DELETING_OBJECTS">DELETING
  OBJECTS</a></h1>
Any remote object that can be created can also be destroyed. This is done by
  creating a new local object, setting attributes, associating the local and
  remote object using <b>open</b>, and then using the <b>remove</b> command. If
  the host &quot;some-host&quot; from before was created in error, this could be
  corrected as follows:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
obj: host
name = &quot;some-host&quot;
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
&gt; remove
obj: &lt;null&gt;
&gt; 
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HELP"><a class="selflink" href="#HELP">HELP</a></h1>
The <b>help</b> command will print out all of the commands available in omshell,
  with some syntax pointers.
