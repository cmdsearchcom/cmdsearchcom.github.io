<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
omshell - OMAPI Command Shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
omshell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The OMAPI Command Shell, omshell, provides an interactive
way to connect to, query, and possibly change, the ISC DHCP
Server&rsquo;s state via OMAPI, the Object Management API.
By <br>
using OMAPI and omshell, you do not have to stop, make
changes, and then restart the DHCP server, but can make the
changes while the server is running. Omshell provides a way
of <br>
accessing OMAPI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OMAPI is simply a communications
mechanism that allows you to manipulate objects. In order to
actually use omshell, you must understand what objects are
available and how to use <br>
them. Documentation for OMAPI objects can be found in the
documentation for the server that provides them - for
example, in the dhcpd(1) manual page and the dhclient(1)
manual <br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTRIBUTIONS <br>
This software is free software. At various times its
development has been underwritten by various organizations,
including the ISC and Vixie Enterprises. The development of
3.0 <br>
has been funded almost entirely by Nominum, Inc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point development is
being shepherded by Ted Lemon, and hosted by the ISC, but
the future of this project depends on you. If you have
features you want, please consider <br>
implementing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL AND REMOTE OBJECTS <br>
Throughout this document, there are references to local and
remote objects. Local objects are ones created in omshell
with the new command. Remote objects are ones on the <br>
server: leases, hosts, and groups that the DHCP server knows
about. Local and remote objects are associated together to
enable viewing and modification of object attributes. <br>
Also, new remote objects can be created to match local
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPENING A CONNECTION <br>
omshell is started from the command line. Once omshell is
started, there are several commands that can be issued:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server address <br>
where address is the IP address of the DHCP server to
connect to. If this is not specified, the default server is
127.0.0.1 (localhost).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port number <br>
where number is the port that OMAPI listens on. By default,
this is 7911.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key name secret <br>
This specifies the TSIG key to use to authenticate the OMAPI
transactions. name is the name of a key defined in
dhcpd.conf with the omapi-key statement. The secret is the
<br>
secret key generated from dnssec-keygen or another key
generation program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect <br>
This starts the OMAPI connection to the server as specified
by the server statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING LOCAL OBJECTS <br>
Any object defined in OMAPI can be created, queried, and/or
modified. The object types available to OMAPI are defined in
dhcpd(8) and dhclient(8). When using omshell, objects <br>
are first defined locally, manipulated as desired, and then
associated with an object on the server. Only one object can
be manipulated at a time. To create a local object, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new object-type <br>
object-type is one of group, host, or lease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, you now have an
object that you can set properties on. For example, if a new
lease object was created with new lease, any of a
lease&rsquo;s attributes can be set as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set attribute-name = value <br>
Attribute names are defined in dhcpd(8) and dhclient(8).
Values should be quoted if they are strings. So, to set a
lease&rsquo;s IP address, you would do the following: <br>
set ip-address = 192.168.4.50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASSOCIATING LOCAL AND REMOTE
OBJECTS <br>
At this point, you can query the server for information
about this lease, by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, the local lease object you
created and set the IP address for is associated with the
corresponding lease object on the DHCP server. All of the
lease attributes from the <br>
DHCP server are now also the attributes on the local object,
and will be shown in omshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEWING A REMOTE OBJECT <br>
To query a lease of address 192.168.4.50, and find out its
attributes, after connecting to the server, take the
following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new lease</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This creates a new local lease
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set ip-address =
192.168.4.50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets the local
object&rsquo;s IP address to be 192.168.4.50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if a lease with that IP
address exists, you will see all the information the DHCP
server has about that particular lease. Any data that
isn&rsquo;t readily printable text will <br>
show up in colon-separated hexadecimal values. In this
example, output back from the server for the entire
transaction might look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; new &quot;lease&quot; <br>
obj: lease <br>
&gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.50 <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
&gt; open <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
state = 00:00:00:02 <br>
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
client-hostname = &quot;wendelina&quot; <br>
subnet = 00:00:00:06 <br>
pool = 00:00:00:07 <br>
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b <br>
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b <br>
tstp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
tsfp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
cltt = 00:00:00:00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you can see here, the IP
address is represented in hexadecimal, as are the starting
and ending times of the lease.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODIFYING A REMOTE OBJECT <br>
Attributes of remote objects are updated by using the set
command as before, and then issuing an update command. The
set command sets the attributes on the current local object,
<br>
and the update command pushes those changes out to the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continuing with the previous
example, if a set client-hostname =
&quot;something-else&quot; was issued, followed by an update
command, the output would look about like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set client-hostname =
&quot;something-else&quot; <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
state = 00:00:00:02 <br>
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; <br>
subnet = 00:00:00:06 <br>
pool = 00:00:00:07 <br>
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b <br>
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b <br>
tstp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
tsfp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
cltt = 00:00:00:00 <br>
&gt; update <br>
obj: lease <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:32 <br>
state = 00:00:00:02 <br>
dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
client-hostname = &quot;something-else&quot; <br>
subnet = 00:00:00:06 <br>
pool = 00:00:00:07 <br>
hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ends = dc:d9:0d:3b <br>
starts = 5c:9f:04:3b <br>
tstp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
tsfp = 00:00:00:00 <br>
cltt = 00:00:00:00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEW REMOTE OBJECTS <br>
New remote objects are created much in the same way that
existing server objects are modified. Create a local object
using new, set the attributes as you&rsquo;d wish them to
be, and <br>
then create the remote object with the same properties by
using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now a new object exists on the
DHCP server which matches the properties that you gave your
local object. Objects created via OMAPI are saved into the
dhcpd.leases file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if a new host with
the IP address of 192.168.4.40 needs to be created it would
be done as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; new host <br>
obj: host <br>
&gt; set name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
&gt; set hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
&gt; set hardware-type = 1 <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 1 <br>
&gt; set ip-address = 192.168.4.40 <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 1 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt; create <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your dhcpd.leases file would
then have an entry like this in it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host some-host { <br>
dynamic; <br>
hardware ethernet 00:80:c7:84:b1:94; <br>
fixed-address 192.168.4.40; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dynamic; line is to denote
that this host entry did not come from dhcpd.conf, but was
created dynamically via OMAPI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESETTING ATTRIBUTES <br>
If you want to remove an attribute from an object, you can
do this with the unset command. Once you have unset an
attribute, you must use the update command to update the
remote <br>
object. So, if the host &quot;some-host&quot; from the
previous example will not have a static IP address anymore,
the commands in omshell would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt; unset ip-address <br>
obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = &lt;null&gt; <br>
&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFRESHING OBJECTS <br>
A local object may be refreshed with the current remote
object properties using the refresh command. This is useful
for object that change periodically, like leases, to see if
<br>
they have been updated. This isn&rsquo;t particularly useful
for hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING OBJECTS <br>
Any remote object that can be created can also be destroyed.
This is done by creating a new local object, setting
attributes, associating the local and remote object using
open, <br>
and then using the remove command. If the host
&quot;some-host&quot; from before was created in error, this
could be corrected as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obj: host <br>
name = &quot;some-host&quot; <br>
hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94 <br>
hardware-type = 00:00:00:01 <br>
ip-address = c0:a8:04:28 <br>
&gt; remove <br>
obj: &lt;null&gt; <br>
&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HELP <br>
The help command will print out all of the commands
available in omshell, with some syntax pointers.</p>
