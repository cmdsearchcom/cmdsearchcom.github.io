<p>MAKEPP_SIGNATURES(1) Makepp MAKEPP_SIGNATURES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_signatures -- How makepp knows when files have
changed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
C: C, <br>
c_compilation_md5, M: &quot;md5&quot;, P: &quot;plain&quot;,
S: &quot;shared_object&quot;, X: &quot;xml&quot;, <br>
xml_space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file is associated with a
signature, which is a string that changes if the file has
changed. Makepp compares signatures to see whether it needs
to rebuild anything. The <br>
default signature for files is a concatenation of the
file&rsquo;s modification time and its size, unless
you&rsquo;re executing a C/C++ compilation command, in which
case the default <br>
signature is a cryptographic checksum on the file&rsquo;s
contents, ignoring comments and whitespace. If you want, you
can switch to a different method, or you can define your own
<br>
signature functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How the signature is actually
used is controlled by the build check method (see
makepp_build_check). Normally, if a file&rsquo;s signature
changes, the file itself is considered to <br>
have changed, and makepp forces a rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If makepp is building a file,
and you don&rsquo;t think it should be, you might want to
check the build log (see makepplog). Makepp writes an
explanation of what it thought each file <br>
depended on, and why it chose to rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several signature
methods included in makepp. Makepp usually picks the most
appropriate standard one automatically. However, you can
change the signature method for <br>
an individual rule by using &quot;:signature&quot; modifier
on the rule which depends on the files you want to check, or
for all rules in a makefile by using the
&quot;signature&quot; statement, or <br>
for all makefiles at once using the &quot;-m&quot; or
&quot;--signature-method&quot; command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mpp::Signature methods included
in the distribution <br>
plain (actually nameless) <br>
The plain signature method is the file&rsquo;s modification
time and the file&rsquo;s size, concatenated. These values
are quickly obtainable from the operating system and almost
always <br>
change when the file changes. For symlinks it uses the
values of the linkee. If there is no linkee, i.e. it&rsquo;s
a dangling symlink, then it uses its own values, but
prepends <br>
a 0 to mark the fact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp used to look only at the
file&rsquo;s modification time, but if you run makepp
several times within a second (e.g., in a script
that&rsquo;s building several small things), <br>
sometimes modification times won&rsquo;t change. Then,
hopefully the file&rsquo;s size will change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the case where you may run
makepp several times a second is a problem for you, you may
find that using the &quot;md5&quot; method is somewhat more
reliable. If makepp builds a <br>
file, it flushes its cached MD5 signatures even if the
file&rsquo;s date hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For efficiency&rsquo;s sake,
makepp won&rsquo;t reread the file and recompute the complex
signatures below if this plain signature hasn&rsquo;t
changed since the last time it computed it. <br>
This can theoretically cause a problem, since it&rsquo;s
possible to change the file&rsquo;s contents without
changing its date and size. In practice, this is quite hard
to do so it&rsquo;s <br>
not a serious danger. In the future, as more filesystems
switch to timestamps of under a second, hopefully Perl will
give us access to this info, making this failsafe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C <br>
c_compilation_md5 <br>
This is the method for input files to C like compilers. It
checks if a file&rsquo;s name looks like C or C++ source
code, including things like Corba IDL. If it does, this
method <br>
applies. If it doesn&rsquo;t, it falls back to plain
signatures for binary files (determined by name or else by
content) and else to &quot;md5&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea is to be independent of
formatting changes. This is done by pulling everything up as
far as possible, and by eliminating insignificant spaces.
Words are exempt <br>
from pulling up, since they might be macros containing
&quot;__LINE__&quot;, so they remain on the line where they
were.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// ignored comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef XYZ <br>
#include &lt;xyz.h&gt; <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int a = 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#line 20 <br>
void f <br>
( <br>
int b <br>
) <br>
{ <br>
a += b + ++c; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* more ignored comment */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is treated as though it were</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef XYZ <br>
#include&lt;xyz.h&gt; <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int a=1; <br>
#line 20 <br>
void f(</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int b){</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a+=b+ ++c;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That way you can reindent your
code or add or change comments without triggering a rebuild,
so long as you don&rsquo;t change the line numbers. (This
signature method recompiles <br>
if line numbers have changed because that causes calls to
&quot;__LINE__&quot; and most debugging information to
change.) It also ignores whitespace and comments after the
last token. <br>
This is useful for preventing a useless rebuild if your VC
adds lines at a &quot;$&quot;&quot;Log$&quot; tag when
checking in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is particularly
useful for the following situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You want to make
changes to the comments in a commonly included header file,
or you want to reformat or reindent part of it. For one
project that I worked on a long time <br>
ago, we were very unwilling to correct inaccurate comments
in a common header file, even when they were seriously
misleading, because doing so would trigger several hours
<br>
of rebuilds. With this signature method, this is no longer a
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You like to save
your files often, and your editor (unlike emacs) will
happily write a new copy out even if nothing has
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You have C/C++
source files which are generated automatically by other
build commands (e.g., yacc or some other preprocessor). For
one system I work with, we have a <br>
preprocessor which (like yacc) produces two output files, a
&quot;.cxx&quot; and a &quot;.h&quot; file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.h %.cxx: %.qtdlg
$(HLIB)/Qt/qt_dialog_generator <br>
$(HLIB)/Qt/qt_dialog_generator $(input)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every time the input file
changed, the resulting .h file also was rewritten, and
ordinarily this would trigger a rebuild of everything that
included it. However, most of <br>
the time the contents of the .h file didn&rsquo;t actually
change (except for a comment about the build time written by
the preprocessor), so a recompilation was not actually <br>
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually in practice this saves
less recompiles than you&rsquo;d hope for, because mere
comment changes often add lines. In order for logging with
&quot;__LINE__&quot; or the debugger to <br>
match your source, this requires recompilation. So this
signature is specially useless for the &quot;tangle&quot;
family of tools from literate programming, where your code
resides in <br>
some bigger file and even changes to a documentation section
irrelevant to code will be reflected in the extracted source
via a &quot;#line&quot; directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you can live with wrong line
numbers during development, you can set the variable
&quot;makepp_signature_C_flat&quot; (with an uppercase C) to
some true value (like 1). Then, <br>
whereas the compiler still sees the real file, the above
example will be flattened for signing as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef XYZ <br>
#include&lt;xyz.h&gt; <br>
#endif <br>
int a=1;void f(int b){a+=b+ ++c;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that signatures are only
recalculated when files change. So you can build for
everyone in a repository without this option, and those who
want the option can set it <br>
when building in their sandbox. When they first locally
change a file, even only trivially, that will cause a
recompilation, because with this option a totally different
<br>
signature is calculated. But then they can reformat the file
as much as they want without further recompilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The opposite is also true: Just
omitting this option after it was set and recompiling will
not fix your line numbers. So, if line numbers matter,
don&rsquo;t do a production build <br>
in the same sandbox without cleaning first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">md5 This is the default method,
for files not recognized by the &quot;C&quot; method.
Computes an MD5 checksum of the file&rsquo;s contents,
rather than looking at the file&rsquo;s date or size. <br>
This means that if you change the date on the file but
don&rsquo;t change its contents, makepp won&rsquo;t try to
rebuild anything that depends on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is particularly useful if
you have some file which is often regenerated during the
build process that other files depend on, but which usually
doesn&rsquo;t actually change. <br>
If you use the &quot;md5&quot; signature checking method,
makepp will realize that the file&rsquo;s contents
haven&rsquo;t changed even if the file&rsquo;s date has
changed. (Of course, this won&rsquo;t help <br>
if the files have a timestamp written inside of them, as
archive files do for example.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shared_object <br>
This method only works if you have the utility
&quot;nm&quot; in your path, and it accepts the
&quot;-P&quot; option to output Posix format. In that case
only the names and types of symbols in <br>
dynamically loaded libraries become part of their signature.
The result is that you can change the coding of functions
without having to relink the programs that use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following command the
parser will detect an implicit dependency on
$(LIBDIR)/libmylib.so, and build it if necessary. However
the link command will only be reperformed <br>
whenever the library exports a different set of symbols:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">myprog: $(OBJECTS) :signature
shared_object <br>
$(LD) -L$(LIBDIR) -lmylib $(inputs) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This works as long as the
functions&rsquo; interfaces don&rsquo;t change. But in that
case you&rsquo;d change the declaration, so you&rsquo;d also
need to change the callers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this method only
applies to files whose name looks like a shared library. For
all other files it falls back to
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot;, which may in turn fall back
to <br>
others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xml <br>
xml_space <br>
These are two similar methods which treat xml canonically
and differ only in their handling of whitespace. The first
completely ignores it around tags and considers it like <br>
a single space elsewhere, making the signature immune to
formatting changes. The second respects any whitespace in
the xml, which is necessary even if just a small part <br>
requires that, like a &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot; section in an
xhtml document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common to both methods is that
they sign the essence of each xml document. Presence or not
of a BOM or &quot;&lt;?xml?&gt;&quot; header is ignored.
Comments are ignored, as is whether text <br>
is protected as &quot;CDATA&quot; or with entities. Order
and quoting style of attributes doesn&rsquo;t matter, nor
does how you render empty tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For any file which is not valid
xml, or if the Expat based &quot;XML::Parser&quot; or the
&quot;XML::LibXML&quot; parser is not installed, this falls
back to method md5. If you switch your Perl <br>
installation from one of the parsers to the others, makepp
will think the files are different as soon as their
timestamp changes. This is because the result of either
parser <br>
is logically equivalent, but they produce different
signatures. In the unlikely case that this is a problem, you
can force use of only &quot;XML::LibXML&quot; by setting in
Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Mpp::Signature::xml::libxml =
1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extending applicability <br>
The &quot;C&quot; or &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; method
has a built in list of suffixes it recognizes as being C or
C-like. If it gets applied to other files it falls back to
simpler signature <br>
methods. But many file types are syntactically close enough
to C++ for this method to be useful. Close enough means C++
comment and string syntax and whitespace is meaningless <br>
except one space between words (and C++&rsquo;s problem
cases &quot;- -&quot;, &quot;+ +&quot;, &quot;/ *&quot; and
&quot;&lt; &lt;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It (and its subclasses) can now
easily be extended to other suffixes. Anyplace you can
specify a signature you can now tack on one one of these
syntaxes to make the method <br>
accept additional filenames:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C.suffix1,suffix2,suffix3 <br>
One or more comma-separated suffixes can be added to the
method by a colon. For example &quot;C.ipp,tpp&quot; means
that besides the built in suffixes it will also apply to
files <br>
ending in .ipp or .tpp, which you might be using for the
inline and template part of C++ headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C.(suffix-regexp) <br>
This is like the previous, but instead of enumerating
suffixes, you give a Perl regular expression to match the
ones you want. The previous example would be
&quot;C.(ipp|tpp)&quot; or <br>
&quot;C.([it]pp)&quot; in this syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C(regexp) <br>
Without a dot the Perl regular expression can match anywhere
in the file name. If it includes a slash, it will be tried
against the fully qualified filename, otherwise only <br>
against the last part, without any directory. So if you have
C++ style suffixless headers in a directory include, use
&quot;C(include/)&quot; as your signature method. However
the <br>
above suffix example would be quite nasty this way,
&quot;C(.(?:ipp|tpp)$$)&quot; or &quot;C(.[it]pp$$)&quot;
because &quot;$&quot; is the expansion character in
makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shortcomings <br>
Signature methods apply to all files of a rule. Now if you
have a compiler that takes a C like source code and an XML
configuration file you&rsquo;d either need a combined
signature <br>
method that smartly handles both file types, or you must
choose an existing method which will not know whether a
change in the other file is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the future signature method
configuration may be changed to filename-pattern, optionally
per command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom methods <br>
You can, if you want, define your own methods for
calculating file signatures and comparing them. You will
need to write a Perl module to do this. Have a look at the
comments <br>
in &quot;Mpp/Signature.pm&quot; in the distribution, and
also at the existing signature algorithms in
&quot;Mpp/Signature/*.pm&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some cases where you
might want a custom signature method:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When you want
all changes in a file to be ignored. Say you always want
dateStamp.o to be a dependency (to force a rebuild), but you
don&rsquo;t want to rebuild if only dateStamp.o <br>
has changed. You could define a signature method that
inherits from &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; that recognizes
the dateStamp.o file by its name, and always returns a
constant value <br>
for that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When you want to
ignore part of a file. Suppose that you have a program that
generates a file that has a date stamp in it, but you
don&rsquo;t want to recompile if only the date <br>
stamp has changed. Just define a signature method similar to
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; that understands your file
format and skips the parts you don&rsquo;t want to take into
account.</p>
