Each file is associated with a <i>signature</i>, which is a string that changes
  if the file has changed. Makepp compares signatures to see whether it needs to
  rebuild anything. The default signature for files is a concatenation of the
  file's modification time and its size, unless you're executing a C/C++
  compilation command, in which case the default signature is a cryptographic
  checksum on the file's contents, ignoring comments and whitespace. If you
  want, you can switch to a different method, or you can define your own
  signature functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
How the signature is actually used is controlled by the <i>build check
  method</i> (see makepp_build_check). Normally, if a file's signature changes,
  the file itself is considered to have changed, and makepp forces a rebuild.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If makepp is building a file, and you don't think it should be, you might want
  to check the build log (see makepplog). Makepp writes an explanation of what
  it thought each file depended on, and why it chose to rebuild.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several signature methods included in makepp. Makepp usually picks the
  most appropriate standard one automatically. However, you can change the
  signature method for an individual rule by using &quot;:signature&quot;
  modifier on the rule which depends on the files you want to check, or for all
  rules in a makefile by using the &quot;signature&quot; statement, or for all
  makefiles at once using the &quot;-m&quot; or &quot;--signature-method&quot;
  command line option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Mpp::Signature_methods_included_in_the_distribution"><a class="selflink" href="#Mpp::Signature_methods_included_in_the_distribution">Mpp::Signature

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">plain (actually nameless)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The plain signature method is the file's modification time
      and the file's size, concatenated. These values are quickly obtainable
      from the operating system and almost always change when the file changes.
      For symlinks it uses the values of the linkee. If there is no linkee, i.e.
      it's a dangling symlink, then it uses its own values, but prepends a 0 to
      mark the fact.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Makepp used to look only at the file's modification time, but if you run
      makepp several times within a second (e.g., in a script that's building
      several small things), sometimes modification times won't change. Then,
      hopefully the file's size will change.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the case where you may run makepp several times a second is a problem for
      you, you may find that using the &quot;md5&quot; method is somewhat more
      reliable. If makepp builds a file, it flushes its cached MD5 signatures
      even if the file's date hasn't changed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For efficiency's sake, makepp won't reread the file and recompute the
      complex signatures below if this plain signature hasn't changed since the
      last time it computed it. This can theoretically cause a problem, since
      it's possible to change the file's contents without changing its date and
      size. In practice, this is quite hard to do so it's not a serious danger.
      In the future, as more filesystems switch to timestamps of under a second,
      hopefully Perl will give us access to this info, making this
    failsafe.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">c_compilation_md5</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the method for input files to C like compilers. It
      checks if a file's name looks like C or C++ source code, including things
      like Corba IDL. If it does, this method applies. If it doesn't, it falls
      back to plain signatures for binary files (determined by name or else by
      content) and else to &quot;md5&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The idea is to be independent of formatting changes. This is done by pulling
      everything up as far as possible, and by eliminating insignificant spaces.
      Words are exempt from pulling up, since they might be macros containing
      &quot;__LINE__&quot;, so they remain on the line where they were.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    // ignored comment
  
    #ifdef XYZ
        #include &lt;xyz.h&gt;
    #endif
  
    int a = 1;
  
    #line 20
    void f
    (
        int b
    )
    {
        a += b + ++c;
    }
  
        /* more ignored comment */
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    is treated as though it were
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    #ifdef XYZ
    #include&lt;xyz.h&gt;
    #endif

    #line 20
    void f(

    a+=b+ ++c;}
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    That way you can reindent your code or add or change comments without
      triggering a rebuild, so long as you don't change the line numbers. (This
      signature method recompiles if line numbers have changed because that
      causes calls to &quot;__LINE__&quot; and most debugging information to
      change.) It also ignores whitespace and comments <b>after</b> the last
      token. This is useful for preventing a useless rebuild if your VC adds
      lines at a &quot;$&quot;&quot;Log$&quot; tag when checking in.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This method is particularly useful for the following situations:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You want to make changes to the comments in a commonly
      included header file, or you want to reformat or reindent part of it. For
      one project that I worked on a long time ago, we were very unwilling to
      correct inaccurate comments in a common header file, even when they were
      seriously misleading, because doing so would trigger several hours of
      rebuilds. With this signature method, this is no longer a problem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You like to save your files often, and your editor (unlike
      emacs) will happily write a new copy out even if nothing has changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You have C/C++ source files which are generated
      automatically by other build commands (e.g., yacc or some other
      preprocessor). For one system I work with, we have a preprocessor which
      (like yacc) produces two output files, a &quot;.cxx&quot; and a
      &quot;.h&quot; file:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    %.h %.cxx: %.qtdlg $(HLIB)/Qt/qt_dialog_generator
        $(HLIB)/Qt/qt_dialog_generator $(input)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Every time the input file changed, the resulting <i>.h</i> file also was
      rewritten, and ordinarily this would trigger a rebuild of everything that
      included it. However, most of the time the contents of the <i>.h</i> file
      didn't actually change (except for a comment about the build time written
      by the preprocessor), so a recompilation was not actually necessary.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Actually in practice this saves less recompiles than you'd hope for, because
  mere comment changes often add lines. In order for logging with
  &quot;__LINE__&quot; or the debugger to match your source, this requires
  recompilation. So this signature is specially useless for the
  &quot;tangle&quot; family of tools from literate programming, where your code
  resides in some bigger file and even changes to a documentation section
  irrelevant to code will be reflected in the extracted source via a
  &quot;#line&quot; directive.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you can live with wrong line numbers during development, you can set the
  variable &quot;makepp_signature_C_flat&quot; (with an uppercase C) to some
  true value (like 1). Then, whereas the compiler still sees the real file, the
  above example will be flattened for signing as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    #ifdef XYZ
    #include&lt;xyz.h&gt;
    #endif
    int a=1;void f(int b){a+=b+ ++c;}
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that signatures are only recalculated when files change. So you can build
  for everyone in a repository without this option, and those who want the
  option can set it when building in their sandbox. When they first locally
  change a file, even only trivially, that will cause a recompilation, because
  with this option a totally different signature is calculated. But then they
  can reformat the file as much as they want without further recompilation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The opposite is also true: Just omitting this option after it was set and
  recompiling will not fix your line numbers. So, if line numbers matter, don't
  do a production build in the same sandbox without cleaning first.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">md5</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the default method, for files not recognized by the
      &quot;C&quot; method. Computes an MD5 checksum of the file's contents,
      rather than looking at the file's date or size. This means that if you
      change the date on the file but don't change its contents, makepp won't
      try to rebuild anything that depends on it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is particularly useful if you have some file which is often regenerated
      during the build process that other files depend on, but which usually
      doesn't actually change. If you use the &quot;md5&quot; signature checking
      method, makepp will realize that the file's contents haven't changed even
      if the file's date has changed. (Of course, this won't help if the files
      have a timestamp written inside of them, as archive files do for
    example.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">shared_object</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This method only works if you have the utility
      &quot;nm&quot; in your path, and it accepts the &quot;-P&quot; option to
      output Posix format. In that case only the names and types of symbols in
      dynamically loaded libraries become part of their signature. The result is
      that you can change the coding of functions without having to relink the
      programs that use them.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In the following command the parser will detect an implicit dependency on
      <i>$(LIBDIR)/libmylib.so</i>, and build it if necessary. However the link
      command will only be reperformed whenever the library exports a different
      set of symbols:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    myprog: $(OBJECTS) :signature shared_object
        $(LD) -L$(LIBDIR) -lmylib $(inputs) -o $(output)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This works as long as the functions' interfaces don't change. But in that
      case you'd change the declaration, so you'd also need to change the
      callers.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that this method only applies to files whose name looks like a shared
      library. For all other files it falls back to
      &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot;, which may in turn fall back to others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">xml</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">xml_space</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are two similar methods which treat xml canonically
      and differ only in their handling of whitespace. The first completely
      ignores it around tags and considers it like a single space elsewhere,
      making the signature immune to formatting changes. The second respects any
      whitespace in the xml, which is necessary even if just a small part
      requires that, like a &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot; section in an xhtml
      document.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Common to both methods is that they sign the essence of each xml document.
      Presence or not of a BOM or &quot;&lt;?xml?&gt;&quot; header is ignored.
      Comments are ignored, as is whether text is protected as &quot;CDATA&quot;
      or with entities. Order and quoting style of attributes doesn't matter,
      nor does how you render empty tags.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For any file which is not valid xml, or if the Expat based
      &quot;XML::Parser&quot; or the &quot;XML::LibXML&quot; parser is not
      installed, this falls back to method md5. If you switch your Perl
      installation from one of the parsers to the others, makepp will think the
      files are different as soon as their timestamp changes. This is because
      the result of either parser is logically equivalent, but they produce
      different signatures. In the unlikely case that this is a problem, you can
      force use of only &quot;XML::LibXML&quot; by setting in Perl:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $Mpp::Signature::xml::libxml = 1;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extending_applicability"><a class="selflink" href="#Extending_applicability">Extending
  applicability</a></h2>
The &quot;C&quot; or &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; method has a built in list of
  suffixes it recognizes as being C or C-like. If it gets applied to other files
  it falls back to simpler signature methods. But many file types are
  syntactically close enough to C++ for this method to be useful. Close enough
  means C++ comment and string syntax and whitespace is meaningless except one
  space between words (and C++'s problem cases &quot;- -&quot;, &quot;+ +&quot;,
  &quot;/ *&quot; and &quot;&lt; &lt;&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It (and its subclasses) can now easily be extended to other suffixes. Anyplace
  you can specify a signature you can now tack on one one of these syntaxes to
  make the method accept additional filenames:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">C.<i>suffix1,suffix2,suffix3</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">One or more comma-separated suffixes can be added to the
      method by a colon. For example &quot;C.ipp,tpp&quot; means that besides
      the built in suffixes it will also apply to files ending in <i>.ipp</i> or
      <i>.tpp</i>, which you might be using for the inline and template part of
      C++ headers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">C.(<i>suffix-regexp</i>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is like the previous, but instead of enumerating
      suffixes, you give a Perl regular expression to match the ones you want.
      The previous example would be &quot;C.(ipp|tpp)&quot; or
      &quot;C.([it]pp)&quot; in this syntax.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">C(<i>regexp</i>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Without a dot the Perl regular expression can match
      anywhere in the file name. If it includes a slash, it will be tried
      against the fully qualified filename, otherwise only against the last
      part, without any directory. So if you have C++ style suffixless headers
      in a directory <i>include</i>, use &quot;C(include/)&quot; as your
      signature method. However the above suffix example would be quite nasty
      this way, &quot;C(\.(?:ipp|tpp)$$)&quot; or &quot;C(\.[it]pp$$)&quot;
      because &quot;$&quot; is the expansion character in makefiles.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Shortcomings"><a class="selflink" href="#Shortcomings">Shortcomings</a></h2>
Signature methods apply to all files of a rule. Now if you have a compiler that
  takes a C like source code and an XML configuration file you'd either need a
  combined signature method that smartly handles both file types, or you must
  choose an existing method which will not know whether a change in the other
  file is significant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the future signature method configuration may be changed to filename-pattern,
  optionally per command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Custom_methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Custom_methods">Custom
  methods</a></h2>
You can, if you want, define your own methods for calculating file signatures
  and comparing them. You will need to write a Perl module to do this. Have a
  look at the comments in &quot;Mpp/Signature.pm&quot; in the distribution, and
  also at the existing signature algorithms in &quot;Mpp/Signature/*.pm&quot;
  for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some cases where you might want a custom signature method:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When you want all changes in a file to be ignored. Say you
      always want <i>dateStamp.o</i> to be a dependency (to force a rebuild),
      but you don't want to rebuild if only <i>dateStamp.o</i> has changed. You
      could define a signature method that inherits from
      &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; that recognizes the <i>dateStamp.o</i> file
      by its name, and always returns a constant value for that file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When you want to ignore part of a file. Suppose that you
      have a program that generates a file that has a date stamp in it, but you
      don't want to recompile if only the date stamp has changed. Just define a
      signature method similar to &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; that understands
      your file format and skips the parts you don't want to take into
    account.</dd>
