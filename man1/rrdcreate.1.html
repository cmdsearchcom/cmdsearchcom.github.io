<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rrdcreate - Set up a new Round Robin Database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rrdtool create filename [--start|-b start time] [--step|-s
step] [--no-overwrite] [DS:ds-name:DST:dst arguments]
[RRA:CF:cf arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The create function of RRDtool lets you set up new Round
Robin Database (RRD) files. The file is created at its
final, full size and filled with *UNKNOWN* data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
The name of the RRD you want to create. RRD files should end
with the extension .rrd. However, RRDtool will accept any
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start|-b start time (default:
now - 10s) <br>
Specifies the time in seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC when the
first value should be added to the RRD. RRDtool will not
accept any data timed before or at the time specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also AT-STYLE TIME
SPECIFICATION section in the rrdfetch documentation for
other ways to specify time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--step|-s step (default: 300
seconds) <br>
Specifies the base interval in seconds with which data will
be fed into the RRD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-overwrite <br>
Do not clobber an existing file of the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS:ds-name:DST:dst arguments
<br>
A single RRD can accept input from several data sources
(DS), for example incoming and outgoing traffic on a
specific communication line. With the DS configuration
option you <br>
must define some basic properties of each data source you
want to store in the RRD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ds-name is the name you will use
to reference this particular data source from an RRD. A
ds-name must be 1 to 19 characters long in the characters
[a-zA-Z0-9_].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DST defines the Data Source
Type. The remaining arguments of a data source entry depend
on the data source type. For GAUGE, COUNTER, DERIVE, and
ABSOLUTE the format for a data <br>
source entry is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS:ds-name:GAUGE | COUNTER |
DERIVE | ABSOLUTE:heartbeat:min:max</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For COMPUTE data sources, the
format is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS:ds-name:COMPUTE:rpn-expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to decide which data
source type to use, review the definitions that follow. Also
consult the section on &quot;HOW TO MEASURE&quot; for
further insight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GAUGE <br>
is for things like temperatures or number of people in a
room or the value of a RedHat share.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COUNTER <br>
is for continuous incrementing counters like the ifInOctets
counter in a router. The COUNTER data source assumes that
the counter never decreases, except when a counter <br>
overflows. The update function takes the overflow into
account. The counter is stored as a per-second rate. When
the counter overflows, RRDtool checks if the overflow <br>
happened at the 32bit or 64bit border and acts accordingly
by adding an appropriate value to the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DERIVE <br>
will store the derivative of the line going from the last to
the current value of the data source. This can be useful for
gauges, for example, to measure the rate of people <br>
entering or leaving a room. Internally, derive works exactly
like COUNTER but without overflow checks. So if your counter
does not reset at 32 or 64 bit you might want to use <br>
DERIVE and combine it with a MIN value of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE on COUNTER vs DERIVE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">by Don Baarda
&lt;don.baarda@baesystems.com&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you cannot tolerate ever
mistaking the occasional counter reset for a legitimate
counter wrap, and would prefer &quot;Unknowns&quot; for all
legitimate counter wraps and resets, <br>
always use DERIVE with min=0. Otherwise, using COUNTER with
a suitable max will return correct values for all legitimate
counter wraps, mark some counter resets as
&quot;Unknown&quot;, <br>
but can mistake some counter resets for a legitimate counter
wrap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a 5 minute step and 32-bit
counter, the probability of mistaking a counter reset for a
legitimate wrap is arguably about 0.8% per 1Mbps of maximum
bandwidth. Note that <br>
this equates to 80% for 100Mbps interfaces, so for high
bandwidth interfaces and a 32bit counter, DERIVE with min=0
is probably preferable. If you are using a 64bit counter,
<br>
just about any max setting will eliminate the possibility of
mistaking a reset for a counter wrap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABSOLUTE <br>
is for counters which get reset upon reading. This is used
for fast counters which tend to overflow. So instead of
reading them normally you reset them after every read to
<br>
make sure you have a maximum time available before the next
overflow. Another usage is for things you count like number
of messages since the last update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPUTE <br>
is for storing the result of a formula applied to other data
sources in the RRD. This data source is not supplied a value
on update, but rather its Primary Data Points (PDPs) <br>
are computed from the PDPs of the data sources according to
the rpn-expression that defines the formula. Consolidation
functions are then applied normally to the PDPs of the <br>
COMPUTE data source (that is the rpn-expression is only
applied to generate PDPs). In database software, such data
sets are referred to as &quot;virtual&quot; or
&quot;computed&quot; columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">heartbeat defines the maximum
number of seconds that may pass between two updates of this
data source before the value of the data source is assumed
to be *UNKNOWN*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min and max define the expected
range values for data supplied by a data source. If min
and/or max are specified any value outside the defined range
will be regarded as <br>
*UNKNOWN*. If you do not know or care about min and max, set
them to U for unknown. Note that min and max always refer to
the processed values of the DS. For a traffic-COUNTER <br>
type DS this would be the maximum and minimum data-rate
expected from the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If information on
minimal/maximal expected values is available, always set the
min and/or max properties. This will help RRDtool in doing a
simple sanity check on the data <br>
supplied when running update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpn-expression defines the
formula used to compute the PDPs of a COMPUTE data source
from other data sources in the same &lt;RRD&gt;. It is
similar to defining a CDEF argument for the <br>
graph command. Please refer to that manual page for a list
and description of RPN operations supported. For COMPUTE
data sources, the following RPN operations are not
supported: <br>
COUNT, PREV, TIME, and LTIME. In addition, in defining the
RPN expression, the COMPUTE data source may only refer to
the names of data source listed previously in the create
<br>
command. This is similar to the restriction that CDEFs must
refer only to DEFs and CDEFs previously defined in the same
graph command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRA:CF:cf arguments <br>
The purpose of an RRD is to store data in the round robin
archives (RRA). An archive consists of a number of data
values or statistics for each of the defined data-sources
(DS) <br>
and is defined with an RRA line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When data is entered into an
RRD, it is first fit into time slots of the length defined
with the -s option, thus becoming a primary data point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data is also processed with
the consolidation function (CF) of the archive. There are
several consolidation functions that consolidate primary
data points via an aggregate <br>
function: AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, LAST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVERAGE <br>
the average of the data points is stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIN the smallest of the data
points is stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAX the largest of the data
points is stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAST <br>
the last data points is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that data aggregation
inevitably leads to loss of precision and information. The
trick is to pick the aggregate function such that the
interesting properties of your data is <br>
kept across the aggregation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of RRA line for these
consolidation functions is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRA:AVERAGE | MIN | MAX |
LAST:xff:steps:rows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xff The xfiles factor defines
what part of a consolidation interval may be made up from
*UNKNOWN* data while the consolidated value is still
regarded as known. It is given as the <br>
ratio of allowed *UNKNOWN* PDPs to the number of PDPs in the
interval. Thus, it ranges from 0 to 1 (exclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">steps defines how many of these
primary data points are used to build a consolidated data
point which then goes into the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rows defines how many
generations of data values are kept in an RRA. Obviously,
this has to be greater than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aberrant Behavior Detection with
Holt-Winters Forecasting <br>
In addition to the aggregate functions, there are a set of
specialized functions that enable RRDtool to provide data
smoothing (via the Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm), <br>
confidence bands, and the flagging aberrant behavior in the
data source time series:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
RRA:HWPREDICT:rows:alpha:beta:seasonal period[:rra-num]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
RRA:MHWPREDICT:rows:alpha:beta:seasonal period[:rra-num]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
RRA:SEASONAL:seasonal
period:gamma:rra-num[:smoothing-window=fraction]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
RRA:DEVSEASONAL:seasonal
period:gamma:rra-num[:smoothing-window=fraction]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
RRA:DEVPREDICT:rows:rra-num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
RRA:FAILURES:rows:threshold:window length:rra-num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These RRAs differ from the true
consolidation functions in several ways. First, each of the
RRAs is updated once for every primary data point. Second,
these RRAs are <br>
interdependent. To generate real-time confidence bounds, a
matched set of SEASONAL, DEVSEASONAL, DEVPREDICT, and either
HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT must exist. Generating smoothed <br>
values of the primary data points requires a SEASONAL RRA
and either an HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT RRA. Aberrant behavior
detection requires FAILURES, DEVSEASONAL, SEASONAL, and <br>
either HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The predicted, or smoothed,
values are stored in the HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT RRA.
HWPREDICT and MHWPREDICT are actually two variations on the
Holt-Winters method. They are <br>
interchangeable. Both attempt to decompose data into three
components: a baseline, a trend, and a seasonal coefficient.
HWPREDICT adds its seasonal coefficient to the baseline <br>
to form a prediction, whereas MHWPREDICT multiplies its
seasonal coefficient by the baseline to form a prediction.
The difference is noticeable when the baseline changes <br>
significantly in the course of a season; HWPREDICT will
predict the seasonality to stay constant as the baseline
changes, but MHWPREDICT will predict the seasonality to grow
or <br>
shrink in proportion to the baseline. The proper choice of
method depends on the thing being modeled. For simplicity,
the rest of this discussion will refer to HWPREDICT, but
<br>
MHWPREDICT may be substituted in its place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The predicted deviations are
stored in DEVPREDICT (think a standard deviation which can
be scaled to yield a confidence band). The FAILURES RRA
stores binary indicators. A 1 <br>
marks the indexed observation as failure; that is, the
number of confidence bounds violations in the preceding
window of observations met or exceeded a specified
threshold. An <br>
example of using these RRAs to graph confidence bounds and
failures appears in rrdgraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL
RRAs store the seasonal coefficients for the Holt-Winters
forecasting algorithm and the seasonal deviations,
respectively. There is one entry per <br>
observation time point in the seasonal cycle. For example,
if primary data points are generated every five minutes and
the seasonal cycle is 1 day, both SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL
<br>
will have 288 rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to simplify the
creation for the novice user, in addition to supporting
explicit creation of the HWPREDICT, SEASONAL, DEVPREDICT,
DEVSEASONAL, and FAILURES RRAs, the <br>
RRDtool create command supports implicit creation of the
other four when HWPREDICT is specified alone and the final
argument rra-num is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rows specifies the length of the
RRA prior to wrap around. Remember that there is a
one-to-one correspondence between primary data points and
entries in these RRAs. For the <br>
HWPREDICT CF, rows should be larger than the seasonal
period. If the DEVPREDICT RRA is implicitly created, the
default number of rows is the same as the HWPREDICT rows
argument. <br>
If the FAILURES RRA is implicitly created, rows will be set
to the seasonal period argument of the HWPREDICT RRA. Of
course, the RRDtool resize command is available if these
<br>
defaults are not sufficient and the creator wishes to avoid
explicit creations of the other specialized function
RRAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seasonal period specifies the
number of primary data points in a seasonal cycle. If
SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL are implicitly created, this
argument for those RRAs is set <br>
automatically to the value specified by HWPREDICT. If they
are explicitly created, the creator should verify that all
three seasonal period arguments agree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alpha is the adaption parameter
of the intercept (or baseline) coefficient in the
Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm. See rrdtool for a
description of this algorithm. alpha must <br>
lie between 0 and 1. A value closer to 1 means that more
recent observations carry greater weight in predicting the
baseline component of the forecast. A value closer to 0
means <br>
that past history carries greater weight in predicting the
baseline component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beta is the adaption parameter
of the slope (or linear trend) coefficient in the
Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm. beta must lie between 0
and 1 and plays the same role as <br>
alpha with respect to the predicted linear trend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gamma is the adaption parameter
of the seasonal coefficients in the Holt-Winters forecasting
algorithm (HWPREDICT) or the adaption parameter in the
exponential smoothing update <br>
of the seasonal deviations. It must lie between 0 and 1. If
the SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL RRAs are created implicitly,
they will both have the same value for gamma: the value <br>
specified for the HWPREDICT alpha argument. Note that
because there is one seasonal coefficient (or deviation) for
each time point during the seasonal cycle, the adaptation
rate <br>
is much slower than the baseline. Each seasonal coefficient
is only updated (or adapts) when the observed value occurs
at the offset in the seasonal cycle corresponding to that
<br>
coefficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL RRAs
are created explicitly, gamma need not be the same for both.
Note that gamma can also be changed via the RRDtool tune
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smoothing-window specifies the
fraction of a season that should be averaged around each
point. By default, the value of smoothing-window is 0.05,
which means each value in <br>
SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL will be occasionally replaced by
averaging it with its (seasonal period*0.05) nearest
neighbors. Setting smoothing-window to zero will disable the
<br>
running-average smoother altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rra-num provides the links
between related RRAs. If HWPREDICT is specified alone and
the other RRAs are created implicitly, then there is no need
to worry about this argument. If <br>
RRAs are created explicitly, then carefully pay attention to
this argument. For each RRA which includes this argument,
there is a dependency between that RRA and another RRA. The
<br>
rra-num argument is the 1-based index in the order of RRA
creation (that is, the order they appear in the create
command). The dependent RRA for each RRA requiring the
rra-num <br>
argument is listed here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; HWPREDICT
rra-num is the index of the SEASONAL RRA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SEASONAL rra-num
is the index of the HWPREDICT RRA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DEVPREDICT
rra-num is the index of the DEVSEASONAL RRA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DEVSEASONAL
rra-num is the index of the HWPREDICT RRA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; FAILURES rra-num
is the index of the DEVSEASONAL RRA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threshold is the minimum number
of violations (observed values outside the confidence
bounds) within a window that constitutes a failure. If the
FAILURES RRA is implicitly <br>
created, the default value is 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window length is the number of
time points in the window. Specify an integer greater than
or equal to the threshold and less than or equal to 28. The
time interval this window <br>
represents depends on the interval between primary data
points. If the FAILURES RRA is implicitly created, the
default value is 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HEARTBEAT and the STEP <br>
Here is an explanation by Don Baarda on the inner workings
of RRDtool. It may help you to sort out why all this
*UNKNOWN* data is popping up in your databases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRDtool gets fed samples/updates
at arbitrary times. From these it builds Primary Data Points
(PDPs) on every &quot;step&quot; interval. The PDPs are then
accumulated into the RRAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;heartbeat&quot;
defines the maximum acceptable interval between
samples/updates. If the interval between samples is less
than &quot;heartbeat&quot;, then an average rate is
calculated and <br>
applied for that interval. If the interval between samples
is longer than &quot;heartbeat&quot;, then that entire
interval is considered &quot;unknown&quot;. Note that there
are other things that <br>
can make a sample interval &quot;unknown&quot;, such as the
rate exceeding limits, or a sample that was explicitly
marked as unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The known rates during a
PDP&rsquo;s &quot;step&quot; interval are used to calculate
an average rate for that PDP. If the total
&quot;unknown&quot; time accounts for more than half the
&quot;step&quot;, the entire <br>
PDP is marked as &quot;unknown&quot;. This means that a
mixture of known and &quot;unknown&quot; sample times in a
single PDP &quot;step&quot; may or may not add up to enough
&quot;known&quot; time to warrant a known <br>
PDP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;heartbeat&quot; can be
short (unusual) or long (typical) relative to the
&quot;step&quot; interval between PDPs. A short
&quot;heartbeat&quot; means you require multiple samples per
PDP, and if you <br>
don&rsquo;t get them mark the PDP unknown. A long heartbeat
can span multiple &quot;steps&quot;, which means it is
acceptable to have multiple PDPs calculated from a single
sample. An extreme <br>
example of this might be a &quot;step&quot; of 5 minutes and
a &quot;heartbeat&quot; of one day, in which case a single
sample every day will result in all the PDPs for that entire
day period being <br>
set to the same average rate. -- Don Baarda

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO MEASURE <br>
Here are a few hints on how to measure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Temperature <br>
Usually you have some type of meter you can read to get the
temperature. The temperature is not really connected with a
time. The only connection is that the temperature <br>
reading happened at a certain time. You can use the GAUGE
data source type for this. RRDtool will then record your
reading together with the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail Messages <br>
Assume you have a method to count the number of messages
transported by your mail server in a certain amount of time,
giving you data like &rsquo;5 messages in the last 65 <br>
seconds&rsquo;. If you look at the count of 5 like an
ABSOLUTE data type you can simply update the RRD with the
number 5 and the end time of your monitoring period. RRDtool
will <br>
then record the number of messages per second. If at some
later stage you want to know the number of messages
transported in a day, you can get the average messages per
<br>
second from RRDtool for the day in question and multiply
this number with the number of seconds in a day. Because all
math is run with Doubles, the precision should be <br>
acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s always a Rate <br>
RRDtool stores rates in amount/second for COUNTER, DERIVE
and ABSOLUTE data. When you plot the data, you will get on
the y axis amount/second which you might be tempted to <br>
convert to an absolute amount by multiplying by the
delta-time between the points. RRDtool plots continuous
data, and as such is not appropriate for plotting absolute
amounts <br>
as for example &quot;total bytes&quot; sent and received in
a router. What you probably want is plot rates that you can
scale to bytes/hour, for example, or plot absolute amounts
with <br>
another tool that draws bar-plots, where the delta-time is
clear on the plot for each point (such that when you read
the graph you see for example GB on the y axis, days on <br>
the x axis and one bar for each day).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
rrdtool create temperature.rrd --step 300
DS:temp:GAUGE:600:-273:5000 RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:1200
RRA:MIN:0.5:12:2400 RRA:MAX:0.5:12:2400
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:2400</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets up an RRD called
temperature.rrd which accepts one temperature value every
300 seconds. If no new data is supplied for more than 600
seconds, the temperature becomes <br>
*UNKNOWN*. The minimum acceptable value is -273 and the
maximum is 5&rsquo;000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few archive areas are also
defined. The first stores the temperatures supplied for 100
hours (1&rsquo;200 * 300 seconds = 100 hours). The second
RRA stores the minimum temperature <br>
recorded over every hour (12 * 300 seconds = 1 hour), for
100 days (2&rsquo;400 hours). The third and the fourth
RRA&rsquo;s do the same for the maximum and average
temperature, <br>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 2 <br>
rrdtool create monitor.rrd --step 300
DS:ifOutOctets:COUNTER:1800:0:4294967295
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016 RRA:HWPREDICT:1440:0.1:0.0035:288</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example is a monitor of a
router interface. The first RRA tracks the traffic flow in
octets; the second RRA generates the specialized functions
RRAs for aberrant behavior <br>
detection. Note that the rra-num argument of HWPREDICT is
missing, so the other RRAs will implicitly be created with
default parameter values. In this example, the forecasting

algorithm baseline adapts quickly; in fact the most recent
one hour of observations (each at 5 minute intervals)
accounts for 75% of the baseline prediction. The linear
trend <br>
forecast adapts much more slowly. Observations made during
the last day (at 288 observations per day) account for only
65% of the predicted linear trend. Note: these computations
<br>
rely on an exponential smoothing formula described in the
LISA 2000 paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The seasonal cycle is one day
(288 data points at 300 second intervals), and the seasonal
adaption parameter will be set to 0.1. The RRD file will
store 5 days (1&rsquo;440 data <br>
points) of forecasts and deviation predictions before wrap
around. The file will store 1 day (a seasonal cycle) of 0-1
indicators in the FAILURES RRA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same RRD file and RRAs are
created with the following command, which explicitly creates
all specialized function RRAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdtool create monitor.rrd
--step 300 DS:ifOutOctets:COUNTER:1800:0:4294967295
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016 RRA:HWPREDICT:1440:0.1:0.0035:288:3
RRA:SEASONAL:288:0.1:2 RRA:DEVPREDICT:1440:5
RRA:DEVSEASONAL:288:0.1:2 RRA:FAILURES:288:7:9:5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, explicit creation
need not replicate implicit create, a number of arguments
could be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE 3 <br>
rrdtool create proxy.rrd --step 300 DS:Total:DERIVE:1800:0:U
DS:Duration:DERIVE:1800:0:U
DS:AvgReqDur:COMPUTE:Duration,Requests,0,EQ,1,Requests,IF,/
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example is monitoring the
average request duration during each 300 sec interval for
requests processed by a web proxy during the interval. In
this case, the proxy exposes <br>
two counters, the number of requests processed since boot
and the total cumulative duration of all processed requests.
Clearly these counters both have some rollover point, but
<br>
using the DERIVE data source also handles the reset that
occurs when the web proxy is stopped and restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the RRD, the first data
source stores the requests per second rate during the
interval. The second data source stores the total duration
of all requests processed during the <br>
interval divided by 300. The COMPUTE data source divides
each PDP of the AccumDuration by the corresponding PDP of
TotalRequests and stores the average request duration. The
<br>
remainder of the RPN expression handles the divide by zero
case.</p>
