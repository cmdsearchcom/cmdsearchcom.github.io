  <i>*UNKNOWN*</i> data.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="filename"><a class="selflink" href="#filename"><i>filename</i></a></h2>
The name of the <b>RRD</b> you want to create. <b>RRD</b> files should end with
  the extension <i>.rrd</i>. However, <b>RRDtool</b> will accept any filename.

A single <b>RRD</b> can accept input from several data sources (<b>DS</b>), for
  example incoming and outgoing traffic on a specific communication line. With
  the <b>DS</b> configuration option you must define some basic properties of
  each data source you want to store in the <b>RRD</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>ds-name</i> is the name you will use to reference this particular data source
  from an <b>RRD</b>. A <i>ds-name</i> must be 1 to 19 characters long in the
  characters [a-zA-Z0-9_].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DST</i> defines the Data Source Type. The remaining arguments of a data
  source entry depend on the data source type. For GAUGE, COUNTER, DERIVE, and
  ABSOLUTE the format for a data source entry is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DS:</b><i>ds-name</i><b>:</b><i>GAUGE | COUNTER | DERIVE |
  ABSOLUTE</i><b>:</b> <i>heartbeat</i><b>:</b><i>min</i><b>:</b><i>max</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For COMPUTE data sources, the format is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>DS:</b><i>ds-name</i><b>:</b><i>COMPUTE</i><b>:</b><i>rpn-expression</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to decide which data source type to use, review the definitions that
  follow. Also consult the section on &quot;HOW TO MEASURE&quot; for further
  insight.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>GAUGE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is for things like temperatures or number of people in a
      room or the value of a RedHat share.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>COUNTER</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is for continuous incrementing counters like the ifInOctets
      counter in a router. The <b>COUNTER</b> data source assumes that the
      counter never decreases, except when a counter overflows. The update
      function takes the overflow into account. The counter is stored as a
      per-second rate. When the counter overflows, RRDtool checks if the
      overflow happened at the 32bit or 64bit border and acts accordingly by
      adding an appropriate value to the result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DERIVE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">will store the derivative of the line going from the last
      to the current value of the data source. This can be useful for gauges,
      for example, to measure the rate of people entering or leaving a room.
      Internally, derive works exactly like COUNTER but without overflow checks.
      So if your counter does not reset at 32 or 64 bit you might want to use
      DERIVE and combine it with a MIN value of 0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>NOTE on COUNTER vs DERIVE</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    by Don Baarda &lt;don.baarda@baesystems.com&gt;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you cannot tolerate ever mistaking the occasional counter reset for a
      legitimate counter wrap, and would prefer &quot;Unknowns&quot; for all
      legitimate counter wraps and resets, always use DERIVE with min=0.
      Otherwise, using COUNTER with a suitable max will return correct values
      for all legitimate counter wraps, mark some counter resets as
      &quot;Unknown&quot;, but can mistake some counter resets for a legitimate
      counter wrap.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For a 5 minute step and 32-bit counter, the probability of mistaking a
      counter reset for a legitimate wrap is arguably about 0.8% per 1Mbps of
      maximum bandwidth. Note that this equates to 80% for 100Mbps interfaces,
      so for high bandwidth interfaces and a 32bit counter, DERIVE with min=0 is
      probably preferable. If you are using a 64bit counter, just about any max
      setting will eliminate the possibility of mistaking a reset for a counter
      wrap.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ABSOLUTE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is for counters which get reset upon reading. This is used
      for fast counters which tend to overflow. So instead of reading them
      normally you reset them after every read to make sure you have a maximum
      time available before the next overflow. Another usage is for things you
      count like number of messages since the last update.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>COMPUTE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is for storing the result of a formula applied to other
      data sources in the <b>RRD</b>. This data source is not supplied a value
      on update, but rather its Primary Data Points (PDPs) are computed from the
      PDPs of the data sources according to the rpn-expression that defines the
      formula. Consolidation functions are then applied normally to the PDPs of
      the COMPUTE data source (that is the rpn-expression is only applied to
      generate PDPs). In database software, such data sets are referred to as
      &quot;virtual&quot; or &quot;computed&quot; columns.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>heartbeat</i> defines the maximum number of seconds that may pass between two
  updates of this data source before the value of the data source is assumed to
  be <i>*UNKNOWN*</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>min</i> and <i>max</i> define the expected range values for data supplied by
  a data source. If <i>min</i> and/or <i>max</i> are specified any value outside
  the defined range will be regarded as <i>*UNKNOWN*</i>. If you do not know or
  care about min and max, set them to U for unknown. Note that min and max
  always refer to the processed values of the DS. For a traffic- <b>COUNTER</b>
  type DS this would be the maximum and minimum data-rate expected from the
  device.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>If information on minimal/maximal expected values is available,</i> <i>always
  set the min and/or max properties. This will help RRDtool in</i> <i>doing a
  simple sanity check on the data supplied when running update.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>rpn-expression</i> defines the formula used to compute the PDPs of a COMPUTE
  data source from other data sources in the same &lt;RRD&gt;. It is similar to
  defining a <b>CDEF</b> argument for the graph command. Please refer to that
  manual page for a list and description of RPN operations supported. For
  COMPUTE data sources, the following RPN operations are not supported: COUNT,
  PREV, TIME, and LTIME. In addition, in defining the RPN expression, the
  COMPUTE data source may only refer to the names of data source listed
  previously in the create command. This is similar to the restriction that
  <b>CDEF</b>s must refer only to <b>DEF</b>s and <b>CDEF</b>s previously
  defined in the same graph command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RRA:CF:cf_arguments"><a class="selflink" href="#RRA:CF:cf_arguments"><b>RRA:</b><i>CF</i><b>:</b><i>cf
  arguments</i></a></h2>
The purpose of an <b>RRD</b> is to store data in the round robin archives (
  <b>RRA</b>). An archive consists of a number of data values or statistics for
  each of the defined data-sources ( <b>DS</b>) and is defined with an
  <b>RRA</b> line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When data is entered into an <b>RRD</b>, it is first fit into time slots of the
  length defined with the <b>-s</b> option, thus becoming a <i>primary</i>
  <i>data point</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data is also processed with the consolidation function ( <i>CF</i>) of the
  archive. There are several consolidation functions that consolidate primary
  data points via an aggregate function: <b>AVERAGE</b>, <b>MIN</b>, <b>MAX</b>,
  <b>LAST</b>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">AVERAGE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the average of the data points is stored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MIN</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the smallest of the data points is stored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MAX</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the largest of the data points is stored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">LAST</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the last data points is used.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that data aggregation inevitably leads to loss of precision and
  information. The trick is to pick the aggregate function such that the
  <i>interesting</i> properties of your data is kept across the aggregation
  process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of <b>RRA</b> line for these consolidation functions is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>RRA:</b><i>AVERAGE | MIN | MAX |
  LAST</i><b>:</b><i>xff</i><b>:</b><i>steps</i> <b>:</b><i>rows</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>xff</i> The xfiles factor defines what part of a consolidation interval may
  be made up from <i>*UNKNOWN*</i> data while the consolidated value is still
  regarded as known. It is given as the ratio of allowed <i>*UNKNOWN*</i> PDPs
  to the number of PDPs in the interval. Thus, it ranges from 0 to 1
  (exclusive).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>steps</i> defines how many of these <i>primary data points</i> are used to
  build a <i>consolidated data point</i> which then goes into the archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>rows</i> defines how many generations of data values are kept in an
  <b>RRA</b>. Obviously, this has to be greater than zero.

  Behavior Detection with Holt-Winters Forecasting</a></h1>
In addition to the aggregate functions, there are a set of specialized functions
  that enable <b>RRDtool</b> to provide data smoothing (via the Holt-Winters
  forecasting algorithm), confidence bands, and the flagging aberrant behavior
  in the data source time series:

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These <b>RRAs</b> differ from the true consolidation functions in several ways.
  First, each of the <b>RRA</b>s is updated once for every primary data point.
  Second, these <b>RRAs</b> are interdependent. To generate real-time confidence
  bounds, a matched set of SEASONAL, DEVSEASONAL, DEVPREDICT, and either
  HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT must exist. Generating smoothed values of the primary
  data points requires a SEASONAL <b>RRA</b> and either an HWPREDICT or
  MHWPREDICT <b>RRA</b>. Aberrant behavior detection requires FAILURES,
  DEVSEASONAL, SEASONAL, and either HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The predicted, or smoothed, values are stored in the HWPREDICT or MHWPREDICT
  <b>RRA</b>. HWPREDICT and MHWPREDICT are actually two variations on the
  Holt-Winters method. They are interchangeable. Both attempt to decompose data
  into three components: a baseline, a trend, and a seasonal coefficient.
  HWPREDICT adds its seasonal coefficient to the baseline to form a prediction,
  whereas MHWPREDICT multiplies its seasonal coefficient by the baseline to form
  a prediction. The difference is noticeable when the baseline changes
  significantly in the course of a season; HWPREDICT will predict the
  seasonality to stay constant as the baseline changes, but MHWPREDICT will
  predict the seasonality to grow or shrink in proportion to the baseline. The
  proper choice of method depends on the thing being modeled. For simplicity,
  the rest of this discussion will refer to HWPREDICT, but MHWPREDICT may be
  substituted in its place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The predicted deviations are stored in DEVPREDICT (think a standard deviation
  which can be scaled to yield a confidence band). The FAILURES <b>RRA</b>
  stores binary indicators. A 1 marks the indexed observation as failure; that
  is, the number of confidence bounds violations in the preceding window of
  observations met or exceeded a specified threshold. An example of using these
  <b>RRAs</b> to graph confidence bounds and failures appears in rrdgraph.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL <b>RRAs</b> store the seasonal coefficients for the
  Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm and the seasonal deviations, respectively.
  There is one entry per observation time point in the seasonal cycle. For
  example, if primary data points are generated every five minutes and the
  seasonal cycle is 1 day, both SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL will have 288 rows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to simplify the creation for the novice user, in addition to supporting
  explicit creation of the HWPREDICT, SEASONAL, DEVPREDICT, DEVSEASONAL, and
  FAILURES <b>RRAs</b>, the <b>RRDtool</b> create command supports implicit
  creation of the other four when HWPREDICT is specified alone and the final
  argument <i>rra-num</i> is omitted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>rows</i> specifies the length of the <b>RRA</b> prior to wrap around.
  Remember that there is a one-to-one correspondence between primary data points
  and entries in these RRAs. For the HWPREDICT CF, <i>rows</i> should be larger
  than the <i>seasonal period</i>. If the DEVPREDICT <b>RRA</b> is implicitly
  created, the default number of rows is the same as the HWPREDICT <i>rows</i>
  argument. If the FAILURES <b>RRA</b> is implicitly created, <i>rows</i> will
  be set to the <i>seasonal</i> <i>period</i> argument of the HWPREDICT
  <b>RRA</b>. Of course, the <b>RRDtool</b> <i>resize</i> command is available
  if these defaults are not sufficient and the creator wishes to avoid explicit
  creations of the other specialized function <b>RRAs</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>seasonal period</i> specifies the number of primary data points in a seasonal
  cycle. If SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL are implicitly created, this argument for
  those <b>RRAs</b> is set automatically to the value specified by HWPREDICT. If
  they are explicitly created, the creator should verify that all three
  <i>seasonal period</i> arguments agree.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>alpha</i> is the adaption parameter of the intercept (or baseline)
  coefficient in the Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm. See rrdtool for a
  description of this algorithm. <i>alpha</i> must lie between 0 and 1. A value
  closer to 1 means that more recent observations carry greater weight in
  predicting the baseline component of the forecast. A value closer to 0 means
  that past history carries greater weight in predicting the baseline component.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>beta</i> is the adaption parameter of the slope (or linear trend) coefficient
  in the Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm. <i>beta</i> must lie between 0 and
  1 and plays the same role as <i>alpha</i> with respect to the predicted linear
  trend.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>gamma</i> is the adaption parameter of the seasonal coefficients in the
  Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm (HWPREDICT) or the adaption parameter in
  the exponential smoothing update of the seasonal deviations. It must lie
  between 0 and 1. If the SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL <b>RRAs</b> are created
  implicitly, they will both have the same value for <i>gamma</i>: the value
  specified for the HWPREDICT <i>alpha</i> argument. Note that because there is
  one seasonal coefficient (or deviation) for each time point during the
  seasonal cycle, the adaptation rate is much slower than the baseline. Each
  seasonal coefficient is only updated (or adapts) when the observed value
  occurs at the offset in the seasonal cycle corresponding to that coefficient.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL <b>RRAs</b> are created explicitly, <i>gamma</i>
  need not be the same for both. Note that <i>gamma</i> can also be changed via
  the <b>RRDtool</b> <i>tune</i> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>smoothing-window</i> specifies the fraction of a season that should be
  averaged around each point. By default, the value of <i>smoothing-window</i>
  is 0.05, which means each value in SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL will be
  occasionally replaced by averaging it with its ( <i>seasonal period</i>*0.05)
  nearest neighbors. Setting <i>smoothing-window</i> to zero will disable the
  running-average smoother altogether.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>rra-num</i> provides the links between related <b>RRAs</b>. If HWPREDICT is
  specified alone and the other <b>RRAs</b> are created implicitly, then there
  is no need to worry about this argument. If <b>RRAs</b> are created
  explicitly, then carefully pay attention to this argument. For each <b>RRA</b>
  which includes this argument, there is a dependency between that <b>RRA</b>
  and another <b>RRA</b>. The <i>rra-num</i> argument is the 1-based index in
  the order of <b>RRA</b> creation (that is, the order they appear in the
  <i>create</i> command). The dependent <b>RRA</b> for each <b>RRA</b> requiring
  the <i>rra-num</i> argument is listed here:

<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>threshold</i> is the minimum number of violations (observed values outside
  the confidence bounds) within a window that constitutes a failure. If the
  FAILURES <b>RRA</b> is implicitly created, the default value is 7.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>window length</i> is the number of time points in the window. Specify an
  integer greater than or equal to the threshold and less than or equal to 28.
  The time interval this window represents depends on the interval between
  primary data points. If the FAILURES <b>RRA</b> is implicitly created, the
  default value is 9.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="The_HEARTBEAT_and_the_STEP"><a class="selflink" href="#The_HEARTBEAT_and_the_STEP">The
  HEARTBEAT and the STEP</a></h1>
Here is an explanation by Don Baarda on the inner workings of RRDtool. It may
  help you to sort out why all this *UNKNOWN* data is popping up in your
  databases:
<div class="Pp"></div>
RRDtool gets fed samples/updates at arbitrary times. From these it builds
  Primary Data Points (PDPs) on every &quot;step&quot; interval. The PDPs are
  then accumulated into the RRAs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;heartbeat&quot; defines the maximum acceptable interval between
  samples/updates. If the interval between samples is less than
  &quot;heartbeat&quot;, then an average rate is calculated and applied for that
  interval. If the interval between samples is longer than
  &quot;heartbeat&quot;, then that entire interval is considered
  &quot;unknown&quot;. Note that there are other things that can make a sample
  interval &quot;unknown&quot;, such as the rate exceeding limits, or a sample
  that was explicitly marked as unknown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The known rates during a PDP's &quot;step&quot; interval are used to calculate
  an average rate for that PDP. If the total &quot;unknown&quot; time accounts
  for more than <b>half</b> the &quot;step&quot;, the entire PDP is marked as
  &quot;unknown&quot;. This means that a mixture of known and
  &quot;unknown&quot; sample times in a single PDP &quot;step&quot; may or may
  not add up to enough &quot;known&quot; time to warrant a known PDP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;heartbeat&quot; can be short (unusual) or long (typical) relative to
  the &quot;step&quot; interval between PDPs. A short &quot;heartbeat&quot;
  means you require multiple samples per PDP, and if you don't get them mark the
  PDP unknown. A long heartbeat can span multiple &quot;steps&quot;, which means
  it is acceptable to have multiple PDPs calculated from a single sample. An
  extreme example of this might be a &quot;step&quot; of 5 minutes and a
  &quot;heartbeat&quot; of one day, in which case a single sample every day will
  result in all the PDPs for that entire day period being set to the same
  average rate. <i>-- Don Baarda &lt;don.baarda@baesystems.com&gt;</i>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOW_TO_MEASURE"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_TO_MEASURE">HOW
  TO MEASURE</a></h1>
Here are a few hints on how to measure:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Temperature</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Usually you have some type of meter you can read to get the
      temperature. The temperature is not really connected with a time. The only
      connection is that the temperature reading happened at a certain time. You
      can use the <b>GAUGE</b> data source type for this. RRDtool will then
      record your reading together with the time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Mail Messages</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Assume you have a method to count the number of messages
      transported by your mail server in a certain amount of time, giving you
      data like '5 messages in the last 65 seconds'. If you look at the count of
      5 like an <b>ABSOLUTE</b> data type you can simply update the RRD with the
      number 5 and the end time of your monitoring period. RRDtool will then
      record the number of messages per second. If at some later stage you want
      to know the number of messages transported in a day, you can get the
      average messages per second from RRDtool for the day in question and
      multiply this number with the number of seconds in a day. Because all math
      is run with Doubles, the precision should be acceptable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">It's always a Rate</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">RRDtool stores rates in amount/second for COUNTER, DERIVE
      and ABSOLUTE data. When you plot the data, you will get on the y axis
      amount/second which you might be tempted to convert to an absolute amount
      by multiplying by the delta-time between the points. RRDtool plots
      continuous data, and as such is not appropriate for plotting absolute
      amounts as for example &quot;total bytes&quot; sent and received in a
      router. What you probably want is plot rates that you can scale to
      bytes/hour, for example, or plot absolute amounts with another tool that
      draws bar-plots, where the delta-time is clear on the plot for each point
      (such that when you read the graph you see for example GB on the y axis,
      days on the x axis and one bar for each day).</dd>
</dl>

 rrdtool create temperature.rrd --step 300 \
  DS:temp:GAUGE:600:-273:5000 \
  RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:1200 \
  RRA:MIN:0.5:12:2400 \
  RRA:MAX:0.5:12:2400 \
  RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:2400
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This sets up an <b>RRD</b> called <i>temperature.rrd</i> which accepts one
  temperature value every 300 seconds. If no new data is supplied for more than
  600 seconds, the temperature becomes <i>*UNKNOWN*</i>. The minimum acceptable
  value is -273 and the maximum is 5'000.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A few archive areas are also defined. The first stores the temperatures supplied
  for 100 hours (1'200 * 300 seconds = 100 hours). The second RRA stores the
  minimum temperature recorded over every hour (12 * 300 seconds = 1 hour), for
  100 days (2'400 hours). The third and the fourth RRA's do the same for the
  maximum and average temperature, respectively.

 rrdtool create monitor.rrd --step 300        \
   DS:ifOutOctets:COUNTER:1800:0:4294967295   \
   RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016                     \
   RRA:HWPREDICT:1440:0.1:0.0035:288
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example is a monitor of a router interface. The first <b>RRA</b> tracks the
  traffic flow in octets; the second <b>RRA</b> generates the specialized
  functions <b>RRAs</b> for aberrant behavior detection. Note that the
  <i>rra-num</i> argument of HWPREDICT is missing, so the other <b>RRAs</b> will
  implicitly be created with default parameter values. In this example, the
  forecasting algorithm baseline adapts quickly; in fact the most recent one
  hour of observations (each at 5 minute intervals) accounts for 75% of the
  baseline prediction. The linear trend forecast adapts much more slowly.
  Observations made during the last day (at 288 observations per day) account
  for only 65% of the predicted linear trend. Note: these computations rely on
  an exponential smoothing formula described in the LISA 2000 paper.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The seasonal cycle is one day (288 data points at 300 second intervals), and the
  seasonal adaption parameter will be set to 0.1. The RRD file will store 5 days
  (1'440 data points) of forecasts and deviation predictions before wrap around.
  The file will store 1 day (a seasonal cycle) of 0-1 indicators in the FAILURES
  <b>RRA</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same RRD file and <b>RRAs</b> are created with the following command, which
  explicitly creates all specialized function <b>RRAs</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 rrdtool create monitor.rrd --step 300 \
   DS:ifOutOctets:COUNTER:1800:0:4294967295 \
   RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016 \
   RRA:HWPREDICT:1440:0.1:0.0035:288:3 \
   RRA:SEASONAL:288:0.1:2 \
   RRA:DEVPREDICT:1440:5 \
   RRA:DEVSEASONAL:288:0.1:2 \
   RRA:FAILURES:288:7:9:5
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, explicit creation need not replicate implicit create, a number of
  arguments could be changed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_3"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE_3">EXAMPLE
  3</a></h1>
<pre>
 rrdtool create proxy.rrd --step 300 \
   DS:Total:DERIVE:1800:0:U  \
   DS:Duration:DERIVE:1800:0:U  \
   DS:AvgReqDur:COMPUTE:Duration,Requests,0,EQ,1,Requests,IF,/ \
   RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example is monitoring the average request duration during each 300 sec
  interval for requests processed by a web proxy during the interval. In this
  case, the proxy exposes two counters, the number of requests processed since
  boot and the total cumulative duration of all processed requests. Clearly
  these counters both have some rollover point, but using the DERIVE data source
  also handles the reset that occurs when the web proxy is stopped and
  restarted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the <b>RRD</b>, the first data source stores the requests per second rate
  during the interval. The second data source stores the total duration of all
  requests processed during the interval divided by 300. The COMPUTE data source
  divides each PDP of the AccumDuration by the corresponding PDP of
  TotalRequests and stores the average request duration. The remainder of the
  RPN expression handles the divide by zero case.
