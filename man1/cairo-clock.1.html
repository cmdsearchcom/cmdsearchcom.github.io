<p>CAIRO-CLOCK(1) some dope-shit-funky time display
CAIRO-CLOCK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cairo-clock - an analog clock drawn with vector-graphics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cairo-clock [--x X] [--y Y] [--width WIDTH] [--height
HEIGHT] [--seconds] [--date] [--theme name] [--ontop]
[--pager] [--taskbar] [--sticky] [--twelve] [--twentyfour]
[--refresh] <br>
cairo-clock -h, --help <br>
cairo-clock -v, --version <br>
cairo-clock -l, --list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the usage of the
cairo-clock program. You can move the clock around with your
mouse by pressing and holding the left mouse-button and
dragging <br>
your mouse around. The clock will follow your movements. To
resize the clock you have to press and hold the middle
mouse-button down and drag your mouse around. The upper-left
<br>
corner of the clock will follow your movements. Just
clicking the right mouse-button on the clock will bring up
the popup-menu. You find three menu-items. Properties, Info
and <br>
Quit. Selecting the Properties item will bring up a dialog
where you can change all available features of the clock
(e.g. size, theme, display of optional elements, pager- and
<br>
taskbar-behaviour). The next menu-item, Info, will bring up
an informational dialog stating the name of program, current
version, author and license information. The third and <br>
last menu-item, Quit, really exits the program if you select
it. Surprised?! ;-) You can also hit the ESC-key if you want
to exit the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to install
additional themes for the clock you downloaded from the
internet you can best place them in you home-directory under
~/.cairo-clock/themes. You proably <br>
have to create that directory-structure the first time you
install new themes. A theme there goes in a directory like
e.g. ~/.cairo-clock/theme/new_theme. Once you copied the
<br>
new themes directory there you will be able to select it via
the Properties dialog in the theme-selection widget after a
restart of the program. The theme-directories are only <br>
scanned during program-start. The newly added 24h-mode for
cairo-clock will need you to select any of the supplied
24h-themes. While the clock will run without any problems if
<br>
you switch to 24h-mode and still use a 12h-based theme, you
are going to want to select a 24h-based theme in order to
make any sense of the displayed hand-positions in
24h-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
cairo-clock now uses common GNU-convention for
commandline-options. Take note that using
commandline-options overrules everything which maybe stored
in your local settings-file. <br>
Using the commandline-options will completely ignore any
settings you may have stored in your local settings-file.
Every option will default to program-internal settings. A
sum&acirc; <br>
mary of options is included below. There is no Info file on
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xposition X <br>
The initial x-position of the top-left window-corner of the
clock will be X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --yposition Y <br>
The initial y-position of the top-left window-corner of the
clock will be Y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --width WIDTH <br>
Initially open the window of the clock with a width of
WIDTH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --height HEIGHT <br>
Initially open the window of the clock with a height of
HEIGHT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --seconds <br>
Passing this means to render the seconds-hand. If you leave
this out no seconds-hand will be drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --date <br>
Passing this means to render the date-display. If you leave
this out no date will be drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List all themes installed system-wide and locally for the
current user and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --theme NAME <br>
Use theme NAME for rendering. Use the any of the names
returned by the options -l or --list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --ontop <br>
Passing this means the clock-window will stay above all
other windows. If you leave this out other windows can
overlap the clock-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pager <br>
Passing this means the clock-window will appear in the
pager. If you leave this out the pager will ignore the
clock-window and not display it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --taskbar <br>
Passing this means the clock-window will show up in the
taskbar. If you leave this out the clock-window will not
show up in the taskbar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --sticky <br>
Passing this means to have the clock-window appear all your
workspaces. If you leave this out the clock will only be
visible on the current workspace from where you ini&acirc;
<br>
tially started cairo-clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --twelve <br>
Passing this will force the hour hand to use commonly known
12h per full circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --twentyfour <br>
Passing this will cause the hour hand to spread 24h across a
full circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --refresh RATE <br>
Use an animation-refreshrate of RATE for rendering. Use this
with caution! Possible values are 1..60 Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a usage-description and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the programs version-number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If redraws don&rsquo;t happen every second (the second-hand
is drawn) the needed refresh after a window-size change via
the preferences-dialog only happens on a
minute-interval.</p>
