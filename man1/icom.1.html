<b>icom</b> [ -r radio ] [ -c channel ] [ -m mode ] [-o offset ] [ -g frequency
  ] [ -f file] [ -adk ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program controls ICOM radio transceivers and receivers with the CI-V
  option. Most recent ICOM radios already have this option; older radios can be
  converted with an appropriate adapter mounted inside the radio. Up to four
  CI-V radios can be connected to a single serial port using a level converter
  such as the CT-17, which includes a MAX232 chip and not much else.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program implements a virtual radio with a bank of memory channels
  corresponding to the particular radio model. Each channel can hold frequency,
  mode and, in the case of VHF/UHF FM radios, transmit duplex offset. The
  virtual radio also includes a variable-frequency oscillator (VFO) scratch
  register, which controls the actual receiver frequency, and several values
  used to control the tuning and mode selection functions. Most radios support
  USB, LSB, AM, CW and RTTY modes; some support narrow/wide filters and some
  support FM modes as well. Additional features that can be controlled on some
  radios are antenna selection, scan control, main dial tuning step and several
  other functions implemented in the various radio models.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The actual VFO frequency, mode and transmit duplex offset is controlled directly
  by the program. All other registers and memory channels are accessed via the
  VFO, which can be loaded from a selected memory channel, modified and written
  back to the same or different channel. When implemented, the actual secondary
  VFO is controlled by loading from, or exchanging contents with, the VFO. Other
  functions, such as tuning step, tuning rate and compensation for the actual
  radio oscillator frequency errors, are performed in software.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program knows about most early and late model ICOM radios. The program can
  be told which model is present or directed to scan for all known models and
  report each one found. A number of diagnostic tests are performed on the
  selected radio to determine which options are present and to initialize to a
  known state. The program detects certain anomalistic behavior of some radios
  and adjusts its operations to make the behavior conform to the model virtual
  radio.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program operates in one of three modes: keyboard batch, and keypad. In
  keyboard mode, commands and arguments are entered from the keyboard following
  the <b>icom&gt;</b> prompt, one command per line, and the complete command set
  is available. In batch mode, the same commands and arguments are read from the
  file specified as an option in the command line. In keypad mode, commands and
  arguments are entered from the keyboard and numeric keypad following the
  <b>&gt;</b> prompt. In this mode, most routine keystrokes use the numeric
  keypad to enter arguments, and the arguments are followed by a single
  character representing the command name. Shortcut arrow keys on the keyboard
  (not the numeric keypad) are used to do routine things like tune up/down or
  increase/decrease the tuning rate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options on the command line can be used to select the radio model and set the
  frequency and mode. Using a suitably crafted Unix <b>crontab</b> file, it is
  possible to tune a radio to different frequencies used by a shortwave
  broadcaster throughout the day, for example. With the <b>minimuf</b> program
  (available in a separate distribution), it is possible to build shell scripts
  that predict the most likely frequencies and tune the radio accordingly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program includes features to control scanning on some radios and transmit
  duplex/split on others. It also includes an optional feature to control the
  audio codec on Sun workstations. This feature can be used in connection with
  multimedia conferencing programs developed by the Internet research community.
  The receiver audio is connected to the workstation and a MBONE session started
  with the <b>vat</b> audio tool running. A remote operator can control the
  receiver via a telnet session and use the feature to control the gain, select
  the input port and mute the speaker as necessary.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BASIC_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#BASIC_OPERATION">BASIC
  OPERATION</a></h1>
Most commands and command line options take arguments, although many arguments
  can be defaulted. Unsigned floating-point frequency arguments specify an
  absolute VFO frequency in MHz, if less than 1000, and in kHz otherwise. Signed
  floating-point (preceded by an explicit <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> character)
  frequency arguments specify an offset relative to the current VFO frequency in
  kHz. Signed or unsigned floating-point offset arguments specify a transmit
  duplex, split or beat-frequency oscillator (BFO) frequency offset in kHz.
  Signed or unsigned integer step arguments specify a tuning step in Hz.
  Unsigned integer channel arguments specify a memory channel number ranging
  from 1 to the highest available in the particular radio. A channel number
  specified as '.' means the currently selected channel and '$' the highest
  channel available. Other numeric and character string arguments take values
  according to the help menus described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the most common function is tuning the radio to different frequencies or
  scanning a band of frequencies, a compact convention is provided. In either
  keyboard, keypad or batch modes, a valid signed or unsigned floating-point
  number occurring as the first token on a command line is an implicit command
  to set the VFO frequency and may be followed by a mode specification. In
  addition, for most commands and arguments, a question mark '?' appearing in
  either a command or argument position causes help information for that command
  or argument to be displayed. The information is in two columns - the first
  shows a command or option name string, while the second column shows a brief
  description of the function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program exits when command line options are processed and the command line
  includes any option other than <b>-r</b>, <b>-i</b> or <b>-f</b>. This is
  designed for use in shell scripts where all functions can be completed using
  only command line options. Keyboard mode is signalled by the prefix
  <b>icom&gt;</b>, while keypad mode is signalled by the prefix <b>&gt;</b> and
  batch mode has no prefix. Keyboard and batch commands are terminated by the
  <b>ENTER</b> key on either the keyboard or numeric keypad. Keypad commands are
  terminated by a special character depending on the command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A radio must be selected before any command which controls it. This can be done
  using the <b>radio</b> command in either keyboard or batch modes and the
  <b>-r</b> command line option. The behavior of the <b>radio</b> command with
  no argument depends on whether a radio has already been selected. If not, the
  program scans the CI-V bus for all known radios and for each one found
  displays a capability line showing the radio name and tuning range. If a radio
  has already been selected, only its capability line is displayed. The
  <b>radio</b> command with valid argument can be used at any time to reselect a
  different radio, but only one can be active at any given time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>chan</b> command selects the memory channel and transfers its contents,
  including the frequency, mode and transmit duplex offset to the VFO. The
  <b>freq</b> command sets the VFO frequency, but does not affect the mode.
  Likewise, the <b>mode</b> command sets the mode without affecting the
  frequency. For VHF/UHF radios, the <b>duplex</b> command sets the offset;
  however, at least with the 271, there appears no obvious means to set the sign
  of this offset. The <b>write</b> command writes the VFO frequency, mode and
  offset to the memory channel, destroying its prior contents. The <b>clear</b>
  command clears the memory channel for those radios that support it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some ICOM radios do not compensate the local oscillator (LO) when the mode is
  changed and the BFO is shifted in the passband. This has the unfortunate
  effect of detuning the radio by an amount up to 3 kHz when the mode is
  changed. When one of these radios are detected during initialization, the
  program rewrites the frequency each time the mode is set. In the case of
  transceivers with general-coverage receivers, care should be given to the
  setting of the GENE-HAM switch. If in the HAM position, it is not possible to
  change to a frequency outside the ham bands. Since the setting of this switch
  is saved along with the frequency and mode in a channel and apparently cannot
  be changed using radio commands, the setting may have to be done manually.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TUNING_OPERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#TUNING_OPERATIONS">TUNING
  OPERATIONS</a></h1>
The keyboard mode can be very awkward when searching a band for signals, since a
  new command must be used every time the frequency is changed. The
  <b>keypad</b> command puts the program in keypad mode and changes the prompt
  string to &quot;&gt;&quot;. In this mode, arguments such as frequency, tuning
  step, etc., can be entered directly from the keyboard and numeric keypad. Of
  course, the keypad must be in <b>Num Lock</b> mode for this to work properly.
  In keypad mode, the arguments are given first followed by a single character
  which identifies the command and terminates input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most ICOM radios tune in 10-Hz steps, while some HF radios tune in 1-Hz steps
  and some VHF/UHF radios tune in 100-Hz steps. The program determines the
  minimum tuning step during initialization and adjusts the various displays and
  control ranges accordingly. The easiest way to tune the radio is using keypad
  mode and the arrow keys. The <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> arrow keys adjust the
  frequency up or down one step. The <b>LEFT</b> and <b>RIGHT</b> arrow keys
  decrease and increase the tuning rate (Hz per step) respectively. The rate
  values begin at the minimum tuning step and extend in 1-2.5-5-10 steps to 5
  MHz per step.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each press of the <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> keys displays the current frequency,
  mode and either transmit duplex offset or split offset. The display is also
  produced by other commands that change these quantities. Each press of the
  <b>LEFT</b> and <b>RIGHT</b> keys displays the current tuning rate. Each press
  of the <b>ENTER</b> key displays the current VFO frequency and mode. If
  preceded by a single <b>+</b> or <b>-</b>, the memory channel is incremented
  or decremented, respectively, and the contents of that channel replace the
  VFO. VFO frequencies can be entered directly using the keypad <b>+</b>,
  <b>-</b>, <b>.</b>, digit and <b>ENTER</b> keys. With a little practice, it is
  easy to scan a band (say with 1-kHz steps in USB) looking for signals and,
  when one is found, change to 100-Hz steps to move closer and then to 10-Hz
  steps for the final adjustment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the arrow keys, the VFO frequency values are constrained to follow integral
  multiples of the rate values. This prevents leaving the radio on some odd
  frequency, increasing the tuning rate and finding the actual tuning steps
  landing on odd values. When necessary, The <b>step</b> keyboard command or
  <b>s</b> keypad command can be used to change the tuning step to arbitrary
  values. This is useful in some channelized services with non-integral channel
  spacings, as in the maritime radio services. The <b>rate</b> keyboard command
  can be used to set the rate directly.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TRANSMIT/RECEIVE_SPLIT_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#TRANSMIT/RECEIVE_SPLIT_OPERATION">TRANSMIT/RECEIVE
  SPLIT OPERATION</a></h1>
The 775 and 781 HF transceivers have an auxiliary receiver and VFO that can be
  very useful in some operating modes, especially for working DX and contests.
  When split mode is in effect, the main VFO is used for receiving and the
  auxiliary VFO for transmitting. When dual-watch is enabled, the audio from
  both receivers can be combined in a selectable ratio. The control program
  supports both features using keyboard and keypad commands and one of several
  operating procedures. Commands are provided to load the transmit VFO from the
  receive VFO with selected offset, load the receive VFO from the transmit VFO
  with selected offset, and to swap transmit and receive VFO contents. Upon
  happening on a DX station, for example, its frequency can be saved temporarily
  in the transmit VFO by the <b>0&gt;</b> keystrokes, then the receive VFO
  retuned &quot;up ten&quot; to a quiet spot. The VFO contents are then swapped
  by the <b>=</b> keystroke. If the DX station requests calls on frequency, the
  <b>&lt;</b> keystroke restores the receive VFO from the transmit VFO. The
  split can be toggled on and off with the <b>&gt;</b> keystroke. Many
  variations in these procedures are possible.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FM_DUPLEX_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#FM_DUPLEX_OPERATION">FM
  DUPLEX OPERATION</a></h1>
Ordinarily, FM repeater operations require that the station receiving on a
  frequency transmit at a fixed offset relative to that frequency. This
  operation is automatic with most VHF/UHF transceivers and keyboard commands
  are provided to read and write the transmit duplex offset. Keyboard commands
  are available to specify the duplex offset and sign, although some VHF/UHF
  transceivers apparently have no provision to control the sign of the offset.
  However, sometimes it is necessary to listen on the repeater input frequency,
  instead of the normal repeater output frequency. To support this feature, the
  keypad <b>/</b> keystroke alternates between the repeater input and output
  frequencies.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCANNING_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#SCANNING_OPERATION">SCANNING
  OPERATION</a></h1>
For those radios the support scanning, a number of commands are provided to
  start the operation in various modes and capture the frequencies found. The
  general procdure is to start the scan and wait for scanning to stop, usually
  when the squelch is broken. At this time, the frequency that stopped the scan
  is displayed and can be written to a channel with the <b>write</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>band</b> command can be used to set the low and high band edges for
  software scanning. This can be used to search a specific band for channelized
  services, such as the broadcasting, aviation and marine radio bands. Once the
  band edges and frequency step have been selected, the keyboard <b>UP</b> and
  <b>DOWN</b> arrow keys can be used to step the frequency through the band.
  When stepped above the high band edge, the frequency is set to the low band
  edge. When stepped below the low band edge, the frequency is set to the high
  band edge.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OSCILLATOR_CALIBRATION"><a class="selflink" href="#OSCILLATOR_CALIBRATION">OSCILLATOR
  CALIBRATION</a></h1>
Some ICOM radios, including the 775 and 781, synthesize all oscillator signals
  from a single master oscillator. Once the master oscillator frequency is
  accurately calibrated, the various LO and BFO signals will be exactly on
  frequency. Other ICOM radios synthesize the LO signal, but use an independent
  oscillator for the BFO signal. In these radios, the BFO frequency is shifted
  using a varactor and a network of diodes and resistors to generate the
  necessary BFO frequencies. This method is not very accurate when remotely
  tuning the radio to a narrowband RTTY or packet transmission, for example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program has provisions to compensate for the systematic errors in both the
  synthesized LO signal and varactor-switched BFO signals. This is done by
  adjusting the VFO frequency to compensate for the systematic LO error and
  individual BFO errors. The LO correction is provided by the <b>comp</b>
  command, while the BFO corrections are provided by the USB, LSB, CW, RTTY, AM
  and FM mode commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The calibration procedure for single-oscillator radios like the 775 and 781 is
  simple. Tune the radio to a WWV frequency, preferably the highest one heard
  and listen for the 500-Hz or 600-Hz modulation tones is present. In keypad
  mode, switch between USB and LSB modes and adjust the frequency using the
  <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> arrow keys until the tones sound the same. The
  difference between the indicated frequency and actual frequency can be read
  directly from the display or from the radio. Divide this difference by the
  actual frequency to calculate the VFO compensation in PPM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For two-oscillator radios, the calibration procedure requires two frequencies,
  such as WWV on 10 MHz and 20 MHz, for example. First, listen for the tones on
  the 10 MHz frequency and use the above procedure, but with AM mode substituted
  for one of the SSB modes. Then, listen for the tones on the 20 MHz and do the
  same thing. The LO error is computed as the difference between the 20 MHz and
  10 MHz differences divided by the difference in the two WWV frequencies, in
  this case 10 MHz, is the LO frequency error and the value of the VFO
  compensation in PPM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The calibration procedure continues for each BFO separately. Starting with a WWV
  signal at any frequency, use the above procedure to measure the difference
  between the indicated and actual frequencies for each of the four BFO modes
  USB, LSB, CW and RTTY. Enter the corrections the argument to the mode command
  of the same name. If desired, the CW and/or RTTY BFO frequencies can be
  artificially tweaked to move the center frequency to other than the standard
  offset. These offsets will be automatically programmed each time the VFO
  frequency is changed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHANNEL_PALETTES"><a class="selflink" href="#CHANNEL_PALETTES">CHANNEL
  PALETTES</a></h1>
When using this program to operate more than one radio that covers the same
  frequency bands and modes, it may be useful to use a standard set of files,
  which could be loaded into any of the radios directly from the file. The
  program includes the capability to save and restore a block of memory channels
  to and from a file using the <b>save</b> and <b>restore</b> commands. This
  allows channel blocks to be created by other programs and copied from one
  radio to another, for example. The information saved in the file includes the
  frequency, mode and offset. The program can also execute a list of commands
  stored in a file and interpreted in batch mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, it often happens that individual radios need slightly different
  frequency settings to receive the same frequency transmission, especially when
  narrow filters are in use. A common example is when selecting from a standard
  set of frequencies provided by the <b>minimuf</b> program (described
  elsewhere) and a Unix <b>cron</b> to automatically tune the radio(s)
  throughout the day. The standard frequencies can be maintained in a batch file
  common to all radios and loaded by the <b>restore</b> batch command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, the <b>cron</b> script can provide both the frequency <b>-g</b> and
  individual offset <b>-o</b> values specific to each radio on the command line.
  The program adds this offset, along with others provided by the <b>offset</b>
  and <b>mode</b> commands, if used, as the frequency is transmitted to the
  radio. Usually, the offset is characteristic of the radio, as the result of
  BFO frequency error, for example, and can be calibrated manually in advance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Batch mode is designed for cases where a number of radios are to be cloned or
  programmed with memory channel data produced by another program. In principle,
  a Unix shell script could search an archive for the current VOA transmission
  schedules and transmitter locations, another program determine the propagation
  model and best frequencies for the receiver location and current time of day,
  and then program the radio(s) with the results.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERFACE_DEBUGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERFACE_DEBUGGING">INTERFACE
  DEBUGGING</a></h1>
The program communicates with one or more radios using the CI-V broadcast bus
  and serial asynchronous protocol. The CT-17 level converter can be used to
  interface the CI-V voltage levels (TTL) to EIA (RS-232) levels, or a homebrew
  unit can be made from the MAX232 IC plus a handful of capacitors. The CT-17
  supports up to four radios, but there is no inherent protocol limitation to
  this number. The CI-V uses active-low drivers with resistor pullups, so
  multiple radios can be connected to the same wire.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Messages are exchanged in the form of frames beginning with two preamble bytes
  (0xfe) and ending with one end of message byte (0xfd). In order to handle the
  older radios, the control program operates at 1200 bps; however, it can be
  compiled to operate at higher speeds. Each radio model is assigned a unique
  identifier byte, which can be changed if necessary. The control program sends
  a frame with that identifier and expects a reply, either containing data or a
  single ACK (0xfb) or NAK (0xfa). Most functions implemented by the control
  program require an exchange of several frames.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It has been the experience that some radios can occasionally fail to respond to
  a command or respond with a mangled frame. Therefore, the control program
  includes a good deal of error recovery code and uses timeouts and
  retransmissions as necessary. Since the CI-V bus uses a broadcast
  architecture, every octet transmitted by the control program is read back for
  verification. If the readback fails or no reply is received after three
  retransmissions, the operation fails and an error message is displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>trace</b> command can be used to watch the protocol interactions between
  the program and radios. The argument <b>bus</b> enables packet trace. The
  trace operates from received octets, either a readback of a transmitted frame
  preceded by &quot;T:&quot; or a copy of a received frame preceded by
  &quot;R:&quot;. Each transmission is repeated up to three times in case of
  error, after which the operation fails and is reported as an error. The
  argument <b>packet</b> enables bus error messages, which are normally
  suppressed until the maximum retry limit is reached.
