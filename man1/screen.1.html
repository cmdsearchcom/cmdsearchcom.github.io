<p>SCREEN(1) General Commands Manual SCREEN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal
emulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
screen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ] <br>
screen -r [[pid.]tty[.host]] <br>
screen -r sessionowner/[[pid.]tty[.host]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a
physical terminal between several processes (typically
interactive shells). Each virtual terminal provides the
func&acirc; <br>
tions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several
control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64)
and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support
for <br>
multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history
buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste
mechanism that allows moving text regions between
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When screen is called, it
creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified
command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use
the program as you normally <br>
would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen)
windows with other programs in them (including more shells),
kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn
out&acirc; <br>
put logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows,
view the scrollback history, switch between windows in
whatever manner you wish, etc. All windows run their
programs <br>
completely independent of each other. Programs continue to
run when their window is currently not visible and even when
the whole screen session is detached from the user&rsquo;s
ter&acirc; <br>
minal. When a program terminates, screen (per default) kills
the window that contained it. If this window was in the
foreground, the display switches to the previous window; if
<br>
none are left, screen exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Everything you type is sent to
the program running in the current window. The only
exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to
initiate a command to the window man&acirc; <br>
ager. By default, each command begins with a control-a
(abbreviated C-a from now on), and is followed by one other
keystroke. The command character and all the key bindings
can <br>
be fully customized to be anything you like, though they are
always two characters in length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen does not understand the
prefix &quot;C-&quot; to mean control. Please use the caret
notation (&quot;^A&quot; instead of &quot;C-a&quot;) as
arguments to e.g. the escape command or the -e option. <br>
Screen will also print out control characters in caret
notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard way to create a new
window is to type &quot;C-a c&quot;. This creates a new
window running a shell and switches to that window
immediately, regardless of the state of the <br>
process running in the current window. Similarly, you can
create a new window with a custom command in it by first
binding the command to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file
or <br>
at the &quot;C-a :&quot; command line) and then using it
just like the &quot;C-a c&quot; command. In addition, new
windows can be created by running a command like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen emacs prog.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from a shell prompt within a
previously created window. This will not run another copy of
screen, but will instead supply the command name and its
arguments to the window man&acirc; <br>
ager (specified in the $STY environment variable) who will
use it to create the new window. The above example would
start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch to its
<br>
window. - Note that you cannot transport environment
variables from the invoking shell to the application (emacs
in this case), because it is forked from the parent screen
<br>
process, not from the invoking shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;/etc/utmp&quot; is
writable by screen, an appropriate record will be written to
this file for each window, and removed when the window is
terminated. This is useful for working <br>
with &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;script&quot;,
&quot;shutdown&quot;, &quot;rsend&quot;, &quot;sccs&quot;
and other similar programs that use the utmp file to
determine who you are. As long as screen is active on your
terminal, the <br>
terminal&rsquo;s own record is removed from the utmp file.
See also &quot;C-a L&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Before you begin to use screen you&rsquo;ll need to make
sure you have correctly selected your terminal type, just as
you would for any other termcap/terminfo program. (You can
do <br>
this by using tset for example.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re impatient and
want to get started without doing a lot more reading, you
should remember this one command: &quot;C-a ?&quot;. Typing
these two characters will display a list of <br>
the available screen commands and their bindings. Each
keystroke is discussed in the section &quot;DEFAULT KEY
BINDINGS&quot;. The manual section &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot;
deals with the contents of <br>
your .screenrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your terminal is a
&quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal (it doesn&rsquo;t
allow the last position on the screen to be updated without
scrolling the screen) consider using a version of your <br>
terminal&rsquo;s termcap that has automatic margins turned
off. This will ensure an accurate and optimal update of the
screen in all circumstances. Most terminals nowadays have
&quot;magic&quot; <br>
margins (automatic margins plus usable last column). This is
the VT100 style type and perfectly suited for screen. If all
you&rsquo;ve got is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal
screen will <br>
be content to use it, but updating a character put into the
last position on the screen may not be possible until the
screen scrolls or the character is moved into a safe
posi&acirc; <br>
tion in some other way. This delay can be shortened by using
a terminal with insert-character capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
Screen has the following command-line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a include all capabilities
(with some minor exceptions) in each window&rsquo;s termcap,
even if screen must redraw parts of the display in order to
implement a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Adapt the sizes of all
windows to the size of the current terminal. By default,
screen tries to restore its old window sizes when attaching
to resizable terminals (those <br>
with &quot;WS&quot; in its description, e.g. suncmd or some
xterm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
override the default configuration file from
&quot;$HOME/.screenrc&quot; to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|-D [pid.tty.host] <br>
does not start screen, but detaches the elsewhere running
screen session. It has the same effect as typing &quot;C-a
d&quot; from screen&rsquo;s controlling terminal. -D is the
equivalent <br>
to the power detach key. If no session can be detached, this
option is ignored. In combination with the -r/-R option more
powerful effects can be achieved:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d -r Reattach a session and if
necessary detach it first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d -R Reattach a session and if
necessary detach or even create it first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d -RR Reattach a session and if
necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more
than one session is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D -r Reattach a session. If
necessary detach and logout remotely first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D -R Attach here and now. In
detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach.
If necessary detach and logout remotely first. If it was not
running create it and <br>
notify the user. This is the author&rsquo;s favorite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D -RR Attach here and now.
Whatever that means, just do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It is always a good idea
to check the status of your sessions by means of
&quot;screen -list&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e xy <br>
specifies the command character to be x and the character
generating a literal command character to y (when typed
after the command character). The default is &quot;C-a&quot;
and <br>
&lsquo;a&rsquo;, which can be specified as
&quot;-e^Aa&quot;. When creating a screen session, this
option sets the default command character. In a multiuser
session all users added will start <br>
off with this command character. But when attaching to an
already running session, this option changes only the
command character of the attaching user. This option is <br>
equivalent to either the commands &quot;defescape&quot; or
&quot;escape&quot; respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -fn, and -fa <br>
turns flow-control on, off, or &quot;automatic switching
mode&quot;. This can also be defined through the
&quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h num <br>
Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be num lines
high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i will cause the interrupt key
(usually C-c) to interrupt the display immediately when
flow-control is on. See the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc
command for details. The use of this <br>
option is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l and -ln <br>
turns login mode on or off (for /etc/utmp updating). This
can also be defined through the &quot;deflogin&quot;
.screenrc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls [match] <br>
-list [match] <br>
does not start screen, but prints a list of pid.tty.host
strings identifying your screen sessions. Sessions marked
&lsquo;detached&rsquo; can be resumed with &quot;screen
-r&quot;. Those marked <br>
&lsquo;attached&rsquo; are running and have a controlling
terminal. If the session runs in multiuser mode, it is
marked &lsquo;multi&rsquo;. Sessions marked as
&lsquo;unreachable&rsquo; either live on a dif&acirc; <br>
ferent host or are &lsquo;dead&rsquo;. An unreachable
session is considered dead, when its name matches either the
name of the local host, or the specified parameter, if any.
See the <br>
-r flag for a description how to construct matches. Sessions
marked as &lsquo;dead&rsquo; should be thoroughly checked
and removed. Ask your system administrator if you are not
sure. <br>
Remove sessions with the -wipe option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L tells screen to turn on
automatic output logging for the windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m causes screen to ignore the
$STY environment variable. With &quot;screen -m&quot;
creation of a new session is enforced, regardless whether
screen is called from within another screen <br>
session or not. This flag has a special meaning in
connection with the &lsquo;-d&rsquo; option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d -m Start screen in
&quot;detached&quot; mode. This creates a new session but
doesn&rsquo;t attach to it. This is useful for system
startup scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D -m This also starts screen in
&quot;detached&quot; mode, but doesn&rsquo;t fork a new
process. The command exits if the session terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O selects a more optimal output
mode for your terminal rather than true VT100 emulation
(only affects auto-margin terminals without
&lsquo;LP&rsquo;). This can also be set in your <br>
.screenrc by specifying &lsquo;OP&rsquo; in a
&quot;termcap&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p number_or_name|-|=|+ <br>
Preselect a window. This is useful when you want to reattach
to a specific window or you want to send a command via the
&quot;-X&quot; option to a specific window. As with
screen&rsquo;s <br>
select command, &quot;-&quot; selects the blank window. As a
special case for reattach, &quot;=&quot; brings up the
windowlist on the blank window, while a &quot;+&quot; will
create a new window. The <br>
command will not be executed if the specified window could
not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress printing of error
messages. In combination with &quot;-ls&quot; the exit value
is as follows: 9 indicates a directory without sessions. 10
indicates a directory with running <br>
but not attachable sessions. 11 (or more) indicates 1 (or
more) usable sessions. In combination with &quot;-r&quot;
the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates that there is no
ses&acirc; <br>
sion to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that there are 2 (or
more) sessions to resume and you should specify which one to
choose. In all other cases &quot;-q&quot; has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Some commands now can be
queried from a remote session using this flag, e.g.
&rsquo;screen -Q windows&rsquo;. The commands will send the
response to the stdout of the querying process. <br>
If there was an error in the command, then the querying
process will exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands that can be queried
now are: <br>
echo <br>
info <br>
lastmsg <br>
number <br>
select <br>
time <br>
title <br>
windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r [pid.tty.host] <br>
-r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host] <br>
resumes a detached screen session. No other options (except
combinations with -d/-D) may be specified, though an
optional prefix of [pid.]tty.host may be needed to
distin&acirc; <br>
guish between multiple detached screen sessions. The second
form is used to connect to another user&rsquo;s screen
session which runs in multiuser mode. This indicates that
<br>
screen should look for sessions in another user&rsquo;s
directory. This requires setuid-root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R attempts to resume the first
detached screen session it finds. If successful, all other
command-line options are ignored. If no detached session
exists, starts a new ses&acirc; <br>
sion using the specified options, just as if -R had not been
specified. The option is set by default if screen is run as
a login-shell (actually screen uses &quot;-xRR&quot; in that
<br>
case). For combinations with the -d/-D option see there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s program <br>
sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of
the value in the environment variable $SHELL (or
&quot;/bin/sh&quot; if not defined). This can also be
defined through the <br>
&quot;shell&quot; .screenrc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S sessionname <br>
When creating a new session, this option can be used to
specify a meaningful name for the session. This name
identifies the session for &quot;screen -list&quot; and
&quot;screen -r&quot; <br>
actions. It substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t name <br>
sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified
program. See also the &quot;shelltitle&quot; .screenrc
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T term <br>
Set the $TERM enviroment varible using the spcified term as
opposed to the defualt setting of screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Run screen in UTF-8 mode.
This option tells screen that your terminal sends and
understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets the
default encoding for new windows to <br>
&lsquo;utf8&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wipe [match] <br>
does the same as &quot;screen -ls&quot;, but removes
destroyed sessions instead of marking them as
&lsquo;dead&rsquo;. An unreachable session is considered
dead, when its name matches either the <br>
name of the local host, or the explicitly given parameter,
if any. See the -r flag for a description how to construct
matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Attach to a not detached
screen session. (Multi display mode). Screen refuses to
attach from within itself. But when cascading multiple
screens, loops are not detected; <br>
take care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Send the specified command to
a running screen session. You can use the -d or -r option to
tell screen to look only for attached or detached screen
sessions. Note that this <br>
command doesn&rsquo;t work if the session is password
protected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Resolve hostnames only to
IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Resolve hostnames only to
IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS <br>
As mentioned, each screen command consists of a
&quot;C-a&quot; followed by one other character. For your
convenience, all commands that are bound to lower-case
letters are also bound to <br>
their control character counterparts (with the exception of
&quot;C-a a&quot;; see below), thus, &quot;C-a c&quot; as
well as &quot;C-a C-c&quot; can be used to create a window.
See section &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot; <br>
for a description of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following table shows the
default key bindings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-a &rsquo; (select) Prompt for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMIZATION <br>
The &quot;socket directory&quot; defaults either to
$HOME/.screen or simply to /tmp/screens or preferably to
/usr/local/screens chosen at compile-time. If screen is
installed setuid-root, <br>
then the administrator should compile screen with an
adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If screen is
not running setuid-root, the user can specify any mode 700
direc&acirc; <br>
tory in the environment variable $SCREENDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When screen is invoked, it
executes initialization commands from the files
&quot;/etc/screenrc&quot; and &quot;.screenrc&quot; in the
user&rsquo;s home directory. These are the
&quot;programmer&rsquo;s defaults&quot; <br>
that can be overridden in the following ways: for the global
screenrc file screen searches for the environment variable
$SYSSCREENRC (this override feature may be disabled at <br>
compile-time). The user specific screenrc file is searched
in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc. The command line option
-c takes precedence over the above user screenrc files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands in these files are used
to set options, bind functions to keys, and to automatically
establish one or more windows at the beginning of your
screen session. Commands are <br>
listed one per line, with empty lines being ignored. A
command&rsquo;s arguments are separated by tabs or spaces,
and may be surrounded by single or double quotes. A
&lsquo;#&rsquo; turns the <br>
rest of the line into a comment, except in quotes.
Unintelligible lines are warned about and ignored. Commands
may contain references to environment variables. The syntax
is <br>
the shell-like &quot;$VAR &quot; or &quot;${VAR}&quot;. Note
that this causes incompatibility with previous screen
versions, as now the &rsquo;$&rsquo;-character has to be
protected with &rsquo;&acute; if no variable sub&acirc; <br>
stitution shall be performed. A string in single-quotes is
also protected from variable substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two configuration files are
shipped as examples with your screen distribution:
&quot;etc/screenrc&quot; and &quot;etc/etcscreenrc&quot;.
They contain a number of useful examples for various
com&acirc; <br>
mands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customization can also be done
&rsquo;on-line&rsquo;. To enter the command mode type
&lsquo;C-a :&rsquo;. Note that commands starting with
&quot;def&quot; change default values, while others change
current set&acirc; <br>
tings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acladd usernames [crypted-pw]
<br>
addacl usernames</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable users to fully access
this screen session. Usernames can be one user or a comma
separated list of users. This command enables to attach to
the screen session and performs <br>
the equivalent of &lsquo;aclchg usernames +rwx
&quot;#?&quot;&rsquo;. executed. To add a user with
restricted access, use the &lsquo;aclchg&rsquo; command
below. If an optional second parameter is supplied, it <br>
should be a crypted password for the named user(s).
&lsquo;Addacl&rsquo; is a synonym to &lsquo;acladd&rsquo;.
Multi user mode only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aclchg usernames permbits list
<br>
chacl usernames permbits list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change permissions for a comma
separated list of users. Permission bits are represented as
&lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;w&rsquo; and &lsquo;x&rsquo;.
Prefixing &lsquo;+&rsquo; grants the permission,
&lsquo;-&rsquo; removes it. The third param&acirc; <br>
eter is a comma separated list of commands and/or windows
(specified either by number or title). The special list
&lsquo;#&rsquo; refers to all windows, &lsquo;?&rsquo; to
all commands. if usernames <br>
consists of a single &lsquo;*&rsquo;, all known users are
affected. A command can be executed when the user has the
&lsquo;x&rsquo; bit for it. The user can type input to a
window when he has its &lsquo;w&rsquo; <br>
bit set and no other user obtains a writelock for this
window. Other bits are currently ignored. To withdraw the
writelock from another user in window 2: &lsquo;aclchg
username -w+w <br>
2&rsquo;. To allow read-only access to the session:
&lsquo;aclchg username -w &quot;#&quot;&rsquo;. As soon as a
user&rsquo;s name is known to screen he can attach to the
session and (per default) has full per&acirc; <br>
missions for all command and windows. Execution permission
for the acl commands, &lsquo;at&rsquo; and others should
also be removed or the user may be able to regain write
permission. <br>
Rights of the special username nobody cannot be changed (see
the &quot;su&quot; command). &lsquo;Chacl&rsquo; is a
synonym to &lsquo;aclchg&rsquo;. Multi user mode only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acldel username</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove a user from
screen&rsquo;s access control list. If currently attached,
all the user&rsquo;s displays are detached from the session.
He cannot attach again. Multi user mode only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aclgrp username [groupname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates groups of users that
share common access rights. The name of the group is the
username of the group leader. Each member of the group
inherits the permissions that are <br>
granted to the group leader. That means, if a user fails an
access check, another check is made for the group leader. A
user is removed from all groups the special value
&quot;none&quot; <br>
is used for groupname. If the second parameter is omitted
all groups the user is in are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aclumask [[users]+bits
|[users]-bits .... ] <br>
umask [[users]+bits |[users]-bits .... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the access other
users have to windows that will be created by the caller of
the command. Users may be no, one or a comma separated list
of known usernames. If no <br>
users are specified, a list of all currently known users is
assumed. Bits is any combination of access control bits
allowed defined with the &quot;aclchg&quot; command. The
special user&acirc; <br>
name &quot;?&quot; predefines the access that not yet known
users will be granted to any window initially. The special
username &quot;??&quot; predefines the access that not yet
known users are <br>
granted to any command. Rights of the special username
nobody cannot be changed (see the &quot;su&quot; command).
&lsquo;Umask&rsquo; is a synonym to
&lsquo;aclumask&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">activity message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When any activity occurs in a
background window that is being monitored, screen displays a
notification in the message line. The notification message
can be re-defined by means <br>
of the &quot;activity&quot; command. Each occurrence of
&lsquo;%&rsquo; in message is replaced by the number of the
window in which activity has occurred, and each occurrence
of &lsquo;^G&rsquo; is replaced by <br>
the definition for bell in your termcap (usually an audible
bell). The default message is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;Activity in window
%n&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that monitoring is off for
all windows by default, but can be altered by use of the
&quot;monitor&quot; command (C-a M).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allpartial on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to on, only the current
cursor line is refreshed on window change. This affects all
windows and is useful for slow terminal lines. The previous
setting of full/partial <br>
refresh for each window is restored with &quot;allpartial
off&quot;. This is a global flag that immediately takes
effect on all windows overriding the &quot;partial&quot;
settings. It does not <br>
change the default redraw behavior of newly created
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">altscreen on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to on, &quot;alternate
screen&quot; support is enabled in virtual terminals, just
like in xterm. Initial setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at [identifier][#|*|%] command
[args ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute a command at other
displays or windows as if it had been entered there.
&quot;At&quot; changes the context (the &lsquo;current
window&rsquo; or &lsquo;current display&rsquo; setting) of
the command. If <br>
the first parameter describes a non-unique context, the
command will be executed multiple times. If the first
parameter is of the form &lsquo;identifier*&rsquo; then
identifier is matched <br>
against user names. The command is executed once for each
display of the selected user(s). If the first parameter is
of the form &lsquo;identifier%&rsquo; identifier is matched
against dis&acirc; <br>
plays. Displays are named after the ttys they attach. The
prefix &lsquo;/dev/&rsquo; or &lsquo;/dev/tty&rsquo; may be
omitted from the identifier. If identifier has a
&lsquo;#&rsquo; or nothing appended it is <br>
matched against window numbers and titles. Omitting an
identifier in front of the &lsquo;#&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;
or &lsquo;%&rsquo;-character selects all users, displays or
windows because a prefix-match is per&acirc; <br>
formed. Note that on the affected display(s) a short message
will describe what happened. Permission is checked for
initiator of the &quot;at&quot; command, not for the owners
of the <br>
affected display(s). Note that the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character
works as a comment introducer when it is preceded by
whitespace. This can be escaped by prefixing a
&rsquo;&acute;. Permission is checked <br>
for the initiator of the &quot;at&quot; command, not for the
owners of the affected display(s). <br>
Caveat: When matching against windows, the command is
executed at least once per window. Commands that change the
internal arrangement of windows (like &quot;other&quot;) may
be called <br>
again. In shared windows the command will be repeated for
each attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle commands
like &quot;login&quot;! Some commands (e.g.
&quot;process&quot;) require that a <br>
display is associated with the target windows. These
commands may not work correctly under &quot;at&quot; looping
over windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrcolor attrib
[attribute/color-modifier]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command can be used to
highlight attributes by changing the color of the text. If
the attribute attrib is in use, the specified
attribute/color modifier is also applied. If <br>
no modifier is given, the current one is deleted. See the
&quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter for the syntax of the
modifier. Screen understands two pseudo-attributes,
&quot;i&quot; stands for high- <br>
intensity foreground color and &quot;I&quot; for
high-intensity background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrcolor b &quot;R&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the color to bright red
if bold text is to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrcolor u &quot;-u b&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use blue text instead of
underline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrcolor b &quot;.I&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use bright colors for bold text.
Most terminal emulators do this already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrcolor i &quot;+b&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make bright colored text also
bold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autodetach on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets whether screen will
automatically detach upon hangup, which saves all your
running programs until they are resumed with a screen -r
command. When turned off, a hangup sig&acirc; <br>
nal will terminate screen and all the processes it contains.
Autodetach is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autonuke on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets whether a clear screen
sequence should nuke all the output that has not been
written to the terminal. See also &quot;obuflimit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backtick id lifespan autorefresh
cmd args... <br>
backtick id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program the backtick command
with the numerical id id. The output of such a command is
used for substitution of the &quot;%&lsquo;&quot; string
escape. The specified lifespan is the number of <br>
seconds the output is considered valid. After this time, the
command is run again if a corresponding string escape is
encountered. The autorefresh parameter triggers an
auto&acirc; <br>
matic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings after the
specified number of seconds. Only the last line of output is
used for substitution. <br>
If both the lifespan and the autorefresh parameters are
zero, the backtick program is expected to stay in the
background and generate output once in a while. In this
case, the <br>
command is executed right away and screen stores the last
line of output. If a new line gets printed screen will
automatically refresh the hardstatus or the captions. <br>
The second form of the command deletes the backtick command
with the numerical id id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bce [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change background-color-erase
setting. If &quot;bce&quot; is set to on, all characters
cleared by an erase/insert/scroll/clear operation will be
displayed in the current background color. <br>
Otherwise the default background color is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell_msg [message]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a bell character is sent to
a background window, screen displays a notification in the
message line. The notification message can be re-defined by
this command. Each <br>
occurrence of &lsquo;%&rsquo; in message is replaced by the
number of the window to which a bell has been sent, and each
occurrence of &lsquo;^G&rsquo; is replaced by the definition
for bell in your <br>
termcap (usually an audible bell). The default message
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;Bell in window
%n&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty message can be supplied
to the &quot;bell_msg&quot; command to suppress output of a
message line (bell_msg &quot;&quot;). Without parameter, the
current message is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind [-c class] key [command
[args]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bind a command to a key. By
default, most of the commands provided by screen are bound
to one or more keys as indicated in the &quot;DEFAULT KEY
BINDINGS&quot; section, e.g. the command <br>
to create a new window is bound to &quot;C-c&quot; and
&quot;c&quot;. The &quot;bind&quot; command can be used to
redefine the key bindings and to define new bindings. The
key argument is either a single <br>
character, a two-character sequence of the form
&quot;^x&quot; (meaning &quot;C-x&quot;), a backslash
followed by an octal number (specifying the ASCII code of
the character), or a backslash fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by a second character, such as &quot;&quot; or
&quot;\&quot;. The argument can also be quoted, if you like.
If no further argument is given, any previously established
binding for this <br>
key is removed. The command argument can be any command
listed in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command class is specified
via the &quot;-c&quot; option, the key is bound for the
specified class. Use the &quot;command&quot; command to
activate a class. Command classes can be used to cre&acirc;
<br>
ate multiple command keys or multi-character bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind &rsquo; &rsquo; windows
<br>
bind ^k <br>
bind k <br>
bind K kill <br>
bind ^f screen telnet foobar <br>
bind 33 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would bind the space key to the
command that displays a list of windows (so that the command
usually invoked by &quot;C-a C-w&quot; would also be
available as &quot;C-a space&quot;). The next three <br>
lines remove the default kill binding from &quot;C-a
C-k&quot; and &quot;C-a k&quot;. &quot;C-a K&quot; is then
bound to the kill command. Then it binds &quot;C-f&quot; to
the command &quot;create a window with a TELNET <br>
connection to foobar&quot;, and bind &quot;escape&quot; to
the command that creates an non-login window with a.k.a.
&quot;root&quot; in slot #9, with a superuser shell and a
scrollback buffer of 1000 <br>
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind -c demo1 0 select 10 <br>
bind -c demo1 1 select 11 <br>
bind -c demo1 2 select 12 <br>
bindkey &quot;^B&quot; command -c demo1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makes &quot;C-b 0&quot; select
window 10, &quot;C-b 1&quot; window 11, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind -c demo2 0 select 10 <br>
bind -c demo2 1 select 11 <br>
bind -c demo2 2 select 12 <br>
bind - command -c demo2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makes &quot;C-a - 0&quot; select
window 10, &quot;C-a - 1&quot; window 11, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey [-d] [-m] [-a] [[-k|-t]
string [cmd args]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command manages
screen&rsquo;s input translation tables. Every entry in one
of the tables tells screen how to react if a certain
sequence of characters is encountered. There are <br>
three tables: one that should contain actions programmed by
the user, one for the default actions used for terminal
emulation and one for screen&rsquo;s copy mode to do cursor
move&acirc; <br>
ment. See section &quot;INPUT TRANSLATION&quot; for a list
of default key bindings. <br>
If the -d option is given, bindkey modifies the default
table, -m changes the copy mode table and with neither
option the user table is selected. The argument string is
the <br>
sequence of characters to which an action is bound. This can
either be a fixed string or a termcap keyboard capability
name (selectable with the -k option). <br>
Some keys on a VT100 terminal can send a different string if
application mode is turned on (e.g the cursor keys). Such
keys have two entries in the translation table. You can <br>
select the application mode entry by specifying the -a
option. <br>
The -t option tells screen not to do inter-character timing.
One cannot turn off the timing if a termcap capability is
used. <br>
Cmd can be any of screen&rsquo;s commands with an arbitrary
number of args. If cmd is omitted the key-binding is removed
from the table. <br>
Here are some examples of keyboard bindings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey -d <br>
Show all of the default key bindings. The application mode
entries are marked with [A].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey -k k1 select 1 <br>
Make the &quot;F1&quot; key switch to window one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo <br>
Make &quot;foo&quot; an abbreviation of the word
&quot;barfoo&quot;. Timeout is disabled so that users can
type slowly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey &quot; 24&quot;
mapdefault <br>
This key-binding makes &quot;^T&quot; an escape character
for key-bindings. If you did the above &quot;stuff
barfoo&quot; binding, you can enter the word &quot;foo&quot;
by typing &quot;^Tfoo&quot;. If you want to <br>
insert a &quot;^T&quot; you have to press the key twice
(i.e., escape the escape binding).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey -k F1 command <br>
Make the F11 (not F1!) key an alternative screen escape
(besides ^A).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break [duration]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send a break signal for
duration*0.25 seconds to this window. For non-Posix systems
the time interval may be rounded up to full seconds. Most
useful if a character device is <br>
attached to the window rather than a shell process (See also
chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;). The maximum duration of a
break signal is limited to 15 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blanker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Activate the screen blanker.
First the screen is cleared. If no blanker program is
defined, the cursor is turned off, otherwise, the program is
started and it&rsquo;s output is written <br>
to the screen. The screen blanker is killed with the first
keypress, the read key is discarded. <br>
This command is normally used together with the
&quot;idle&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blankerprg [program args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines a blanker program.
Disables the blanker program if an empty argument is given.
Shows the currently set blanker program if no arguments are
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">breaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK
|TCSBRK]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose one of the available
methods of generating a break signal for terminal devices.
This command should affect the current window only. But it
still behaves identical to <br>
&quot;defbreaktype&quot;. This will be changed in the
future. Calling &quot;breaktype&quot; with no parameter
displays the break method for the current window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bufferfile [exchange-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the filename used for
reading and writing with the paste buffer. If the optional
argument to the &quot;bufferfile&quot; command is omitted,
the default setting (&quot;/tmp/screen- <br>
exchange&quot;) is reactivated. The following example will
paste the system&rsquo;s password file into the screen
window (using the paste buffer, where a copy remains):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-a : bufferfile /etc/passwd
<br>
C-a &lt; C-a ] <br>
C-a : bufferfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c1 [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change c1 code processing.
&quot;C1 on&quot; tells screen to treat the input characters
between 128 and 159 as control functions. Such an 8-bit code
is normally the same as ESC followed <br>
by the corresponding 7-bit code. The default setting is to
process c1 codes and can be changed with the
&quot;defc1&quot; command. Users with fonts that have usable
characters in the c1 <br>
positions may want to turn this off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caption always|splitonly
[string] <br>
caption string [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command controls the
display of the window captions. Normally a caption is only
used if more than one window is shown on the display (split
screen mode). But if the type is <br>
set to always screen shows a caption even if only one window
is displayed. The default is splitonly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form changes the text
used for the caption. You can use all escapes from the
&quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses a default of
&lsquo;%3n %t&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can mix both forms by
providing a string as an additional argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charset set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the current character set
slot designation and charset mapping. The first four
character of set are treated as charset designators while
the fifth and sixth character <br>
must be in range &rsquo;0&rsquo; to &rsquo;3&rsquo; and set
the GL/GR charset mapping. On every position a
&rsquo;.&rsquo; may be used to indicate that the
corresponding charset/mapping should not be changed (set
<br>
is padded to six characters internally by appending
&rsquo;.&rsquo; chars). New windows have &quot;BBBB02&quot;
as default charset, unless a &quot;encoding&quot; command is
active. <br>
The current setting can be viewed with the &quot;info&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir [directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the current directory of
screen to the specified directory or, if called without an
argument, to your home directory (the value of the
environment variable $HOME). All <br>
windows that are created by means of the &quot;screen&quot;
command from within &quot;.screenrc&quot; or by means of
&quot;C-a : screen ...&quot; or &quot;C-a c&quot; use this
as their default directory. Without a <br>
chdir command, this would be the directory from which screen
was invoked. Hardcopy and log files are always written to
the window&rsquo;s default directory, not the current
directory <br>
of the process running in the window. You can use this
command multiple times in your .screenrc to start various
windows in different default directories, but the last chdir
<br>
value will affect all the windows you create
interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clears the current window and
saves its image to the scrollback buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colon [prefix]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to enter
&quot;.screenrc&quot; command lines. Useful for on-the-fly
modification of key bindings, specific window creation and
changing settings. Note that the &quot;set&quot; keyword no
<br>
longer exists! Usually commands affect the current window
rather than default settings for future windows. Change
defaults with commands starting with
&rsquo;def...&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you consider this as the
&lsquo;Ex command mode&rsquo; of screen, you may regard
&quot;C-a esc&quot; (copy mode) as its &lsquo;Vi command
mode&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [-c class]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command has the same effect
as typing the screen escape character (^A). It is probably
only useful for key bindings. If the &quot;-c&quot; option
is given, select the specified com&acirc; <br>
mand class. See also &quot;bind&quot; and
&quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compacthist [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells screen whether to
suppress trailing blank lines when scrolling up text into
the history buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">console [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grabs or un-grabs the machines
console output to a window. Note: Only the owner of
/dev/console can grab the console output. This command is
only available if the machine sup&acirc; <br>
ports the ioctl TIOCCONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter copy/scrollback mode. This
allows you to copy text from the current window and its
history into the paste buffer. In this mode a vi-like
&lsquo;full screen editor&rsquo; is active: <br>
Movement keys: <br>
h, C-h, or left arrow move the cursor left. <br>
j, C-n, or down arrow move the cursor down. <br>
k, C-p, or up arrow move the cursor up. <br>
l (&rsquo;el&rsquo;) or right arrow move the cursor right.
<br>
0 (zero) or C-a move to the leftmost column. <br>
+ and - positions one line up and down. <br>
H, M and L move the cursor to the leftmost column of the
top, center or bottom line of the window. <br>
| moves to the specified absolute column. <br>
g or home moves to the beginning of the buffer. <br>
G or end moves to the specified absolute line (default: end
of buffer). <br>
% jumps to the specified percentage of the buffer. <br>
^ or $ move to the leftmost column, to the first or last
non-whitespace character on the line. <br>
w, b, and e move the cursor word by word. <br>
B, E move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi). <br>
f/F, t/T move the cursor forward/backward to the next
occurence of the target. (eg, &rsquo;3fy&rsquo; will move
the cursor to the 3rd &rsquo;y&rsquo; to the right.) <br>
; and , Repeat the last f/F/t/T command in the same/opposite
direction. <br>
C-e and C-y scroll the display up/down by one line while
preserving the cursor position. <br>
C-u and C-d scroll the display up/down by the specified
amount of lines while preserving the cursor position.
(Default: half screen-full). <br>
C-b and C-f scroll the display up/down a full screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: <br>
Emacs style movement keys can be customized by a .screenrc
command. (E.g. markkeys &quot;h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot;) There is
no simple method for a full emacs-style keymap, as this <br>
involves multi-character codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Marking: <br>
The copy range is specified by setting two marks. The text
between these marks will be highlighted. Press: <br>
space or enter to set the first or second mark respectively.
If mousetrack is set to &lsquo;on&rsquo;, marks can also be
set using left mouse click. <br>
Y and y used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of
line. <br>
W marks exactly one word. <br>
Repeat count: <br>
Any of these commands can be prefixed with a repeat count
number by pressing digits <br>
0..9 which is taken as a repeat count. <br>
Example: &quot;C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y&quot; will copy lines 11
to 15 into the paste buffer. <br>
Searching: <br>
/ Vi-like search forward. <br>
? Vi-like search backward. <br>
C-a s Emacs style incremental search forward. <br>
C-r Emacs style reverse i-search. <br>
n Find next search pattern. <br>
N Find previous search pattern. <br>
Specials: <br>
There are however some keys that act differently than in vi.
Vi does not allow one to yank rectangular blocks of text,
but screen does. Press: <br>
c or C to set the left or right margin respectively. If no
repeat count is given, both default to the current cursor
position. <br>
Example: Try this on a rather full text screen: &quot;C-a [
M 20 l SPACE c 10 l 5 j C SPACE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This moves one to the middle
line of the screen, moves in 20 columns left, marks the
beginning of the paste buffer, sets the left column, moves 5
columns down, sets the right <br>
column, and then marks the end of the paste buffer. Now try:
<br>
&quot;C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and notice the difference in the
amount of text copied. <br>
J joins lines. It toggles between 4 modes: lines separated
by a newline character (012), lines glued seamless, lines
separated by a single whitespace and comma separated lines.
<br>
Note that you can prepend the newline character with a
carriage return character, by issuing a &quot;crlf on&quot;.
<br>
v or V is for all the vi users with &quot;:set numbers&quot;
- it toggles the left margin between column 9 and 1. Press
<br>
a before the final space key to toggle in append mode. Thus
the contents of the paste buffer will not be overwritten,
but is appended to. <br>
A toggles in append mode and sets a (second) mark. <br>
&gt; sets the (second) mark and writes the contents of the
paste buffer to the screen-exchange file
(/tmp/screen-exchange per default) once copy-mode is
finished. <br>
This example demonstrates how to dump the whole scrollback
buffer to that file: &quot;C-A [ g SPACE G $ &gt;&quot;.
<br>
C-g gives information about the current line and column.
<br>
x or o exchanges the first mark and the current cursor
position. You can use this to adjust an already placed mark.
<br>
C-l (&rsquo;el&rsquo;) will redraw the screen. <br>
@ does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode. <br>
All keys not described here exit copy mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy_reg [key]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No longer exists, use
&quot;readreg&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crlf [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This affects the copying of text
regions with the &lsquo;C-a [&rsquo; command. If it is set
to &lsquo;on&rsquo;, lines will be separated by the two
character sequence &lsquo;CR&rsquo; - &lsquo;LF&rsquo;.
Otherwise (default) <br>
only &lsquo;LF&rsquo; is used. When no parameter is given,
the state is toggled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns runtime debugging on or
off. If screen has been compiled with option -DDEBUG
debugging available and is turned on per default. Note that
this command only affects debugging <br>
output from the main &quot;SCREEN&quot; process correctly.
Debug output from attacher processes can only be turned off
once and forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defc1 on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the c1 command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial
setting is &lsquo;on&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defautonuke on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the autonuke command
except that the default setting for new displays is changed.
Initial setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;. Note that you can use
the special &lsquo;AN&rsquo; terminal capability if <br>
you want to have a dependency on the terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defbce on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the bce command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial
setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defbreaktype
[tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK |TCSBRK]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose one of the available
methods of generating a break signal for terminal devices.
The preferred methods are tcsendbreak and TIOCSBRK. The
third, TCSBRK, blocks the complete <br>
screen session for the duration of the break, but it may be
the only way to generate long breaks. Tcsendbreak and
TIOCSBRK may or may not produce long breaks with spikes
(e.g. 4 <br>
per second). This is not only system-dependent, this also
differs between serial board drivers. Calling
&quot;defbreaktype&quot; with no parameter displays the
current setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defcharset [set]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the charset command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Shows
current default if called without argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defescape xy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the default command
characters. This is equivalent to the &quot;escape&quot;
except that it is useful multiuser sessions only. In a
multiuser session &quot;escape&quot; changes the command
char&acirc; <br>
acter of the calling user, where &quot;defescape&quot;
changes the default command characters for users that will
be added later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defflow on|off|auto
[interrupt]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the flow command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial
setting is &lsquo;auto&rsquo;. Specifying &quot;defflow auto
interrupt&quot; is the same as the command- <br>
line options -fa and -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defgr on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the gr command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial
setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defhstatus [status]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardstatus line that all new
windows will get is set to status. This command is useful to
make the hardstatus of every window display the window
number or title or the like. <br>
Status may contain the same directives as in the window
messages, but the directive escape character is
&rsquo;^E&rsquo; (octal 005) instead of &rsquo;%&rsquo;.
This was done to make a misinterpreta&acirc; <br>
tion of program generated hardstatus lines impossible. If
the parameter status is omitted, the current default string
is displayed. Per default the hardstatus line of new
win&acirc; <br>
dows is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defencoding enc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the encoding command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initial setting is the encoding taken from the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deflog on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the log command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial
setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deflogin on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the login command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. This is
initialized with &lsquo;on&rsquo; as distributed (see
config.h.in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defmode mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode of each newly allocated
pseudo-tty is set to mode. Mode is an octal number. When no
&quot;defmode&quot; command is given, mode 0622 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defmonitor on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the monitor command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initial setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defmousetrack on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the mousetrack command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initial setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defnonblock on|off|numsecs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the nonblock command
except that the default setting for displays is changed.
Initial setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defobuflimit limit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the obuflimit command
except that the default setting for new displays is changed.
Initial setting is 256 bytes. Note that you can use the
special &rsquo;OL&rsquo; terminal capabil&acirc; <br>
ity if you want to have a dependency on the terminal
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defscrollback num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the scrollback command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initial setting is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defshell command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synonym to the shell command.
See there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defsilence on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the silence command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initial setting is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defslowpaste msec&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the slowpaste command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initial setting is 0 milliseconds, meaning
&lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defutf8 on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the utf8 command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed. Initial
setting is &lsquo;on&rsquo; if screen was started with
&quot;-U&quot;, otherwise &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defwrap on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the wrap command except
that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initially line-wrap is on and can be toggled with the
&quot;wrap&quot; command (&quot;C-a r&quot;) or by means of
<br>
&quot;C-a : wrap on|off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defwritelock on|off|auto</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as the writelock command
except that the default setting for new windows is changed.
Initially writelocks will off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defzombie [keys]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synonym to the zombie command.
Both currently change the default. See there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detach [-h]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detach the screen session
(disconnect it from the terminal and put it into the
background). This returns you to the shell where you invoked
screen. A detached screen can be <br>
resumed by invoking screen with the -r option (see also
section &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot;). The -h option
tells screen to immediately close the connection to the
terminal <br>
(&quot;hangup&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dinfo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show what screen thinks about
your terminal. Useful if you want to know why features like
color or the alternate charset don&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">displays</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shows a tabular listing of all
currently connected user front-ends (displays). This is most
useful for multiuser sessions. The following keys can be
used in displays list: <br>
k, C-p, or up Move up one line. <br>
j, C-n, or down Move down one line. <br>
C-a or home Move to the first line. <br>
C-e or end Move to the last line. <br>
C-u or C-d Move one half page up or down. <br>
C-b or C-f Move one full page up or down. <br>
mouseclick Move to the selected line. Available when
&quot;mousetrack&quot; is set to on. <br>
space Refresh the list <br>
d Detach that display <br>
D Power detach that display <br>
C-g, enter, or escape Exit the list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is an example of
what &quot;displays&quot; could look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm 80x42 jnweiger@/dev/ttyp4
0(m11) &amp;rWx <br>
facit 80x24 mlschroe@/dev/ttyhf nb 11(tcsh) rwx <br>
xterm 80x42 jnhollma@/dev/ttyp5 0(m11) &amp;R.x <br>
(A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F)(G) (H)(I)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The legend is as follows: <br>
(A) The terminal type known by screen for this display. <br>
(B) Displays geometry as width x height. <br>
(C) Username who is logged in at the display. <br>
(D) Device name of the display or the attached device <br>
(E) Display is in blocking or nonblocking mode. The
available modes are &quot;nb&quot;, &quot;NB&quot;,
&quot;Z&lt;&quot;, &quot;Z&gt;&quot;, and &quot;BL&quot;.
<br>
(F) Number of the window <br>
(G) Name/title of window <br>
(H) Whether the window is shared <br>
(I) Window permissions. Made up of three characters: <br>
(1st character) <br>
&acirc;-&acirc; : no read <br>
&acirc;r&acirc; : read <br>
&acirc;R&acirc; : read only due to foreign wlock <br>
(2nd character) <br>
&acirc;-&acirc; : no write <br>
&acirc;.&acirc; : write suppressed by foreign wlock <br>
&acirc;w&acirc; : write <br>
&acirc;W&acirc; : own wlock <br>
(3rd character) <br>
&acirc;-&acirc; : no execute <br>
&acirc;x&acirc; : execute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Displays&quot; needs a
region size of at least 10 characters wide and 5 characters
high in order to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">digraph
[preset[unicode-value]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command prompts the user
for a digraph sequence. The next two characters typed are
looked up in a builtin table and the resulting character is
inserted in the input stream. <br>
For example, if the user enters &rsquo;a&quot;&rsquo;, an
a-umlaut will be inserted. If the first character entered is
a 0 (zero), screen will treat the following characters (up
to three) as an <br>
octal number instead. The optional argument preset is
treated as user input, thus one can create an
&quot;umlaut&quot; key. For example the command
&quot;bindkey ^K digraph &rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;&quot; enables
the <br>
user to generate an a-umlaut by typing CTRL-K a. When a
non-zero unicode-value is specified, a new digraph is
created with the specified preset. The digraph is unset if a
zero <br>
value is provided for the unicode-value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumptermcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write the termcap entry for the
virtual terminal optimized for the currently active window
to the file &quot;.termcap&quot; in the user&rsquo;s
&quot;$HOME/.screen&quot; directory (or wherever screen <br>
stores its sockets. See the &quot;FILES&quot; section
below). This termcap entry is identical to the value of the
environment variable $TERMCAP that is set up by screen for
each window. <br>
For terminfo based systems you will need to run a converter
like captoinfo and then compile the entry with tic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo [-n] message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The echo command may be used to
annoy screen users with a &rsquo;message of the day&rsquo;.
Typically installed in a global /etc/screenrc. The option
&quot;-n&quot; may be used to suppress the line <br>
feed. See also &quot;sleep&quot;. Echo is also useful for
online checking of environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding enc [enc]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell screen how to interpret the
input/output. The first argument sets the encoding of the
current window. Each window can emulate a different
encoding. The optional second <br>
parameter overwrites the encoding of the connected terminal.
It should never be needed as screen uses the locale setting
to detect the encoding. There is also a way to select a <br>
terminal encoding depending on the terminal type by using
the &quot;KJ&quot; termcap entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported encodings are eucJP,
SJIS, eucKR, eucCN, Big5, GBK, KOI8-R, CP1251, UTF-8,
ISO8859-2, ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4, ISO8859-5, ISO8859-6,
ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9, <br>
ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;defencoding&quot;, which changes the default setting
of a new window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape xy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the command character to x
and the character generating a literal command character (by
triggering the &quot;meta&quot; command) to y (similar to
the -e option). Each argument is <br>
either a single character, a two-character sequence of the
form &quot;^x&quot; (meaning &quot;C-x&quot;), a backslash
followed by an octal number (specifying the ASCII code of
the character), or a <br>
backslash followed by a second character, such as
&quot;&quot; or &quot;\&quot;. The default is
&quot;^Aa&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval command1 [command2 ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parses and executes each
argument as separate command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args
...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run a unix subprocess (specified
by an executable path newcommand and its optional arguments)
in the current window. The flow of data between newcommands
stdin/stdout/stderr, the <br>
process originally started in the window (let us call it
&quot;application-process&quot;) and screen itself (window)
is controlled by the file descriptor pattern fdpat. This
pattern is <br>
basically a three character sequence representing stdin,
stdout and stderr of newcommand. A dot (.) connects the file
descriptor to screen. An exclamation mark (!) causes the
<br>
file descriptor to be connected to the application-process.
A colon (:) combines both. User input will go to newcommand
unless newcommand receives the application-process&rsquo;
out&acirc; <br>
put (fdpats first character is &lsquo;!&rsquo; or
&lsquo;:&rsquo;) or a pipe symbol (|) is added (as a fourth
character) to the end of fdpat. <br>
Invoking &lsquo;exec&rsquo; without arguments shows name and
arguments of the currently running subprocess in this
window. Only one subprocess a time can be running in each
window. <br>
When a subprocess is running the &lsquo;kill&rsquo; command
will affect it instead of the windows process. <br>
Refer to the postscript file &lsquo;doc/fdpat.ps&rsquo; for
a confusing illustration of all 21 possible combinations.
Each drawing shows the digits 2,1,0 representing the three
file descrip&acirc; <br>
tors of newcommand. The box marked &lsquo;W&rsquo; is the
usual pty that has the application-process on its slave
side. The box marked &lsquo;P&rsquo; is the secondary pty
that now has screen at its <br>
master side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Abbreviations: <br>
Whitespace between the word &lsquo;exec&rsquo; and fdpat and
the command can be omitted. Trailing dots and a fdpat
consisting only of dots can be omitted. A simple
&lsquo;|&rsquo; is synonymous for the <br>
pattern &lsquo;!..|&rsquo;; the word exec can be omitted
here and can always be replaced by &lsquo;!&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec ... /bin/sh <br>
exec /bin/sh <br>
!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates another shell in the
same window, while the original shell is still running.
Output of both shells is displayed and user input is sent to
the new /bin/sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec !.. stty 19200 <br>
exec ! stty 19200 <br>
!!stty 19200</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the speed of the
window&rsquo;s tty. If your stty command operates on stdout,
then add another &lsquo;!&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec !..| less <br>
|less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This adds a pager to the window
output. The special character &lsquo;|&rsquo; is needed to
give the user control over the pager although it gets its
input from the window&rsquo;s process. This <br>
works, because less listens on stderr (a behavior that
screen would not expect without the &lsquo;|&rsquo;) when
its stdin is not a tty. Less versions newer than 177 fail
miserably here; <br>
good old pg still works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!:sed -n s/.*Error.*/ 07/p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sends window output to both, the
user and the sed command. The sed inserts an additional bell
character (oct. 007) to the window output seen by screen.
This will cause &quot;Bell in <br>
window x&quot; messages, whenever the string
&quot;Error&quot; appears in the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the window size to the
size of the current region. This command is needed because
screen doesn&rsquo;t adapt the window size automatically if
the window is displayed more than <br>
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow [on|off|auto]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the flow-control mode for
this window. Without parameters it cycles the current
window&rsquo;s flow-control setting from
&quot;automatic&quot; to &quot;on&quot; to &quot;off&quot;.
See the discussion on <br>
&quot;FLOW-CONTROL&quot; later on in this document for full
details and note, that this is subject to change in future
releases. Default is set by &lsquo;defflow&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focus [up|down|top|bottom]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move the input focus to the next
region. This is done in a cyclic way so that the top region
is selected after the bottom one. If no subcommand is given
it defaults to &lsquo;down&rsquo;. <br>
&lsquo;up&rsquo; cycles in the opposite order,
&lsquo;top&rsquo; and &lsquo;bottom&rsquo; go to the top and
bottom region respectively. Useful bindings are (j and k as
in vi) <br>
bind j focus down <br>
bind k focus up <br>
bind t focus top <br>
bind b focus bottom <br>
Note that k is traditionally bound to the kill command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focusminsize [ ( width|max|_ ) (
height|max|_ ) ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This forces any currently
selected region to be automatically resized at least a
certain width and height. All other surrounding regions will
be resized in order to accommodate. <br>
This constraint follows everytime the &quot;focus&quot;
command is used. The &quot;resize&quot; command can be used
to increase either dimension of a region, but never below
what is set with &quot;focus&acirc; <br>
minsize&quot;. The underscore &lsquo;_&rsquo; is a synonym
for max. Setting a width and height of &lsquo;0 0&rsquo;
(zero zero) will undo any constraints and allow for manual
resizing. Without any parame&acirc; <br>
ters, the minimum width and height is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gr [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turn GR charset switching
on/off. Whenever screen sees an input character with the 8th
bit set, it will use the charset stored in the GR slot and
print the character with the 8th <br>
bit stripped. The default (see also &quot;defgr&quot;) is
not to process GR switching because otherwise the ISO88591
charset would not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group [grouptitle]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change or show the group the
current window belongs to. Windows can be moved around
between different groups by specifying the name of the
destination group. Without specifying a <br>
group, the title of the current group is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardcopy [-h] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writes out the currently
displayed image to the file file, or, if no filename is
specified, to hardcopy.n in the default directory, where n
is the number of the current window. <br>
This either appends or overwrites the file if it exists. See
below. If the option -h is specified, dump also the contents
of the scrollback buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardcopy_append on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to &quot;on&quot;, screen
will append to the &quot;hardcopy.n&quot; files created by
the command &quot;C-a h&quot;, otherwise these files are
overwritten each time. Default is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardcopydir directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines a directory where
hardcopy files will be placed. If unset, hardcopys are
dumped in screen&rsquo;s current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardstatus [on|off] <br>
hardstatus [always]lastline|message|ignore [string] <br>
hardstatus string [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command configures the use
and emulation of the terminal&rsquo;s hardstatus line. The
first form toggles whether screen will use the hardware
status line to display messages. If <br>
the flag is set to &lsquo;off&rsquo;, these messages are
overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The
default setting is &lsquo;on&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form tells screen
what to do if the terminal doesn&rsquo;t have a hardstatus
line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo capabilities &quot;hs&quot;,
&quot;ts&quot;, &quot;fs&quot; and &quot;ds&quot; are not
set). If the type <br>
&quot;lastline&quot; is used, screen will reserve the last
line of the display for the hardstatus. &quot;message&quot;
uses screen&rsquo;s message mechanism and &quot;ignore&quot;
tells screen never to display the <br>
hardstatus. If you prepend the word &quot;always&quot; to
the type (e.g., &quot;alwayslastline&quot;), screen will use
the type even if the terminal supports a hardstatus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form specifies the
contents of the hardstatus line. &rsquo;%h&rsquo; is used as
default string, i.e., the stored hardstatus of the current
window (settable via &quot;ESC]0;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot; <br>
or &quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC <br>
the current string is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can mix the second and third
form by providing the string as additional argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">height [-w|-d] [lines
[cols]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the display height to a
specified number of lines. When no argument is given it
toggles between 24 and 42 lines display. You can also
specify a width if you want to change <br>
both values. The -w option tells screen to leave the display
size unchanged and just set the window size, -d vice
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [-c class]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not really a online help, but
displays a help screen showing you all the key bindings. The
first pages list all the internal commands followed by their
current bindings. Subse&acirc; <br>
quent pages will display the custom commands, one command
per key. Press space when you&rsquo;re done reading each
page, or return to exit early. All other characters are
ignored. If <br>
the &quot;-c&quot; option is given, display all bound
commands for the specified command class. See also
&quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually users work with a shell
that allows easy access to previous commands. For example
csh has the command &quot;!!&quot; to repeat the last
command executed. Screen allows you to <br>
have a primitive way of re-calling &quot;the command that
started ...&quot;: You just type the first letter of that
command, then hit &lsquo;C-a {&rsquo; and screen tries to
find a previous line that <br>
matches with the &lsquo;prompt character&rsquo; to the left
of the cursor. This line is pasted into this window&rsquo;s
input queue. Thus you have a crude command history (made up
by the visible <br>
window and its scrollback buffer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hstatus status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the window&rsquo;s
hardstatus line to the string status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle [timeout [cmd args]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets a command that is run after
the specified number of seconds inactivity is reached. This
command will normally be the &quot;blanker&quot; command to
create a screen blanker, but it can <br>
be any screen command. If no command is specified, only the
timeout is set. A timeout of zero (or the special timeout
off) disables the timer. If no arguments are given, the <br>
current settings are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignorecase [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell screen to ignore the case
of characters in searches. Default is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.
Without any options, the state of ignorecase is toggled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uses the message line to display
some information about the current window: the cursor
position in the form &quot;(column,row)&quot; starting with
&quot;(1,1)&quot;, the terminal width and height <br>
plus the size of the scrollback buffer in lines, like in
&quot;(80,24)+50&quot;, the current state of window XON/XOFF
flow control is shown like this (See also section FLOW
CONTROL):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+flow automatic flow control,
currently on. <br>
-flow automatic flow control, currently off. <br>
+(+)flow flow control enabled. Agrees with automatic
control. <br>
-(+)flow flow control disabled. Disagrees with automatic
control. <br>
+(-)flow flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic
control. <br>
-(-)flow flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current line wrap setting
(&lsquo;+wrap&rsquo; indicates enabled, &lsquo;-wrap&rsquo;
not) is also shown. The flags &lsquo;ins&rsquo;,
&lsquo;org&rsquo;, &lsquo;app&rsquo;, &lsquo;log&rsquo;,
&lsquo;mon&rsquo; or &lsquo;nored&rsquo; are displayed when
the window is in <br>
insert mode, origin mode, application-keypad mode, has
output logging, activity monitoring or partial redraw
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The currently active character
set (G0, G1, G2, or G3) and in square brackets the terminal
character sets that are currently designated as G0 through
G3 is shown. If the window <br>
is in UTF-8 mode, the string &quot;UTF-8&quot; is shown
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional modes depending on
the type of the window are displayed at the end of the
status line (See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;).
<br>
If the state machine of the terminal emulator is in a
non-default state, the info line is started with a string
identifying the current state. <br>
For system information use the &quot;time&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ins_reg [key]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No longer exists, use
&quot;paste&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill current window. <br>
If there is an &lsquo;exec&rsquo; command running then it is
killed. Otherwise the process (shell) running in the window
receives a HANGUP condition, the window structure is removed
and <br>
screen (your display) switches to another window. When the
last window is destroyed, screen exits. After a kill screen
switches to the previously displayed window. <br>
Note: Emacs users should keep this command in mind, when
killing a line. It is recommended not to use &quot;C-a&quot;
as the screen escape key or to rebind kill to &quot;C-a
K&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lastmsg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redisplay the last contents of
the message/status line. Useful if you&rsquo;re typing when
a message appears, because the message goes away when you
press a key (unless your terminal <br>
has a hardware status line). Refer to the commands
&quot;msgwait&quot; and &quot;msgminwait&quot; for fine
tuning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout new [title]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a new layout. The screen
will change to one whole region and be switched to the blank
window. From here, you build the regions and the windows
they show as you desire. The <br>
new layout will be numbered with the smallest available
integer, starting with zero. You can optionally give a title
to your new layout. Otherwise, it will have a default title
<br>
of &quot;layout&quot;. You can always change the title later
by using the command layout title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout remove [n|title]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove, or in other words,
delete the specified layout. Either the number or the title
can be specified. Without either specification, screen will
remove the current layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removing a layout does not
affect your set windows or regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch to the next layout
available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout prev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch to the previous layout
available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout select [n|title]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the desired layout.
Either the number or the title can be specified. Without
either specification, screen will prompt and ask which
screen is desired. To see which layouts <br>
are available, use the layout show command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout show</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List on the message line the
number(s) and title(s) of the available layout(s). The
current layout is flagged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout title [title]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change or display the title of
the current layout. A string given will be used to name the
layout. Without any options, the current title and number is
displayed on the message <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout number [n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change or display the number of
the current layout. An integer given will be used to number
the layout. Without any options, the current number and
title is displayed on the mes&acirc; <br>
sage line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout attach [title|:last]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change or display which layout
to reattach back to. The default is :last, which tells
screen to reattach back to the last used layout just before
detachment. By supplying a <br>
title, You can instruct screen to reattach to a particular
layout regardless which one was used at the time of
detachment. Without any options, the layout to reattach to
will be <br>
shown in the message line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout save [n|title]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember the current arrangement
of regions. When used, screen will remember the arrangement
of vertically and horizontally split regions. This
arrangement is restored when a <br>
screen session is reattached or switched back from a
different layout. If the session ends or the screen process
dies, the layout arrangements are lost. The layout dump
command <br>
should help in this siutation. If a number or title is
supplied, screen will remember the arrangement of that
particular layout. Without any options, screen will remember
the <br>
current layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Saving your regions can be done
automatically by using the layout autosave command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout autosave [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change or display the status of
automatcally saving layouts. The default is on, meaning when
screen is detached or changed to a different layout, the
arrangement of regions and <br>
windows will be remembered at the time of change and
restored upon return. If autosave is set to off, that
arrangement will only be restored to either to the last
manual save, <br>
using layout save, or to when the layout was first created,
to a single region with a single window. Without either an
on or off, the current status is displayed on the message
<br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layout dump [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write to a file the order of
splits made in the current layout. This is useful to
recreate the order of your regions used in your current
layout. Only the current layout is <br>
recorded. While the order of the regions are recorded, the
sizes of those regions and which windows correspond to which
regions are not. If no filename is specified, the default
<br>
is layout-dump, saved in the directory that the screen
process was started in. If the file already exists, layout
dump will append to that file. As an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-a : layout dump
/home/user/.screenrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will save or append the layout
to the user&rsquo;s .screenrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">license</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display the disclaimer page.
This is done whenever screen is started without options,
which should be often enough. See also the
&quot;startup_message&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lockscreen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lock this display. Call a
screenlock program (/local/bin/lck or /usr/bin/lock or a
builtin if no other is available). Screen does not accept
any command keys until this program <br>
terminates. Meanwhile processes in the windows may continue,
as the windows are in the &lsquo;detached&rsquo; state. The
screenlock program may be changed through the environment
variable <br>
$LOCKPRG (which must be set in the shell from which screen
is started) and is executed with the user&rsquo;s uid and
gid. <br>
Warning: When you leave other shells unlocked and you have
no password set on screen, the lock is void: One could
easily re-attach from an unlocked shell. This feature should
<br>
rather be called &lsquo;lockterminal&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start/stop writing output of the
current window to a file &quot;screenlog.n&quot; in the
window&rsquo;s default directory, where n is the number of
the current window. This filename can be <br>
changed with the &lsquo;logfile&rsquo; command. If no
parameter is given, the state of logging is toggled. The
session log is appended to the previous contents of the file
if it already <br>
exists. The current contents and the contents of the
scrollback history are not included in the session log.
Default is &lsquo;off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logfile filename <br>
logfile flush secs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines the name the log files
will get. The default is &quot;screenlog.%n&quot;. The
second form changes the number of seconds screen will wait
before flushing the logfile buffer to the <br>
file-system. The default value is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds or removes the entry in the
utmp database file for the current window. This controls if
the window is &lsquo;logged in&rsquo;. When no parameter is
given, the login state of the win&acirc; <br>
dow is toggled. Additionally to that toggle, it is
convenient having a &lsquo;log in&rsquo; and a &lsquo;log
out&rsquo; key. E.g. &lsquo;bind I login on&rsquo; and
&lsquo;bind O login off&rsquo; will map these keys to be C-a
<br>
I and C-a O. The default setting (in config.h.in) should be
&quot;on&quot; for a screen that runs under suid-root. Use
the &quot;deflogin&quot; command to change the default login
state for new <br>
windows. Both commands are only present when screen has been
compiled with utmp support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logtstamp [on|off] <br>
logtstamp after [secs] <br>
logtstamp string [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command controls logfile
time-stamp mechanism of screen. If time-stamps are turned
&quot;on&quot;, screen adds a string containing the current
time to the logfile after two minutes <br>
of inactivity. When output continues and more than another
two minutes have passed, a second time-stamp is added to
document the restart of the output. You can change this
time&acirc; <br>
out with the second form of the command. The third form is
used for customizing the time-stamp string (&lsquo;-- %n:%t
-- time-stamp -- %M/%d/%y %c:%s --0 by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapdefault</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell screen that the next input
character should only be looked up in the default bindkey
table. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mapnotnext</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like mapdefault, but don&rsquo;t
even look in the default bindkey table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maptimeout [timeout]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the inter-character timer
for input sequence detection to a timeout of timeout ms. The
default timeout is 300ms. Maptimeout with no arguments shows
the current setting. See <br>
also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">markkeys string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a method of changing the
keymap used for copy/history mode. The string is made up of
oldchar=newchar pairs which are separated by
&lsquo;:&rsquo;. Example: The string &quot;B=^B:F=^F&quot;
<br>
will change the keys &lsquo;C-b&rsquo; and &lsquo;C-f&rsquo;
to the vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page). This
happens to be the default binding for &lsquo;B&rsquo; and
&lsquo;F&rsquo;. The command &quot;markkeys <br>
h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot; would set the mode for an emacs-style
binding. If your terminal sends characters, that cause you
to abort copy mode, then this command may help by binding
these <br>
characters to do nothing. The no-op character is
&lsquo;@&rsquo; and is used like this: &quot;markkeys
@=L=H&quot; if you do not want to use the &lsquo;H&rsquo; or
&lsquo;L&rsquo; commands any longer. As shown in this <br>
example, multiple keys can be assigned to one function in a
single statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxwin num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the maximum window number
screen will create. Doesn&rsquo;t affect already existing
windows. The number can be increased only when there are no
existing windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">meta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert the command character
(C-a) in the current window&rsquo;s input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Toggles activity monitoring of
windows. When monitoring is turned on and an affected window
is switched into the background, you will receive the
activity notification message <br>
in the status line at the first sign of output and the
window will also be marked with an &lsquo;@&rsquo; in the
window-status display. Monitoring is initially off for all
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mousetrack [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command determines whether
screen will watch for mouse clicks. When this command is
enabled, regions that have been split in various ways can be
selected by pointing to them <br>
with a mouse and left-clicking them. Without specifying on
or off, the current state is displayed. The default state is
determined by the &quot;defmousetrack&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msgminwait sec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines the time screen delays a
new message when one message is currently displayed. The
default is 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msgwait sec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines the time a message is
displayed if screen is not disturbed by other activity. The
default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multiuser on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch between singleuser and
multiuser mode. Standard screen operation is singleuser. In
multiuser mode the commands &lsquo;acladd&rsquo;,
&lsquo;aclchg&rsquo;, &lsquo;aclgrp&rsquo; and
&lsquo;acldel&rsquo; can be used to <br>
enable (and disable) other users accessing this screen
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nethack on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the kind of error
messages used by screen. When you are familiar with the game
&quot;nethack&quot;, you may enjoy the nethack-style
messages which will often blur the facts a lit&acirc; <br>
tle, but are much funnier to read. Anyway, standard messages
often tend to be unclear as well. <br>
This option is only available if screen was compiled with
the NETHACK flag defined. The default setting is then
determined by the presence of the environment variable
$NETHACKOP&acirc; <br>
TIONS and the file ~/.nethackrc - if either one is present,
the default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch to the next window. This
command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nonblock [on|off|numsecs]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell screen how to deal with
user interfaces (displays) that cease to accept output. This
can happen if a user presses ^S or a TCP/modem connection
gets cut but no hangup is <br>
received. If nonblock is off (this is the default) screen
waits until the display restarts to accept the output. If
nonblock is on, screen waits until the timeout is reached
(on <br>
is treated as 1s). If the display still doesn&rsquo;t
receive characters, screen will consider it
&quot;blocked&quot; and stop sending characters to it. If at
some time it restarts to accept <br>
characters, screen will unblock the display and redisplay
the updated window contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number [[+|-]n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the current
window&rsquo;s number. If the given number n is already used
by another window, both windows exchange their numbers. If
no argument is specified, the current window <br>
number (and title) is shown. Using &lsquo;+&rsquo; or
&lsquo;-&rsquo; will change the window&rsquo;s number by the
relative amount specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obuflimit [limit]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output buffer contains
more bytes than the specified limit, no more data will be
read from the windows. The default value is 256. If you have
a fast display (like xterm), <br>
you can set it to some higher value. If no argument is
specified, the current setting is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill all regions but the current
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch to the window displayed
previously. If this window does no longer exist, other has
the same effect as next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">partial on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines whether the display
should be refreshed (as with redisplay) after switching to
the current window. This command only affects the current
window. To immediately affect <br>
all windows use the allpartial command. Default is
&lsquo;off&rsquo;, of course. This default is fixed, as
there is currently no defpartial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password [crypted_pw]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Present a crypted password in
your &quot;.screenrc&quot; file and screen will ask for it,
whenever someone attempts to resume a detached. This is
useful if you have privileged programs <br>
running under screen and you want to protect your session
from reattach attempts by another user masquerading as your
uid (i.e. any superuser.) If no crypted password is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, screen prompts twice for typing a password and places
its encryption in the paste buffer. Default is
&lsquo;none&rsquo;, this disables password checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paste [registers [dest_reg]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write the (concatenated)
contents of the specified registers to the stdin queue of
the current window. The register &rsquo;.&rsquo; is treated
as the paste buffer. If no parameter is given <br>
the user is prompted for a single register to paste. The
paste buffer can be filled with the copy, history and
readbuf commands. Other registers can be filled with the
regis&acirc; <br>
ter, readreg and paste commands. If paste is called with a
second argument, the contents of the specified registers is
pasted into the named destination register rather than the
<br>
window. If &rsquo;.&rsquo; is used as the second argument,
the displays paste buffer is the destination. Note, that
&quot;paste&quot; uses a wide variety of resources: Whenever
a second argument is <br>
specified no current window is needed. When the source
specification only contains registers (not the paste buffer)
then there need not be a current display (terminal
attached), <br>
as the registers are a global resource. The paste buffer
exists once for every user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pastefont [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tell screen to include font
information in the paste buffer. The default is not to do
so. This command is especially useful for multi character
fonts like kanji.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pow_break</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reopen the window&rsquo;s
terminal line and send a break condition. See
&lsquo;break&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pow_detach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Power detach. Mainly the same as
detach, but also sends a HANGUP signal to the parent process
of screen. CAUTION: This will result in a logout, when
screen was started from <br>
your login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pow_detach_msg [message]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message specified here is
output whenever a &lsquo;Power detach&rsquo; was performed.
It may be used as a replacement for a logout message or to
reset baud rate, etc. Without parameter, <br>
the current message is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch to the window with the
next lower number. This command can be used repeatedly to
cycle through the list of windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printcmd [cmd]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If cmd is not an empty string,
screen will not use the terminal capabilities
&quot;po/pf&quot; if it detects an ansi print sequence ESC [
5 i, but pipe the output into cmd. This should <br>
normally be a command like &quot;lpr&quot; or
&quot;&rsquo;cat &gt; /tmp/scrprint&rsquo;&quot;. printcmd
without a command displays the current setting. The ansi
sequence ESC &nbsp;ends printing and closes the pipe. <br>
Warning: Be careful with this command! If other user have
write access to your terminal, they will be able to fire off
print commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">process [key]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stuff the contents of the
specified register into screen&rsquo;s input queue. If no
argument is given you are prompted for a register name. The
text is parsed as if it had been typed <br>
in from the user&rsquo;s keyboard. This command can be used
to bind multiple actions to a single key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill all windows and terminate
screen. Note that on VT100-style terminals the keys C-4 and
C-&nbsp;are identical. This makes the default bindings
dangerous: Be careful not to type <br>
C-a C-4 when selecting window no. 4. Use the empty bind
command (as in &quot;bind &rsquo;^&acute;&quot;) to remove a
key binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readbuf [-e encoding]
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reads the contents of the
specified file into the paste buffer. You can tell screen
the encoding of the file via the -e option. If no file is
specified, the screen-exchange <br>
filename is used. See also &quot;bufferfile&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readreg [-e encoding] [register
[filename]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Does one of two things,
dependent on number of arguments: with zero or one arguments
it it duplicates the paste buffer contents into the register
specified or entered at the <br>
prompt. With two arguments it reads the contents of the
named file into the register, just as readbuf reads the
screen-exchange file into the paste buffer. You can tell
screen <br>
the encoding of the file via the -e option. The following
example will paste the system&rsquo;s password file into the
screen window (using register p, where a copy remains):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-a : readreg p /etc/passwd <br>
C-a : paste p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redisplay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redisplay the current window.
Needed to get a full redisplay when in partial redraw
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register [-e encoding] key
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save the specified string to the
register key. The encoding of the string can be specified
via the -e option. See also the &quot;paste&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill the current region. This is
a no-op if there is only one region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removebuf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlinks the screen-exchange file
used by the commands &quot;writebuf&quot; and
&quot;readbuf&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rendition bell | monitor |
silence | so attr [color]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the way screen renders
the titles of windows that have monitor or bell flags set in
caption or hardstatus or windowlist. See the &quot;STRING
ESCAPES&quot; chapter for the syntax of <br>
the modifiers. The default for monitor is currently &quot;=b
&quot; (bold, active colors), for bell &quot;=ub &quot;
(underline, bold and active colors), and &quot;=u &quot; for
silence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset the virtual terminal to
its &quot;power-on&quot; values. Useful when strange
settings (like scroll regions or graphics character set) are
left over from an application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize the current region. The
space will be removed from or added to the region below or
if there&rsquo;s not enough space from the region above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize +N increase current
region height by N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize -N decrease current
region height by N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize N set current region
height to N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize = make all windows
equally high</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize max maximize current
region height</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize min minimize current
region height</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen [-opts] [n] [cmd
[args]|//group]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Establish a new window. The
flow-control options (-f, -fn and -fa), title (a.k.a.)
option (-t), login options (-l and -ln) , terminal type
option (-T &lt;term&gt;), the all-capabil&acirc; <br>
ity-flag (-a) and scrollback option (-h &lt;num&gt;) may be
specified with each command. The option (-M) turns
monitoring on for this window. The option (-L) turns output
logging on <br>
for this window. If an optional number n in the range
0..MAXWIN-1 is given, the window number n is assigned to the
newly created window (or, if this number is already in-use,
<br>
the next available number). If a command is specified after
&quot;screen&quot;, this command (with the given arguments)
is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created. If
<br>
//group is supplied, a container-type window is created in
which other windows may be created inside it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, if your
&quot;.screenrc&quot; contains the lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># example for .screenrc: <br>
screen 1 <br>
screen -fn -t foobar -L 2 telnet foobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen creates a shell window
(in window #1) and a window with a TELNET connection to the
machine foobar (with no flow-control using the title
&quot;foobar&quot; in window #2) and will <br>
write a logfile (&quot;screenlog.2&quot;) of the telnet
session. Note, that unlike previous versions of screen no
additional default window is created when &quot;screen&quot;
commands are included <br>
in your &quot;.screenrc&quot; file. When the initialization
is completed, screen switches to the last window specified
in your .screenrc file or, if none, opens a default window
#0. <br>
Screen has built in some functionality of &quot;cu&quot; and
&quot;telnet&quot;. See also chapter &quot;WINDOW
TYPES&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollback num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the size of the scrollback
buffer for the current windows to num lines. The default
scrollback is 100 lines. See also the
&quot;defscrollback&quot; command and use &quot;info&quot;
to view the <br>
current setting. To access and use the contents in the
scrollback buffer, use the &quot;copy&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select [WindowID]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch to the window identified
by WindowID. This can be a prefix of a window title
(alphanumeric window name) or a window number. The parameter
is optional and if omitted, you <br>
get prompted for an identifier. When a new window is
established, the first available number is assigned to this
window. Thus, the first window can be activated by
&quot;select 0&quot;. <br>
The number of windows is limited at compile-time by the
MAXWIN configuration parameter (which defaults to 40). There
are two special WindowIDs, &quot;-&quot; selects the
internal blank <br>
window and &quot;.&quot; selects the current window. The
latter is useful if used with screen&rsquo;s &quot;-X&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sessionname [name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename the current session.
Note, that for &quot;screen -list&quot; the name shows up
with the process-id prepended. If the argument
&quot;name&quot; is omitted, the name of this session is
dis&acirc; <br>
played. Caution: The $STY environment variables will still
reflect the old name in pre-existing shells. This may result
in confusion. Use of this command is generally
discour&acirc; <br>
aged. Use the &quot;-S&quot; command-line option if you want
to name a new session. The default is constructed from the
tty and host names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv [var [string]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the environment variable var
to value string. If only var is specified, the user will be
prompted to enter a value. If no parameters are specified,
the user will be <br>
prompted for both variable and value. The environment is
inherited by all subsequently forked shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setsid [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally screen uses different
sessions and process groups for the windows. If setsid is
turned off, this is not done anymore and all windows will be
in the same process group as <br>
the screen backend process. This also breaks job-control, so
be careful. The default is on, of course. This command is
probably useful only in rare circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the command to be used to
create a new shell. This overrides the value of the
environment variable $SHELL. This is useful if you&rsquo;d
like to run a tty-enhancer which is <br>
expecting to execute the program specified in $SHELL. If the
command begins with a &rsquo;-&rsquo; character, the shell
will be started as a login-shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shelltitle title</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the title for all shells
created during startup or by the C-A C-c command. For
details about what a title is, see the discussion entitled
&quot;TITLES (naming windows)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silence [on|off|sec]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Toggles silence monitoring of
windows. When silence is turned on and an affected window is
switched into the background, you will receive the silence
notification message in the <br>
status line after a specified period of inactivity
(silence). The default timeout can be changed with the
&lsquo;silencewait&rsquo; command or by specifying a number
of seconds instead of <br>
&lsquo;on&rsquo; or &lsquo;off&rsquo;. Silence is initially
off for all windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">silencewait sec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define the time that all windows
monitored for silence should wait before displaying a
message. Default 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sleep num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will pause the
execution of a .screenrc file for num seconds. Keyboard
activity will end the sleep. It may be used to give users a
chance to read the messages out&acirc; <br>
put by &quot;echo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slowpaste msec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define the speed at which text
is inserted into the current window by the paste (&quot;C-a
]&quot;) command. If the slowpaste value is nonzero text is
written character by character. <br>
screen will make a pause of msec milliseconds after each
single character write to allow the application to process
its input. Only use slowpaste if your underlying system <br>
exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read and execute commands from
file file. Source commands may be nested to a maximum
recursion level of ten. If file is not an absolute path and
screen is already processing a <br>
source command, the parent directory of the running source
command file is used to search for the new command file
before screen&rsquo;s current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that
termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at startup
and reattach time, so they must be reached via the default
screenrc files to have an effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sorendition [attr [color]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is deprecated. See
&quot;rendition so&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Split the current region into
two new ones. All regions on the display are resized to make
room for the new region. The blank window is displayed on
the new region. Splits are <br>
made horizontally unless -v is used. Use the
&quot;remove&quot; or the &quot;only&quot; command to delete
regions. Use &quot;focus&quot; to toggle between
regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startup_message on|off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select whether you want to see
the copyright notice during startup. Default is
&lsquo;on&rsquo;, as you probably noticed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stuff [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stuff the string string in the
input buffer of the current window. This is like the
&quot;paste&quot; command but with much less overhead.
Without a paramter, screen will prompt for a <br>
string to stuff. You cannot paste large buffers with the
&quot;stuff&quot; command. It is most useful for key
bindings. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su [username [password
[password2]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Substitute the user of a
display. The command prompts for all parameters that are
omitted. If passwords are specified as parameters, they have
to be specified un-crypted. The <br>
first password is matched against the systems passwd
database, the second password is matched against the screen
password as set with the commands &quot;acladd&quot; or
&quot;password&quot;. &quot;Su&quot; <br>
may be useful for the screen administrator to test multiuser
setups. When the identification fails, the user has access
to the commands available for user nobody. These are <br>
&quot;detach&quot;, &quot;license&quot;,
&quot;version&quot;, &quot;help&quot; and
&quot;displays&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suspend screen. The windows are
in the &lsquo;detached&rsquo; state, while screen is
suspended. This feature relies on the shell being able to do
job control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term term</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In each window&rsquo;s
environment screen opens, the $TERM variable is set to
&quot;screen&quot; by default. But when no description for
&quot;screen&quot; is installed in the local termcap or
terminfo <br>
data base, you set $TERM to - say - &quot;vt100&quot;. This
won&rsquo;t do much harm, as screen is VT100/ANSI
compatible. The use of the &quot;term&quot; command is
discouraged for non-default purpose. <br>
That is, one may want to specify special $TERM settings
(e.g. vt100) for the next &quot;screen rlogin
othermachine&quot; command. Use the command &quot;screen -T
vt100 rlogin othermachine&quot; <br>
rather than setting and resetting the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap term terminal-tweaks
[window-tweaks] <br>
terminfo term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks] <br>
termcapinfo term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this command to modify your
terminal&rsquo;s termcap entry without going through all the
hassles involved in creating a custom termcap entry. Plus,
you can optionally customize <br>
the termcap generated for the windows. You have to place
these commands in one of the screenrc startup files, as they
are meaningless once the terminal emulator is booted. <br>
If your system works uses the terminfo database rather than
termcap, screen will understand the &lsquo;terminfo&rsquo;
command, which has the same effects as the
&lsquo;termcap&rsquo; command. Two sep&acirc; <br>
arate commands are provided, as there are subtle syntactic
differences, e.g. when parameter interpolation (using
&lsquo;%&rsquo;) is required. Note that termcap names of the
capabilities <br>
have to be used with the &lsquo;terminfo&rsquo; command.
<br>
In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both
terminfo and termcap syntax, you can use the command
&lsquo;termcapinfo&rsquo;, which is just a shorthand for a
pair of &lsquo;termcap&rsquo; and <br>
&lsquo;terminfo&rsquo; commands with identical
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first argument specifies
which terminal(s) should be affected by this definition. You
can specify multiple terminal names by separating them with
&lsquo;|&rsquo;s. Use &lsquo;*&rsquo; to match all <br>
terminals and &lsquo;vt*&rsquo; to match all terminals that
begin with &quot;vt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each tweak argument contains one
or more termcap defines (separated by &lsquo;:&rsquo;s) to
be inserted at the start of the appropriate termcap entry,
enhancing it or overriding existing <br>
values. The first tweak modifies your terminal&rsquo;s
termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal uses to
perform certain functions. Specify a null string to leave
this <br>
unchanged (e.g. &rsquo;&rsquo;). The second (optional) tweak
modifies all the window termcaps, and should contain
definitions that screen understands (see the &quot;VIRTUAL
TERMINAL&quot; section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap xterm* LP:hs@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informs screen that all
terminals that begin with &lsquo;xterm&rsquo; have firm
auto-margins that allow the last position on the screen to
be updated (LP), but they don&rsquo;t really have a
sta&acirc; <br>
tus line (no &rsquo;hs&rsquo; - append &lsquo;@&rsquo; to
turn entries off). Note that we assume &lsquo;LP&rsquo; for
all terminal names that start with &quot;vt&quot;, but only
if you don&rsquo;t specify a termcap command for <br>
that terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap vt* LP <br>
termcap vt102|vt220 Z0=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the firm-margined
&lsquo;LP&rsquo; capability for all terminals that begin
with &lsquo;vt&rsquo;, and the second line will also add the
escape-sequences to switch into (Z0) and back out of <br>
(Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if this is a VT102 or
VT220. (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in your termcap to use
the width-changing commands.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap vt100 &quot;&quot;
l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This leaves your vt100 termcap
alone and adds the function key labels to each
window&rsquo;s termcap entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap h19|z19 am@:im=@:ei=
dc=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Takes a h19 or z19 termcap and
turns off auto-margins (am@) and enables the insert mode
(im) and end-insert (ei) capabilities (the &lsquo;@&rsquo;
in the &lsquo;im&rsquo; string is after the &lsquo;=&rsquo;,
so it <br>
is part of the string). Having the &lsquo;im&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ei&rsquo; definitions put into your terminal&rsquo;s
termcap will cause screen to automatically advertise the
character-insert capability in <br>
each window&rsquo;s termcap. Each window will also get the
delete-character capability (dc) added to its termcap, which
screen will translate into a line-update for the terminal
<br>
(we&rsquo;re pretending it doesn&rsquo;t support character
deletion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to fully
specify each window&rsquo;s termcap entry, you should
instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior to running screen.
See the discussion on the &quot;VIRTUAL TERMI&acirc; <br>
NAL&quot; in this manual, and the termcap(5) man page for
more information on termcap definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uses the message line to display
the time of day, the host name, and the load averages over
1, 5, and 15 minutes (if this is available on your system).
For window specific <br>
information, use &quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a string is specified, it
changes the format of the time report like it is described
in the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses a
default of &quot;%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title [windowtitle]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the name of the current
window to windowtitle. If no name is specified, screen
prompts for one. This command was known as &lsquo;aka&rsquo;
in previous releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbindall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbind all the bindings. This
can be useful when screen is used solely for its detaching
abilities, such as when letting a console application run as
a daemon. If, for some rea&acirc; <br>
son, it is necessary to bind commands after this, use
&rsquo;screen -X&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsetenv var</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unset an environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 [on|off [on|off]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the encoding used in the
current window. If utf8 is enabled, the strings sent to the
window will be UTF-8 encoded and vice versa. Omitting the
parameter toggles the set&acirc; <br>
ting. If a second parameter is given, the display&rsquo;s
encoding is also changed (this should rather be done with
screen&rsquo;s &quot;-U&quot; option). See also
&quot;defutf8&quot;, which changes the <br>
default setting of a new window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vbell [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the visual bell setting for
this window. Omitting the parameter toggles the setting. If
vbell is switched on, but your terminal does not support a
visual bell, a &lsquo;vbell-mes&acirc; <br>
sage&rsquo; is displayed in the status line when the bell
character (^G) is received. Visual bell support of a
terminal is defined by the termcap variable &lsquo;vb&rsquo;
(terminfo: &rsquo;flash&rsquo;). <br>
Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is used.
See also &lsquo;bell_msg&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vbell_msg [message]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the visual bell message.
message is printed to the status line if the window receives
a bell character (^G), vbell is set to &quot;on&quot;, but
the terminal does not support a visual <br>
bell. The default message is &quot;Wuff, Wuff!!&quot;.
Without a parameter, the current message is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vbellwait sec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define a delay in seconds after
each display of screen&rsquo;s visual bell message. The
default is 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If verbose is switched on, the
command name is echoed, whenever a window is created (or
resurrected from zombie state). Default is off. Without a
parameter, the current setting <br>
is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the current version and
the compile date in the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wall message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write a message to all displays.
The message will appear in the terminal&rsquo;s status
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">width [-w|-d] [cols [lines]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Toggle the window width between
80 and 132 columns or set it to cols columns if an argument
is specified. This requires a capable terminal and the
termcap entries &quot;Z0&quot; and &quot;Z1&quot;. <br>
See the &quot;termcap&quot; command for more information.
You can also specify a new height if you want to change both
values. The -w option tells screen to leave the display size
<br>
unchanged and just set the window size, -d vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windowlist [-b] [-m] [-g] <br>
windowlist string [string] <br>
windowlist title [title]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display all windows in a table
for visual window selection. If screen was in a window
group, screen will back out of the group and then display
the windows in that group. If <br>
the -b option is given, screen will switch to the blank
window before presenting the list, so that the current
window is also selectable. The -m option changes the order
of the <br>
windows, instead of sorting by window numbers screen uses
its internal most-recently-used list. The -g option will
show the windows inside any groups in that level and
down&acirc; <br>
wards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following keys are used to
navigate in &quot;windowlist&quot;: <br>
k, C-p, or up Move up one line. <br>
j, C-n, or down Move down one line. <br>
C-g or escape Exit windowlist. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table format can be changed
with the string and title option, the title is displayed as
table heading, while the lines are made by using the string
setting. The default set&acirc; <br>
ting is &quot;Num Name%=Flags&quot; for the title and

ESCAPES&quot; chapter for more codes (e.g. color
settings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Windowlist&quot; needs a
region size of at least 10 characters wide and 6 characters
high in order to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uses the message line to display
a list of all the windows. Each window is listed by number
with the name of process that has been started in the window
(or its title); the cur&acirc; <br>
rent window is marked with a &lsquo;*&rsquo;; the previous
window is marked with a &lsquo;-&rsquo;; all the windows
that are &quot;logged in&quot; are marked with a
&lsquo;$&rsquo;; a background window that has received a
<br>
bell is marked with a &lsquo;!&rsquo;; a background window
that is being monitored and has had activity occur is marked
with an &lsquo;@&rsquo;; a window which has output logging
turned on is marked <br>
with &lsquo;(L)&rsquo;; windows occupied by other users are
marked with &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;; windows in the zombie state
are marked with &lsquo;Z&rsquo;. If this list is too long to
fit on the terminal&rsquo;s status line <br>
only the portion around the current window is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrap [on|off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the line-wrap setting for
the current window. When line-wrap is on, the second
consecutive printable character output at the last column of
a line will wrap to the start of <br>
the following line. As an added feature, backspace (^H) will
also wrap through the left margin to the previous line.
Default is &lsquo;on&rsquo;. Without any options, the state
of wrap is <br>
toggled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writebuf [-e encoding]
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writes the contents of the paste
buffer to the specified file, or the public accessible
screen-exchange file if no filename is given. This is
thought of as a primitive means of <br>
communication between screen users on the same host. If an
encoding is specified the paste buffer is recoded on the fly
to match the encoding. The filename can be set with the <br>
bufferfile command and defaults to
&quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writelock [on|off|auto]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to access control
lists, not all users may be able to write to the same window
at once. Per default, writelock is in &lsquo;auto&rsquo;
mode and grants exclusive input permission <br>
to the user who is the first to switch to the particular
window. When he leaves the window, other users may obtain
the writelock (automatically). The writelock of the current
<br>
window is disabled by the command &quot;writelock off&quot;.
If the user issues the command &quot;writelock on&quot; he
keeps the exclusive write permission while switching to
other windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xoff <br>
xon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q
character to the stdin queue of the current window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmodem [off|auto|catch|pass]
<br>
zmodem sendcmd [string] <br>
zmodem recvcmd [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define zmodem support for
screen. Screen understands two different modes when it
detects a zmodem request: &quot;pass&quot; and
&quot;catch&quot;. If the mode is set to &quot;pass&quot;,
screen will relay <br>
all data to the attacher until the end of the transmission
is reached. In &quot;catch&quot; mode screen acts as a
zmodem endpoint and starts the corresponding rz/sz commands.
If the mode <br>
is set to &quot;auto&quot;, screen will use
&quot;catch&quot; if the window is a tty (e.g. a serial
line), otherwise it will use &quot;pass&quot;. <br>
You can define the templates screen uses in
&quot;catch&quot; mode via the second and the third form.
<br>
Note also that this is an experimental feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zombie [keys[onerror]] <br>
defzombie [keys]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per default screen windows are
removed from the window list as soon as the windows process
(e.g. shell) exits. When a string of two keys is specified
to the zombie command, <br>
&lsquo;dead&rsquo; windows will remain in the list. The kill
command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing the
first key in the dead window has the same effect. When
pressing the <br>
second key, screen will attempt to resurrect the window. The
process that was initially running in the window will be
launched again. Calling zombie without parameters will clear
<br>
the zombie setting, thus making windows disappear when their
process exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the zombie-setting is
manipulated globally for all windows, this command should
only be called defzombie. Until we need this as a per window
setting, the commands zombie and <br>
defzombie are synonymous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally you can put the word
&quot;onerror&quot; after the keys. This will cause screen
to monitor exit status of the process running in the window.
If it exits normally (&rsquo;0&rsquo;), the win&acirc; <br>
dow disappears. Any other exit value causes the window to
become a zombie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE MESSAGE LINE <br>
Screen displays informational messages and other diagnostics
in a message line. While this line is distributed to appear
at the bottom of the screen, it can be defined to appear
<br>
at the top of the screen during compilation. If your
terminal has a status line defined in its termcap, screen
will use this for displaying its messages, otherwise a line
of the <br>
current screen will be temporarily overwritten and output
will be momentarily interrupted. The message line is
automatically removed after a few seconds delay, but it can
also be <br>
removed early (on terminals without a status line) by
beginning to type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message line facility can be
used by an application running in the current window by
means of the ANSI Privacy message control sequence. For
instance, from within the shell, <br>
try something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &rsquo;&lt;esc&gt;^Hello
world from window
&rsquo;$WINDOW&rsquo;&lt;esc&gt;\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &rsquo;&lt;esc&gt;&rsquo;
is an escape, &rsquo;^&rsquo; is a literal up-arrow, and
&rsquo;\&rsquo; turns into a single backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOW TYPES <br>
Screen provides three different window types. New windows
are created with screen&rsquo;s screen command (see also the
entry in chapter &quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot;). The first
parameter to the <br>
screen command defines which type of window is created. The
different window types are all special cases of the normal
type. They have been added in order to allow screen to be
<br>
used efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100 or more
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The normal
window contains a shell (default, if no parameter is given)
or any other system command that could be executed from a
shell (e.g. slogin, etc...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a tty
(character special device) name (e.g. &quot;/dev/ttya&quot;)
is specified as the first parameter, then the window is
directly connected to this device. This window type is <br>
similar to &quot;screen cu -l /dev/ttya&quot;. Read and
write access is required on the device node, an exclusive
open is attempted on the node to mark the connection line as
busy. An <br>
optional parameter is allowed consisting of a comma
separated list of flags in the notation used by stty(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;baud_rate&gt; <br>
Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission
as well as receive speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cs8 or cs7 <br>
Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per
byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ixon or -ixon <br>
Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q)
for sending data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ixoff or -ixoff <br>
Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">istrip or -istrip <br>
Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want to specify as many
of these options as applicable. Unspecified options cause
the terminal driver to make up the parameter values of the
connection. These values <br>
are system dependent and may be in defaults or values saved
from a previous connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For tty windows, the info
command shows some of the modem control lines in the status
line. These may include &lsquo;RTS&rsquo;,
&lsquo;CTS&rsquo;, &rsquo;DTR&rsquo;, &lsquo;DSR&rsquo;,
&lsquo;CD&rsquo; and more. This depends on the <br>
available ioctl()&rsquo;s and system header files as well as
the on the physical capabilities of the serial board.
Signals that are logical low (inactive) have their name
preceded <br>
by an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal is logical
high (active). Signals not supported by the hardware but
available to the ioctl() interface are usually shown
low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the CLOCAL status bit is
true, the whole set of modem signals is placed inside curly
braces ({ and }). When the CRTSCTS or TIOCSOFTCAR bit is
set, the signals &lsquo;CTS&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;CD&rsquo; are shown in parenthesis, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For tty windows, the command
break causes the Data transmission line (TxD) to go low for
a specified period of time. This is expected to be
interpreted as break signal on the <br>
other side. No data is sent and no modem control line is
changed when a break is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the first
parameter is &quot;//telnet&quot;, the second parameter is
expected to be a host name, and an optional third parameter
may specify a TCP port number (default decimal 23). <br>
Screen will connect to a server listening on the remote host
and use the telnet protocol to communicate with that server.
<br>
For telnet windows, the command info shows details about the
connection in square brackets ([ and ]) at the end of the
status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b BINARY. The connection is in
binary mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e ECHO. Local echo is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c SGA. The connection is in
&lsquo;character mode&rsquo; (default: &lsquo;line
mode&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t TTYPE. The terminal type has
been requested by the remote host. Screen sends the name
&quot;screen&quot; unless instructed otherwise (see also the
command &lsquo;term&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w NAWS. The remote site is
notified about window size changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f LFLOW. The remote host will
send flow control information. (Ignored at the moment.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional flags for debugging
are x, t and n (XDISPLOC, TSPEED and NEWENV).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For telnet windows, the command
break sends the telnet code IAC BREAK (decimal 243) to the
remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This window type is only
available if screen was compiled with the BUILTIN_TELNET
option defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRING ESCAPES <br>
Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information
like the current time into messages or file names. The
escape character is &rsquo;%&rsquo; with one exception:
inside of a window&rsquo;s <br>
hardstatus &rsquo;^%&rsquo; (&rsquo;^E&rsquo;) is used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is the full list of
supported escapes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% the escape character
itself</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a either &rsquo;am&rsquo; or
&rsquo;pm&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A either &rsquo;AM&rsquo; or
&rsquo;PM&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c current time HH:MM in 24h
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C current time HH:MM in 12h
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d day number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D weekday name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f flags of the window, see
&quot;windows&quot; for meanings of the various flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F sets %? to true if the window
has the focus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h hardstatus of the window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H hostname of the system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l current load of the system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m month number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M month name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n window number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P sets %? to true if the current
region is in copy/paste mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S session name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t window title</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u all other users on this
window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w all window numbers and names.
With &rsquo;-&rsquo; qualifier: up to the current window;
with &rsquo;+&rsquo; qualifier: starting with the window
after the current one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W all window numbers and names
except the current one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y last two digits of the year
number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y full year number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? the part to the next
&rsquo;%?&rsquo; is displayed only if a &rsquo;%&rsquo;
escape inside the part expands to a non-empty string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: else part of
&rsquo;%?&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= pad the string to the
display&rsquo;s width (like TeX&rsquo;s hfill). If a number
is specified, pad to the percentage of the window&rsquo;s
width. A &rsquo;0&rsquo; qualifier tells screen to treat the
<br>
number as absolute position. You can specify to pad relative
to the last absolute pad position by adding a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; qualifier or to pad relative to the right
margin by using <br>
&rsquo;-&rsquo;. The padding truncates the string if the
specified position lies before the current position. Add the
&rsquo;L&rsquo; qualifier to change this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; same as &rsquo;%=&rsquo;
but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; mark the current text
position for the next truncation. When screen needs to do
truncation, it tries to do it in a way that the marked
position gets moved to the specified <br>
percentage of the output area. (The area starts from the
last absolute pad position and ends with the position
specified by the truncation operator.) The &rsquo;L&rsquo;
qualifier <br>
tells screen to mark the truncated parts with
&rsquo;...&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ attribute/color modifier
string terminated by the next &quot;}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo; Substitute with the
output of a &rsquo;backtick&rsquo; command. The length
qualifier is misused to identify one of the commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;c&rsquo; and
&rsquo;C&rsquo; escape may be qualified with a
&rsquo;0&rsquo; to make screen use zero instead of space as
fill character. The &rsquo;0&rsquo; qualifier also makes the
&rsquo;=&rsquo; escape use absolute positions. <br>
The &rsquo;n&rsquo; and &rsquo;=&rsquo; escapes understand a
length qualifier (e.g. &rsquo;%3n&rsquo;), &rsquo;D&rsquo;
and &rsquo;M&rsquo; can be prefixed with &rsquo;L&rsquo; to
generate long names, &rsquo;w&rsquo; and &rsquo;W&rsquo;
also show the window flags if &rsquo;L&rsquo; is <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An attribute/color modifier is
is used to change the attributes or the color settings. Its
format is &quot;[attribute modifier] [color
description]&quot;. The attribute modifier must be <br>
prefixed by a change type indicator if it can be confused
with a color description. The following change types are
known:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ add the specified set to the
current attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- remove the set from the
current attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! invert the set in the current
attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= change the current attributes
to the specified set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The attribute set can either be
specified as a hexadecimal number or a combination of the
following letters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d dim <br>
u underline <br>
b bold <br>
r reverse <br>
s standout <br>
B blinking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors are coded either as a
hexadecimal number or two letters specifying the desired
background and foreground color (in that order). The
following colors are known:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k black <br>
r red <br>
g green <br>
y yellow <br>
b blue <br>
m magenta <br>
c cyan <br>
w white <br>
d default color <br>
. leave color unchanged</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The capitalized versions of the
letter specify bright colors. You can also use the
pseudo-color &rsquo;i&rsquo; to set just the brightness and
leave the color unchanged. <br>
A one digit/letter color description is treated as
foreground or background color dependent on the current
attributes: if reverse mode is set, the background color is
changed <br>
instead of the foreground color. If you don&rsquo;t like
this, prefix the color with a &quot;.&quot;. If you want the
same behavior for two-letter color descriptions, also prefix
them with a <br>
&quot;.&quot;. <br>
As a special case, &quot;%{-}&quot; restores the attributes
and colors that were set before the last change was made
(i.e., pops one level of the color-change stack).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;G&quot; set color to
bright green</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;+b r&quot; use bold
red</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;= yd&quot; clear all
attributes, write in default color on yellow background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%-Lw%{= BW}%50&gt;%n%f*
%t%{-}%+Lw%&lt; <br>
The available windows centered at the current window and
truncated to the available width. The current window is
displayed white on blue. This can be used with
&quot;hardsta&acirc; <br>
tus alwayslastline&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%? <br>
The window number and title and the window&rsquo;s
hardstatus, if one is set. Also use a red background if this
is the active focus. Useful for &quot;caption
string&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLOW-CONTROL <br>
Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how
screen deals with the XON and XOFF characters (and perhaps
the interrupt character). When flow-control is turned off,
<br>
screen ignores the XON and XOFF characters, which allows the
user to send them to the current program by simply typing
them (useful for the emacs editor, for instance). The <br>
trade-off is that it will take longer for output from a
&quot;normal&quot; program to pause in response to an XOFF.
With flow-control turned on, XON and XOFF characters are
used to imme&acirc; <br>
diately pause the output of the current window. You can
still send these characters to the current program, but you
must use the appropriate two-character screen commands
(typi&acirc; <br>
cally &quot;C-a q&quot; (xon) and &quot;C-a s&quot; (xoff)).
The xon/xoff commands are also useful for typing C-s and C-q
past a terminal that intercepts these characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each window has an initial
flow-control value set with either the -f option or the
&quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc command. Per default the
windows are set to automatic flow-switching. It <br>
can then be toggled between the three states &rsquo;fixed
on&rsquo;, &rsquo;fixed off&rsquo; and
&rsquo;automatic&rsquo; interactively with the
&quot;flow&quot; command bound to &quot;C-a f&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The automatic flow-switching
mode deals with flow control using the TIOCPKT mode (like
&quot;rlogin&quot; does). If the tty driver does not support
TIOCPKT, screen tries to find out the <br>
right mode based on the current setting of the application
keypad - when it is enabled, flow-control is turned off and
visa versa. Of course, you can still manipulate
flow-con&acirc; <br>
trol manually when needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re running with
flow-control enabled and find that pressing the interrupt
key (usually C-c) does not interrupt the display until
another 6-8 lines have scrolled by, try <br>
running screen with the &quot;interrupt&quot; option (add
the &quot;interrupt&quot; flag to the &quot;flow&quot;
command in your .screenrc, or use the -i command-line
option). This causes the output that <br>
screen has accumulated from the interrupted program to be
flushed. One disadvantage is that the virtual
terminal&rsquo;s memory contains the non-flushed version of
the output, which <br>
in rare cases can cause minor inaccuracies in the output.
For example, if you switch screens and return, or update the
screen with &quot;C-a l&quot; you would see the version of
the out&acirc; <br>
put you would have gotten without &quot;interrupt&quot;
being on. Also, you might need to turn off flow-control (or
use auto-flow mode to turn it off automatically) when
running a program <br>
that expects you to type the interrupt character as input,
as it is possible to interrupt the output of the virtual
terminal to your physical terminal when flow-control is <br>
enabled. If this happens, a simple refresh of the screen
with &quot;C-a l&quot; will restore it. Give each mode a
try, and use whichever mode you find more comfortable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TITLES (naming windows) <br>
You can customize each window&rsquo;s name in the window
display (viewed with the &quot;windows&quot; command (C-a
w)) by setting it with one of the title commands. Normally
the name displayed <br>
is the actual command name of the program created in the
window. However, it is sometimes useful to distinguish
various programs of the same name or to change the name
on-the- <br>
fly to reflect the current state of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default name for all shell
windows can be set with the &quot;shelltitle&quot; command
in the .screenrc file, while all other windows are created
with a &quot;screen&quot; command and thus can <br>
have their name set with the -t option. Interactively, there
is the title-string escape-sequence
(&lt;esc&gt;kname&lt;esc&gt; and the &quot;title&quot;
command (C-a A). The former can be output <br>
from an application to control the window&rsquo;s name under
software control, and the latter will prompt for a name when
typed. You can also bind pre-defined names to keys with the
<br>
&quot;title&quot; command to set things quickly without
prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, screen has a
shell-specific heuristic that is enabled by setting the
window&rsquo;s name to &quot;search|name&quot; and arranging
to have a null title escape-sequence output as a part <br>
of your prompt. The search portion specifies an
end-of-prompt search string, while the name portion
specifies the default shell name for the window. If the name
ends in a &lsquo;:&rsquo; <br>
screen will add what it believes to be the current command
running in the window to the end of the window&rsquo;s shell
name (e.g. &quot;name:cmd&quot;). Otherwise the current
command name <br>
supersedes the shell name while it is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s how it works: you
must modify your shell prompt to output a null
title-escape-sequence (&lt;esc&gt;k&lt;esc&gt; as a part of
your prompt. The last part of your prompt must be the <br>
same as the string you specified for the search portion of
the title. Once this is set up, screen will use the
title-escape-sequence to clear the previous command name and
get <br>
ready for the next command. Then, when a newline is received
from the shell, a search is made for the end of the prompt.
If found, it will grab the first word after the matched <br>
string and use it as the command name. If the command name
begins with either &rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;%&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;^&rsquo; screen will use the first word on the
following line (if found) in preference to <br>
the just-found name. This helps csh users get better command
names when using job control or history recall commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s some .screenrc
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen -t top 2 nice top</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding this line to your
.screenrc would start a nice-d version of the
&quot;top&quot; command in window 2 named &quot;top&quot;
rather than &quot;nice&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shelltitle &rsquo;&gt;
|csh&rsquo; <br>
screen 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These commands would start a
shell with the given shelltitle. The title specified is an
auto-title that would expect the prompt and the typed
command to look something like the <br>
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/joe/src/dir&gt; trn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(it looks after the &rsquo;&gt;
&rsquo; for the command name). The window status would show
the name &quot;trn&quot; while the command was running, and
revert to &quot;csh&quot; upon completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind R screen -t &rsquo;%
|root:&rsquo; su</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having this command in your
.screenrc would bind the key sequence &quot;C-a R&quot; to
the &quot;su&quot; command and give it an auto-title name of
&quot;root:&quot;. For this auto-title to work, the screen
<br>
could look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% !em <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the user typed the csh
history command &quot;!em&quot; which ran the previously
entered &quot;emacs&quot; command. The window status would
show &quot;root:emacs&quot; during the execution of the
com&acirc; <br>
mand, and revert to simply &quot;root:&quot; at its
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind o title <br>
bind E title &quot;&quot; <br>
bind u title (unknown)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first binding doesn&rsquo;t
have any arguments, so it would prompt you for a title. when
you type &quot;C-a o&quot;. The second binding would clear
an auto-title&rsquo;s current setting (C-a E). <br>
The third binding would set the current window&rsquo;s title
to &quot;(unknown)&quot; (C-a u).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One thing to keep in mind when
adding a null title-escape-sequence to your prompt is that
some shells (like the csh) count all the non-control
characters as part of the prompt&rsquo;s <br>
length. If these invisible characters aren&rsquo;t a
multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will result in an
incorrect display. One way to get around this is to use a
prompt like <br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set prompt=&rsquo;^[[0000m^[k^[
&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The escape-sequence
&quot;&lt;esc&gt;[0000m&quot; not only normalizes the
character attributes, but all the zeros round the length of
the invisible characters up to 8. Bash users will probably
<br>
want to echo the escape sequence in the PROMPT_COMMAND:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT_COMMAND=&rsquo;printf
&quot; 33k 33134&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL <br>
Each window in a screen session emulates a VT100 terminal,
with some extra functions added. The VT100 emulator is
hard-coded, no other terminal types can be emulated. <br>
Usually screen tries to emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI
standard as possible. But if your terminal lacks certain
capabilities, the emulation may not be complete. In these
cases <br>
screen has to tell the applications that some of the
features are missing. This is no problem on machines using
termcap, because screen can use the $TERMCAP variable to
customize <br>
the standard screen termcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you do a rlogin on
another machine or your machine supports only terminfo this
method fails. Because of this, screen offers a way to deal
with these cases. Here is how it <br>
works:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When screen tries to figure out
a terminal name for itself, it first looks for an entry
named &quot;screen.&lt;term&gt;&quot;, where &lt;term&gt; is
the contents of your $TERM variable. If no such <br>
entry exists, screen tries &quot;screen&quot; (or
&quot;screen-w&quot; if the terminal is wide (132 cols or
more)). If even this entry cannot be found,
&quot;vt100&quot; is used as a substitute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea is that if you have a
terminal which doesn&rsquo;t support an important feature
(e.g. delete char or clear to EOS) you can build a new
termcap/terminfo entry for screen (named <br>
&quot;screen.&lt;dumbterm&gt;&quot;) in which this
capability has been disabled. If this entry is installed on
your machines you are able to do a rlogin and still keep the
correct termcap/ter&acirc; <br>
minfo entry. The terminal name is put in the $TERM variable
of all new windows. Screen also sets the $TERMCAP variable
reflecting the capabilities of the virtual terminal
emu&acirc; <br>
lated. Notice that, however, on machines using the terminfo
database this variable has no effect. Furthermore, the
variable $WINDOW is set to the window number of each
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual set of capabilities
supported by the virtual terminal depends on the
capabilities supported by the physical terminal. If, for
instance, the physical terminal does not <br>
support underscore mode, screen does not put the
&lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;ue&rsquo; capabilities into the
window&rsquo;s $TERMCAP variable, accordingly. However, a
minimum number of capabilities must be <br>
supported by a terminal in order to run screen; namely
scrolling, clear screen, and direct cursor addressing (in
addition, screen does not run on hardcopy terminals or on
termi&acirc; <br>
nals that over-strike).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you can customize the
$TERMCAP value used by screen by using the
&quot;termcap&quot; .screenrc command, or by defining the
variable $SCREENCAP prior to startup. When the is latter
<br>
defined, its value will be copied verbatim into each
window&rsquo;s $TERMCAP variable. This can either be the
full terminal definition, or a filename where the terminal
&quot;screen&quot; <br>
(and/or &quot;screen-w&quot;) is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that screen honors the
&quot;terminfo&quot; .screenrc command if the system uses
the terminfo database rather than termcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the boolean
&lsquo;G0&rsquo; capability is present in the termcap entry
for the terminal on which screen has been called, the
terminal emulation of screen supports multiple character
<br>
sets. This allows an application to make use of, for
instance, the VT100 graphics character set or national
character sets. The following control functions from ISO
2022 are <br>
supported: lock shift G0 (SI), lock shift G1 (SO), lock
shift G2, lock shift G3, single shift G2, and single shift
G3. When a virtual terminal is created or reset, the ASCII
<br>
character set is designated as G0 through G3. When the
&lsquo;G0&rsquo; capability is present, screen evaluates the
capabilities &lsquo;S0&rsquo;, &lsquo;E0&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;C0&rsquo; if present. &lsquo;S0&rsquo; is the
sequence the <br>
terminal uses to enable and start the graphics character set
rather than SI. &lsquo;E0&rsquo; is the corresponding
replacement for SO. &lsquo;C0&rsquo; gives a character by
character translation string <br>
that is used during semi-graphics mode. This string is built
like the &lsquo;acsc&rsquo; terminfo capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &lsquo;po&rsquo; and
&lsquo;pf&rsquo; capabilities are present in the
terminal&rsquo;s termcap entry, applications running in a
screen window can send output to the printer port of the
terminal. <br>
This allows a user to have an application in one window
sending output to a printer connected to the terminal, while
all other windows are still active (the printer port is <br>
enabled and disabled again for each chunk of output). As a
side-effect, programs running in different windows can send
output to the printer simultaneously. Data sent to the <br>
printer is not displayed in the window. The info command
displays a line starting &lsquo;PRIN&rsquo; while the
printer is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen maintains a hardstatus
line for every window. If a window gets selected, the
display&rsquo;s hardstatus will be updated to match the
window&rsquo;s hardstatus line. If the display has <br>
no hardstatus the line will be displayed as a standard
screen message. The hardstatus line can be changed with the
ANSI Application Program Command (APC):
&quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC <br>
a convenience for xterm users the sequence
&quot;ESC]0..2;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot; is also accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some capabilities are only put
into the $TERMCAP variable of the virtual terminal if they
can be efficiently implemented by the physical terminal. For
instance, &lsquo;dl&rsquo; (delete <br>
line) is only put into the $TERMCAP variable if the terminal
supports either delete line itself or scrolling regions.
Note that this may provoke confusion, when the session is
<br>
reattached on a different terminal, as the value of $TERMCAP
cannot be modified by parent processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;alternate screen&quot;
capability is not enabled by default. Set the altscreen
.screenrc command to enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT TRANSLATION <br>
In order to do a full VT100 emulation screen has to detect
that a sequence of characters in the input stream was
generated by a keypress on the user&rsquo;s keyboard and
insert the <br>
VT100 style escape sequence. Screen has a very flexible way
of doing this by making it possible to map arbitrary
commands on arbitrary sequences of characters. For standard
VT100 <br>
emulation the command will always insert a string in the
input buffer of the window (see also command stuff in the
command table). Because the sequences generated by a
keypress <br>
can change after a reattach from a different terminal type,
it is possible to bind commands to the termcap name of the
keys. Screen will insert the correct binding after each <br>
reattach. See the bindkey command for further details on the
syntax and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is the table of the default
key bindings. (A) means that the command is executed if the
keyboard is switched into application mode.</p>

<br>
The following table describes all terminal capabilities that
are recognized by screen and are not in the termcap(5)
manual. You can place these capabilities in your termcap

entries (in &lsquo;/etc/termcap&rsquo;) or use them with the
commands &lsquo;termcap&rsquo;, &lsquo;terminfo&rsquo; and
&lsquo;termcapinfo&rsquo; in your screenrc files. It is
often not possible to place these capabilities in <br>
the terminfo database.</p>

&lt;mapping&gt; :=
&lt;char-to-be-mapped&gt;&lt;template-arg&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The things in braces may be
repeated any number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &lt;charset-mapping&gt; tells
screen how to map characters in font &lt;designator&gt;
(&rsquo;B&rsquo;: Ascii, &rsquo;A&rsquo;: UK,
&rsquo;K&rsquo;: German, etc.) to strings. Every
&lt;mapping&gt; describes to what string a sin&acirc; <br>
gle character will be translated. A template mechanism is
used, as most of the time the codes have a lot in common
(for example strings to switch to and from another charset).
<br>
Each occurrence of &rsquo;%&rsquo; in &lt;template&gt; gets
substituted with the &lt;template-arg&gt; specified together
with the character. If your strings are not similar at all,
then use &rsquo;%&rsquo; as a <br>
template and place the full string in &lt;template-arg&gt;.
A quoting mechanism was added to make it possible to use a
real &rsquo;%&rsquo;. The &rsquo;&acute; character quotes
the special characters &rsquo;&acute;, <br>
&rsquo;%&rsquo;, and &rsquo;,&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap hp700
&rsquo;XC=B304[,326\\,334]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells screen how to
translate ISOlatin1 (charset &rsquo;B&rsquo;) upper case
umlaut characters on a hp700 terminal that has a German
charset. &rsquo;304&rsquo; gets translated to &rsquo; and
<br>
so on. Note that this line gets parsed *three* times before
the internal lookup table is built, therefore a lot of
quoting is needed to create a single &rsquo;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another extension was added to
allow more emulation: If a mapping translates the unquoted
&rsquo;%&rsquo; char, it will be sent to the terminal
whenever screen switches to the corresponding <br>
&lt;designator&gt;. In this special case the template is
assumed to be just &rsquo;%&rsquo; because the charset
switch sequence and the character mappings normally
haven&rsquo;t much in common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example shows one use of
the extension:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termcap xterm
&rsquo;XC=K%,%[304,\\326,]334&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, a part of the German
(&rsquo;K&rsquo;) charset is emulated on an xterm. If screen
has to change to the &rsquo;K&rsquo; charset, &rsquo; will
be sent to the terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used <br>
instead. The template is just &rsquo;%&rsquo;, so the
mapping is straightforward: &rsquo;[&rsquo; to
&rsquo;304&rsquo;, &rsquo;&acute; to &rsquo;326&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;]&rsquo; to &rsquo;334&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This is version 4.1.0. Its roots are a merge of a custom
version 2.3PR7 by Wayne Davison and several enhancements to
Oliver Laumann&rsquo;s version 2.0. Note that all versions
numbered <br>
2.x are copyright by Oliver Laumann.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
The latest official release of screen available via
anonymous ftp from gnudist.gnu.org, nic.funet.fi or any
other GNU distribution site. The home site of screen is
ftp.uni-erlan&acirc; <br>
gen.de, in the directory pub/utilities/screen. The
subdirectory &lsquo;private&rsquo; contains the latest beta
testing release. If you want to help, send a note to
screen@uni-erlangen.de.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &lsquo;dm&rsquo; (delete mode) and
&lsquo;xs&rsquo; are not handled correctly (they are
ignored). &lsquo;xn&rsquo; is treated as a magic-margin
indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Screen has no
clue about double-high or double-wide characters. But this
is the only area where vttest is allowed to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is not
possible to change the environment variable $TERMCAP when
reattaching under a different terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The support of
terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra
capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have any effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Screen does not
make use of hardware tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Screen must be
installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems in
order to be able to correctly change the owner of the tty
device file for each window. Special permis&acirc; <br>
sion may also be required to write the file
&quot;/etc/utmp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Entries in
&quot;/etc/utmp&quot; are not removed when screen is killed
with SIGKILL. This will cause some programs (like
&quot;w&quot; or &quot;rwho&quot;) to advertise that a user
is logged on who really <br>
isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Screen may give
a strange warning when your tty has no utmp entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When the modem
line was hung up, screen may not automatically detach (or
quit) unless the device driver is configured to send a
HANGUP signal. To detach a screen session use <br>
the -D or -d command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a password is
set, the command line options -d and -D still detach a
session without asking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Both
&quot;breaktype&quot; and &quot;defbreaktype&quot; change
the break generating method used by all terminal devices.
The first should change a window specific setting, where the
latter should <br>
change only the default for new windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When attaching
to a multiuser session, the user&rsquo;s .screenrc file is
not sourced. Each user&rsquo;s personal settings have to be
included in the .screenrc file from which the session <br>
is booted, or have to be changed manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A weird
imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Send
bug-reports, fixes, enhancements, t-shirts, money, beer
&amp; pizza to screen@uni-erlangen.de.</p>
