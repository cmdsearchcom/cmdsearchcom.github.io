<p>FvwmSave(1) General Commands Manual FvwmSave(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmSave - the FVWM desktop-layout saving module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmSave is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When called, this module will attempt to save your current
desktop layout into a file called new.xinitrc. Ideally, this
file will look just like .xinitrc, but in reality, you <br>
will have to edit it to get a usable configuration, so be
sure to keep a backup of your old .xinitrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your applications must supply
certain hints to the X window system. Emacs, for example,
does not, so FvwmSave can&rsquo;t get any information from
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, FvwmSave assumes that
certain command line options are globally accepted by
applications, which may not be the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHTS <br>
The NoClutter program, and the concept for interfacing this
module to the Window Manager, are all original work by
Robert Nation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copyright 1994, Robert Nation.
No guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or
implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your own
risk. Permission to use this <br>
program for any purpose is given, as long as the copyright
is kept intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
During initialization, NoClutter will eventually search a
configuration file which describes the time-outs and actions
to take. The configuration file is the same file that fvwm
<br>
used during initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the NoClutter executable is
linked to another name, ie ln -s NoClutter OtherClutter,
then another module called OtherClutter can be started, with
a completely different con&acirc; <br>
figuration than NoClutter, simply by changing the keyword
NoClutter to OtherClutter. This way multiple
clutter-reduction programs can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
NoClutter can be invoked by inserting the line &rsquo;Module
NoClutter&rsquo; in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on
a line by itself, if NoClutter is to be spawned during
fvwm&rsquo;s ini&acirc; <br>
tialization, or can be bound to a menu or mouse button or
keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search directory
specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to <br>
locate NoClutter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
NoClutter reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it
starts up, and looks for lines similar to &quot;*NoClutter
3600 Iconify&quot;. The format of these lines is
&quot;*NoClutter [time] <br>
[command]&quot;, where command is any fvwm built-in command,
and time is the time in seconds between when a window looses
focus and when the command is executed. At most 3 actions
can <br>
be specified.</p>
