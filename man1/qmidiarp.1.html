QMidiArp is an advanced MIDI arpeggiator, programmable step sequencer and LFO.
  It runs with either JACK MIDI or ALSA MIDI. It can hold any number of
  arpeggiator or LFO modules running in parallel. The arpeggiator modules
  produce sequences depending on the notes sent to their input port, which is
  typically connected to a keyboard or another sequencer. The step sequencer
  modules allow you to create simple linear, monophonic and globally
  transposable sequences similar to the first analog sequencers. The MIDI LFOs
  independently produce MIDI controller data of adjustable waveform, time
  resolution, amplitude and duration. For each module, an input note filter is
  available, and the output port and channel can be set independently. Since the
  modules use a common sequencer queue, they are automatically in sync with each
  other. QMidiArp works with an internal tick resolution of 192 ticks per beat.
  The queue can be synchronized to an incoming MIDI realtime clock or as a JACK
  transport client. Most of the relevant control elements are accessible via
  MIDI controller through a MIDI-learn infrastructure. QMidiArp also has a log
  tool displaying the history of incoming MIDI events in colors depending on
  their type. QMidiArp is based on the Qt4 toolkit.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="General_Operation"><a class="selflink" href="#General_Operation">General
  Operation</a></h2>
When no commandline options are given, QMidiArp starts as a JACK MIDI client
  with an input port and two output ports. For starting QMidiArp as an ALSA
  client, use the -a option. A new arpeggiator or LFO module can be created by
  clicking one of the <b>Add Arp..., Add LFO...</b> or <b>Add Step
  Sequencer...</b> buttons, which will show a new tab with the chosen module in
  the main area. The modules can be renamed or removed using the corresponding
  buttons or menu functions. Modules can be detached from the main window to
  control and view them in parallel. They can be brought back to the main window
  again by clicking on the icon on the left side of each module title bar. They
  can also be aligned side-by-side within the same window if the main window is
  stretched sufficiently before reinserting a module. The entire setup
  containing all arps, sequences and LFOs in the tab bar along with the
  parameters set in the <b>Settings</b> window can be saved to or loaded from a
  QMidiArp XML file (.qmax). The <b>tempo</b> of the queue can be set in beats
  per minute and affects all modules. The queue is started and stopped by the
  blue arrow button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MIDI_Clock_operation_(ALSA_MIDI_only)"><a class="selflink" href="#MIDI_Clock_operation_(ALSA_MIDI_only)">MIDI
  Clock operation (ALSA MIDI only)</a></h2>
In ALSA mode, QMidiArp runs using its own clock and tempo, but it can optionally
  use incoming MIDI clock events as clock and start/stop control source. If the
  <b>MIDI clock button</b> right of the tempo box is pressed, the running ALSA
  queue is stopped, and QMidiArp will wait for an incoming &quot;MIDI Clock
  Start&quot; event from an external source connected to QMidiArp's MIDI input.
  Once this event is received, the queue is started using MIDI realtime clock
  events as clock source. QMidiArp will best remain in sync with the incoming
  MIDI clock if its internal tempo value (see above) approximately corresponds
  to that of the incoming clock. The MIDI clock tempo is, however, measured
  while the queue is running. Therefore, if the tempos of the MIDI clock and
  that of QMidiArp differ, synchronization should become stable from the second
  queue start. The queue will stop when a MIDI Clock Stop event is received.
  During MIDI Clock operation, QMidiArp's own clock start and stop functions as
  well as adding or loading new setups are disabled. They are enabled again by
  unchecking the MIDI clock button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="JACK_Transport_Client_Operation"><a class="selflink" href="#JACK_Transport_Client_Operation">JACK
  Transport Client Operation</a></h2>
When the <b>Jack Transport Connect</b> button is pressed, QMidiArp will try to
  connect to a running Jack server and then function as a Jack Transport client,
  i.e. set its tempo and remain synchronized to a running Jack Transport master.
  Note that QMidiArp will restart its queue from zero whenever Jack transport is
  starting regardless of Jack Transport's position. This also applies in case of
  a looping Jack Transport queue. The Jack button will be released automatically
  if QMidiArp gets disconnected from Jack by a possible Jack shutdown or if Jack
  is not available at connection time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: MIDI Clock and Jack Transport button states will be saved with the
  QMidiArp session file, and get active or inactive when a new session file is
  loaded.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Arpeggiator_Modules"><a class="selflink" href="#Arpeggiator_Modules">Arpeggiator
  Modules</a></h2>
QMidiArp's arpeggiators can produce complex patterns derived from the notes
  played on a MIDI keyboard. QMidiArp's arpeggiator modules were inspired by the
  MAP1 hardware arpeggiator by Rudi Linhard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Input and Output panels</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each arpeggiator has an <b>Input</b> and an <b>Output</b> panel. The Input panel
  defines the note range and the MIDI channel to which the arp is assigned.
  Notes that pass this Input filter are sorted by pitch and added to the
  internal note buffer of the arpeggiator. Incoming notes that do not match any
  filter can either be discarded or forwarded to a selectable MIDI port (see
  <b>Settings</b> ). The <b>Output</b> panel holds settings for the <b>MIDI
  channel</b> and <b>output port</b> to which the arpeggiator notes will be
  sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Arpeggiator Patterns</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arpeggio patterns can be selected and edited in the <b>Pattern</b> panel.
  <b>Pattern presets</b> are selectable from a combo box. The currently active
  pattern is displayed as a piano roll type screen showing the base notes as
  streaks. The y-scale of the graphics window corresponds to the index of the
  notes in the pattern. Octave changes (see <b>Editing patterns</b> ) are shown
  as additional horizontal lines. The notes that are eventually sent depend on
  the input notes received by the arpeggiator. The received notes notes are
  attributed in ascending order to the notes defined in the pattern. For
  example, a single streak on the bottom of the arp display (&quot;simple&quot;
  presets) means that at the first pass through the pattern, the lowermost note
  played on the keyboard is played. If a chord is played on the keyboard and
  only one note is present in the pattern, only the lowermost pressed note is
  output at the first pass through the pattern. For the following repetitions of
  the pattern, the chosen &quot;repeat mode&quot; is used to determine the
  following notes. If the pattern contains stacked note streaks (chord mode),
  chords played on the keyboard are also output as chords with polyphony up to
  the number of notes defined in the stack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Repeat Mode</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This setting defines the behavior of the arpeggio over several repetitions of
  the pattern when the number of notes pressed on the keyboard is higher than
  the number of notes present in the pattern. When <b>Repeat Mode</b> is
  &quot;Up&quot;, the next higher note played on the keyboard is played at each
  repetition. With &quot;Down&quot;, the next lower note is played. With a
  single note present in the arp pattern, this creates classical linear
  arpeggios. This way even simple patterns like &quot;01&quot; (or even
  &quot;0&quot;) will generate a complete arpeggio. When &quot;Static&quot; is
  selected, this classical arpeggio mode will be disabled, and the output notes
  remain constant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Trigger mode</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
QMidiArp's arpeggiators can run in three modes. &quot;No trigger&quot; will
  cause the arp running continuously in synchronization with the internal or
  external clock source. Even when new notes are played, they will be output
  quantized to the running queue. &quot;Kbd restart&quot; will cause a reset of
  the playhead position upon the next note to be output, but the output pattern
  stays quantized to the queue. When &quot;Kbd trigger&quot; is selected, each
  new note played in stakato will trigger the pattern with the timing of the
  played note.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Editing Arp patterns</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arp patterns are defined by a text sequence containing the notes themselves as
  numbers along with control changes for chord, tempo, velocity and octave
  changes. When the <b>Edit pattern</b> button in the pattern panel is clicked,
  the current pattern preset appears as a text input line. The edited pattern
  can be stored in the preset list by clicking on the <b>Store pattern</b>
  button. The currently active pattern can be removed from the preset list by
  clicking on the <b>Remove pattern</b> button. All preset patterns are
  immediately saved in the .qmidiarprc resource file when a pattern is stored or
  removed, and the new pattern list is made available to the other arps in the
  tab bar. Pattern presets are automatically loaded on each application start.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The syntax for the pattern text is as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
0..9 : Note indices
<br/>
 + : One octave up
<br/>
 - : One octave down
<br/>
 = : Reset to standard octave
<br/>
 &gt; : Double tempo
<br/>
 &lt; : Half tempo
<br/>
 . : Reset to standard tempo
<br/>
 ( ) : Chord, begin..end,
<br/>
 e.g. (012) would be a chord of the
<br/>
 lowermost three notes in the buffer
<br/>
 / : Volume up by 20%
<br/>
 \ : Volume down by 20%
<br/>
 d : Double length
<br/>
 h : Half length
<br/>
 p : Pause
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any token is valid until the end of a pattern is reached. The token &gt; will
  e.g. double the tempo for all following notes of the pattern. When the loop
  jumps back to the beginning of the pattern, the tempo is reset to its initial
  value, i.e. a quarter note.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Random</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The timing, velocity and length of the output notes can be randomized using the
  sliders in the <b>Random</b> panel. These settings can be used to make the
  arpeggiator sound less mechanical, but if they are set to higher values, they
  add interesting accents to the patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Envelope</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
QMidiArp can modulate the velocity of the arpeggios with an envelope function
  defined by <b>Attack</b> time and <b>Release</b> time. If an attack time is
  set, the velocities of the output notes are ramped up during the attack time
  defined in seconds. If a release time is set, notes released from the keyboard
  are continued to be output while their velocity is ramped down linearly and
  until the release time has reached its end. The envelope function only makes
  sense if the sound driven by the arp is velocity-sensitive. It works best with
  highly polyphonic patterns such as &quot;Chord Oct 16 A&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Groove</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Groove</b> sliders control a linear shift of timing, length and velocity
  within each beat of the output pattern. This can be used to create swing
  timing and accent. The Groove settings are adjusted for all arps
  simultaneously.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="LFO_Modules"><a class="selflink" href="#LFO_Modules">LFO
  Modules</a></h2>
In parallel to the arps, QMidiArp can send MIDI controller data in form of a low
  frequency oscillator (LFO) to the assigned output. The LFO data consist of
  controller events that are in sync with the arpeggiator queue. The queue has
  to be in running state to enable the LFO. Each LFO module has a
  <b>waveform</b> panel to define the shape of the outgoing data and an
  <b>output</b> panel to define MIDI Channel, ALSA port and controller number to
  be produced. The waveform can currently be set to Sine, Saw Up, Saw Down,
  Triangle, Square and Custom. The <b>frequency</b> of the LFO can be set in
  muliples and divisors of the arp <b>tempo,</b> such that frequency of 1
  produces one full wave per beat. If frequencies lower than 1 are selected, the
  length of the wavetable has to be adjusted correspondingly to produce a full
  wave. The time <b>resolution</b> of the LFO determines the number of events
  produced every beat and can be adjusted to up to 192 events per beat.
  <b>Amplitude</b> and <b>offset</b> of the waveform can be adjusted from
  0...127. Low <b>resolutions</b> lead to audibly discrete rythmic controller
  changes whereas higher resolution values lead to more continuous waves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Muting individual wave points</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Individual wave points can be muted/unmuted by clicking on the corresponding
  location in the wave display with the <i>right mouse button.</i> A muted wave
  point is shown in darker color.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Custom Waveforms</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>Custom</b> is selected, the waveform can be drawn with the <i>left mouse
  button</i> in the waveform display. A calculated waveform is copied to the
  custom waveform whenever it is being modified by the mouse. This will
  overwrite the previous custom waveform with the currently displayed waveform.
  As all LFO operations, drawing and muting can be done while the queue is
  running, and becomes effective immediately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Play direction and looping</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The play mode can be switched between:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 -&gt;_&gt; : Forward and Loop
<br/>
 &lt;_&lt;- : Backward and Loop
<br/>
 -&gt;_&lt; : Forward and Bounce
<br/>
 &gt;_&lt;- : Backward and Bounce
<br/>
 -&gt;_| : Forward Single shot
<br/>
 |_&lt;- : Backward Single shot
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The direction and loop settings apply immediately when changed on the fly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Recording</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The LFO records incoming controller data as selected in the <b>Input</b> panel,
  when the <b>Record</b> button is pressed. Note that the Record button itself
  can be attributed to a MIDI toggle controller so that it provides a convenient
  implementation of a controller motion sampler and looper.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LFO Input panel</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input panel contains settings on which <b>MIDI CC</b> is to be recorded, how
  the LFO acts to note events received on the input. As the arpeggiators, the
  LFO can be restarted or (re-) triggered by notes played on the keyboard, and
  the wave output can be stopped or not when <b>Note Off</b> events are received
  on the input <b>Channel</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LFO Output panel</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The LFO output panel contains the <b>port,</b> <b>channel</b> and
  <b>controller</b> number settings of the LFO data produced by each LFO tab.
  You can also <b>mute</b> each LFO wave.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Step_Sequencer_Modules"><a class="selflink" href="#Step_Sequencer_Modules">Step
  Sequencer Modules</a></h2>
By clicking <b>Add Step Sequencer...</b> in the control tool bar, a new
  <b>Seq</b> module can be added to the tab bar. Each of these modules produce a
  simple linear (monophonic) sequence, similar to the first analog hardware
  sequencers. The Seq modules are controllable while running, also in a similar
  way to analog step sequencers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Programming a sequence</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As QMidiArp's LFO modules, the step sequencer can be programmed by adjusting
  notes with left mouse clicks on the sequence display. The octave range is
  fixed to 4. The lowest note is C2 if the global transpose is set to 0. Notes
  can be muted with the right mouse click. The sequence <b>length</b> can be
  adjusted between 1 and 8 beats, and the time <b>resolution</b> can be set to
  values between 1 and 16 per beat. A resolution of 4 means that 4 notes are
  output every beat, i.e. sixteenth notes. The sequence can also be programmed
  using the <b>Record</b> function. When the <b>Record</b> button is pressed,
  notes received on the input port will be recorded step-by-step starting from
  the last modified note. Programming can be done on the fly also when the
  sequencer queue is running.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Controlling the sequence globally</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are sliders to adjust the global <b>velocity</b> (volume), <b>note
  length</b> and <b>transpose</b> of the sequence in semitones.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Seq Input and Output panels</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Seq <b>Input</b> panel determines how to handle incoming notes on the MIDI
  <b>Channel</b> set in the channel box. If <b>Note</b> is checked, the sequence
  will be globally transposed with the incoming note as transpose value. If
  <b>Velocity</b> is checked in addition, the sequence will output notes with
  the same velocity as that received on its input. The <b>Input</b> panel also
  determines how the sequence behaves when incoming notes are received. It can
  be restarted, triggered and stopped with the timing of received notes as the
  LFO modules.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Seq <b>Output</b> panel is equivalent to that of arpeggiator and LFO
  modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that accents within a pattern can be produced by running LFO modules in
  parallel to the Seq module, and by sending to the same channel and port as the
  Seq module.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Settings"><a class="selflink" href="#Settings">Settings</a></h2>
The Settings window allows one to configure if and to which port incoming events
  that do not match any module's input filter are forwarded ( <b>unmatched</b>
  events). It also allows one to set whether incoming controller events are
  recognized for muting and controlling the modules separately. If this option
  is set, QMidiArp will recognize MIDI control events that can be attributed to
  different parameters (see <b>MIDI Control</b> ). By checking the <b>compact
  module style</b> all new created modules will show with small GUI elements to
  be more economic in space when distributed as separate windows over the
  desktop.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All settings in this dialog are stored along with the module data in the qmax
  session file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MIDI_control"><a class="selflink" href="#MIDI_control">MIDI
  control</a></h2>
QMidiArp supports MIDI control events if the <b>Modules controllable by MIDI
  CC</b> option is checked in the <b>Settings</b> dialog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MIDI Learn</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Controllers can be attributed by right-clicking on the sliders or mute checkbox
  in each module and selecting <b>MIDI Learn.</b> QMidiArp will then wait for
  MIDI control events, and moving a MIDI controller connected to QMidiArp's
  input will attribute this controller to the control item. It is possible to
  add several MIDI controllers to one item. If <b>MIDI Forget</b> is selected,
  all controllers for that item are removed. If <b>Cancel MIDI learning</b> is
  selected, the learn process is stopped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that by default, mute controllers are interpreted as toggles, i.e. the mute
  state is toggled on reception of a value of 127 from the attributed
  controller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Control Editor</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Control Editor</b> is accessible from the <i>View</i> menu. Controls can
  be edited by MIDI control number, channel, and the minimum and maximum values
  that are sent to the control item. Mute controllers have a special behaviour.
  If minimum and maximum are <i>equal,</i> the controller acts as toggler upon
  reception of the adjusted value. If minimum is <i>different</i> from maximum,
  the corresponding module will be muted upon reception of minimum and unmuted
  upon reception of maximum as values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>Remove</b> is pressed, the currently selected line will be removed,
  pressing <b>Revert</b> reloads the current controller settings. Pressing
  <b>Cancel</b> quits the control editor without applying changes, and only if
  <b>OK</b> is pressed, the edited control list becomes active.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Global_Storage"><a class="selflink" href="#Global_Storage">Global
  Storage</a></h2>
There is another dock window available for storing and restoring most of the
  parameters of all modules at once. In this window, each module and its
  storages appear as a column, the first column representing switches for all
  modules globally. When the small <b>Store</b> button on the left is clicked,
  all modules will store their parameters in a location given by the current
  row, and the next available storage location appears. Module storages can be
  recalled by clicking on the buttons of each individual module or globally
  (numbered buttons in the first column). Storage locations can be removed again
  by clicking on the &quot;arrow&quot; button on the bottom of the list. When a
  new module is added at a time when storage locations already exist for other
  modules, the storage locations for the new module will be empty and can be
  filled by using <b>Store</b> again at this location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When QMidiArp is running, the switch behavior will depend on the selection made
  in the comboboxes in the first row of the window.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>End of</b> will cause parameter switches to occur when the module in the
  second combobox reaches its pattern end. When individual switches are done the
  module in the column of the clicked module determines the switch time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>After</b> will do parameter switches at the end of the number of beats
  selected in the second combobox after the restore button is clicked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The switch can be done by MIDI controller assigned by the MIDI Learn context
  menu of the top button of each column. Note that it is the the controller
  value that corresponds to the storage location, and that you may want to
  adjust the range of controllers to your needs using the <b>MIDI Control
  Editor</b> With the <b>Global Storage</b> handler, QMidiArp can act as a
  simple but handy live sequencer tool. But the <b>Golbal Storage</b> button in
  the <b>View</b> menu and in the main toolbar toggles visibility of the Global
  Storage window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Event_Log"><a class="selflink" href="#Event_Log">Event
  Log</a></h2>
The <b>Event Log</b> displays incoming MIDI events. It is displayed in the
  bottom area by default, but can be hidden if not needed or set floating as a
  top-level window on the desktop. Logging can also be disabled generally or for
  MIDI Clock events only.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Example_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Example_Files">Example

There are currently three demo arpeggios. The demo.qma arpeggio was intended to
  be used with the following sound types: Ch 1: Marimba, Ch 2: Celesta, Ch 3:
  Acoustic Bass, but you can get interesting results if you use other instrument
  settings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The demo_seqlfo.qmax setup shows the use of the new sequencer and LFO modules
  playing in parallel. The sequencer outputs should be routed to percussive
  synthesizer sounds. The LFO data is intended to act on filter cutoff, which
  has the standard controller CC#74. ZynAddSubFX by Paul Nasca reacts on these
  filter cutoff controllers. The &quot;Bass 1&quot; and &quot;Plucked 3&quot;
  presets from this synthesizer work well with this demo file.
