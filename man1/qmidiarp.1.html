<p>QMIDIARP(1) General Commands Manual QMIDIARP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qmidiarp - MIDI arpeggiator and LFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qmidiarp [OPTION] [file] <br>
qmidiarp { --help | --version }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
QMidiArp is an advanced MIDI arpeggiator, programmable step
sequencer and LFO. It runs with either JACK MIDI or ALSA
MIDI. It can hold any number of arpeggiator or LFO modules
<br>
running in parallel. The arpeggiator modules produce
sequences depending on the notes sent to their input port,
which is typically connected to a keyboard or another
sequencer. <br>
The step sequencer modules allow you to create simple
linear, monophonic and globally transposable sequences
similar to the first analog sequencers. The MIDI LFOs
independently <br>
produce MIDI controller data of adjustable waveform, time
resolution, amplitude and duration. For each module, an
input note filter is available, and the output port and
channel <br>
can be set independently. Since the modules use a common
sequencer queue, they are automatically in sync with each
other. QMidiArp works with an internal tick resolution of
192 <br>
ticks per beat. The queue can be synchronized to an incoming
MIDI realtime clock or as a JACK transport client. Most of
the relevant control elements are accessible via MIDI
con&acirc; <br>
troller through a MIDI-learn infrastructure. QMidiArp also
has a log tool displaying the history of incoming MIDI
events in colors depending on their type. QMidiArp is based
on <br>
the Qt4 toolkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Operation <br>
When no commandline options are given, QMidiArp starts as a
JACK MIDI client with an input port and two output ports.
For starting QMidiArp as an ALSA client, use the -a option.
<br>
A new arpeggiator or LFO module can be created by clicking
one of the Add Arp..., Add LFO... or Add Step Sequencer...
buttons, which will show a new tab with the chosen module
<br>
in the main area. The modules can be renamed or removed
using the corresponding buttons or menu functions. Modules
can be detached from the main window to control and view
them <br>
in parallel. They can be brought back to the main window
again by clicking on the icon on the left side of each
module title bar. They can also be aligned side-by-side
within the <br>
same window if the main window is stretched sufficiently
before reinserting a module. The entire setup containing all
arps, sequences and LFOs in the tab bar along with the <br>
parameters set in the Settings window can be saved to or
loaded from a QMidiArp XML file (.qmax). The tempo of the
queue can be set in beats per minute and affects all
modules. <br>
The queue is started and stopped by the blue arrow
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIDI Clock operation (ALSA MIDI
only) <br>
In ALSA mode, QMidiArp runs using its own clock and tempo,
but it can optionally use incoming MIDI clock events as
clock and start/stop control source. If the MIDI clock
button <br>
right of the tempo box is pressed, the running ALSA queue is
stopped, and QMidiArp will wait for an incoming &quot;MIDI
Clock Start&quot; event from an external source connected to
<br>
QMidiArp&rsquo;s MIDI input. Once this event is received,
the queue is started using MIDI realtime clock events as
clock source. QMidiArp will best remain in sync with the
incoming <br>
MIDI clock if its internal tempo value (see above)
approximately corresponds to that of the incoming clock. The
MIDI clock tempo is, however, measured while the queue is
running. <br>
Therefore, if the tempos of the MIDI clock and that of
QMidiArp differ, synchronization should become stable from
the second queue start. The queue will stop when a MIDI
Clock <br>
Stop event is received. During MIDI Clock operation,
QMidiArp&rsquo;s own clock start and stop functions as well
as adding or loading new setups are disabled. They are
enabled again by <br>
unchecking the MIDI clock button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK Transport Client Operation
<br>
When the Jack Transport Connect button is pressed, QMidiArp
will try to connect to a running Jack server and then
function as a Jack Transport client, i.e. set its tempo and
<br>
remain synchronized to a running Jack Transport master. Note
that QMidiArp will restart its queue from zero whenever Jack
transport is starting regardless of Jack Transport&rsquo;s
<br>
position. This also applies in case of a looping Jack
Transport queue. The Jack button will be released
automatically if QMidiArp gets disconnected from Jack by a
possible Jack <br>
shutdown or if Jack is not available at connection time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: MIDI Clock and Jack
Transport button states will be saved with the QMidiArp
session file, and get active or inactive when a new session
file is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arpeggiator Modules <br>
QMidiArp&rsquo;s arpeggiators can produce complex patterns
derived from the notes played on a MIDI keyboard.
QMidiArp&rsquo;s arpeggiator modules were inspired by the
MAP1 hardware arpeggia&acirc; <br>
tor by Rudi Linhard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input and Output panels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each arpeggiator has an Input
and an Output panel. The Input panel defines the note range
and the MIDI channel to which the arp is assigned. Notes
that pass this Input filter are <br>
sorted by pitch and added to the internal note buffer of the
arpeggiator. Incoming notes that do not match any filter can
either be discarded or forwarded to a selectable MIDI <br>
port (see Settings ). The Output panel holds settings for
the MIDI channel and output port to which the arpeggiator
notes will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arpeggiator Patterns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arpeggio patterns can be
selected and edited in the Pattern panel. Pattern presets
are selectable from a combo box. The currently active
pattern is displayed as a piano roll <br>
type screen showing the base notes as streaks. The y-scale
of the graphics window corresponds to the index of the notes
in the pattern. Octave changes (see Editing patterns ) are
<br>
shown as additional horizontal lines. The notes that are
eventually sent depend on the input notes received by the
arpeggiator. The received notes notes are attributed in <br>
ascending order to the notes defined in the pattern. For
example, a single streak on the bottom of the arp display
(&quot;simple&quot; presets) means that at the first pass
through the <br>
pattern, the lowermost note played on the keyboard is
played. If a chord is played on the keyboard and only one
note is present in the pattern, only the lowermost pressed
note <br>
is output at the first pass through the pattern. For the
following repetitions of the pattern, the chosen
&quot;repeat mode&quot; is used to determine the following
notes. If the pattern <br>
contains stacked note streaks (chord mode), chords played on
the keyboard are also output as chords with polyphony up to
the number of notes defined in the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat Mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting defines the
behavior of the arpeggio over several repetitions of the
pattern when the number of notes pressed on the keyboard is
higher than the number of notes <br>
present in the pattern. When Repeat Mode is &quot;Up&quot;,
the next higher note played on the keyboard is played at
each repetition. With &quot;Down&quot;, the next lower note
is played. With a <br>
single note present in the arp pattern, this creates
classical linear arpeggios. This way even simple patterns
like &quot;01&quot; (or even &quot;0&quot;) will generate a
complete arpeggio. When <br>
&quot;Static&quot; is selected, this classical arpeggio mode
will be disabled, and the output notes remain constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trigger mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QMidiArp&rsquo;s arpeggiators
can run in three modes. &quot;No trigger&quot; will cause
the arp running continuously in synchronization with the
internal or external clock source. Even when new <br>
notes are played, they will be output quantized to the
running queue. &quot;Kbd restart&quot; will cause a reset of
the playhead position upon the next note to be output, but
the output <br>
pattern stays quantized to the queue. When &quot;Kbd
trigger&quot; is selected, each new note played in stakato
will trigger the pattern with the timing of the played
note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing Arp patterns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arp patterns are defined by a
text sequence containing the notes themselves as numbers
along with control changes for chord, tempo, velocity and
octave changes. When the Edit <br>
pattern button in the pattern panel is clicked, the current
pattern preset appears as a text input line. The edited
pattern can be stored in the preset list by clicking on the
<br>
Store pattern button. The currently active pattern can be
removed from the preset list by clicking on the Remove
pattern button. All preset patterns are immediately saved in
the <br>
.qmidiarprc resource file when a pattern is stored or
removed, and the new pattern list is made available to the
other arps in the tab bar. Pattern presets are automatically
<br>
loaded on each application start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for the pattern text
is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0..9 : Note indices <br>
+ : One octave up <br>
- : One octave down <br>
= : Reset to standard octave <br>
&gt; : Double tempo <br>
&lt; : Half tempo <br>
. : Reset to standard tempo <br>
( ) : Chord, begin..end, <br>
e.g. (012) would be a chord of the <br>
lowermost three notes in the buffer <br>
/ : Volume up by 20% &nbsp; <br>
: Volume down by 20% <br>
d : Double length <br>
h : Half length <br>
p : Pause</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any token is valid until the end
of a pattern is reached. The token &gt; will e.g. double the
tempo for all following notes of the pattern. When the loop
jumps back to the begin&acirc; <br>
ning of the pattern, the tempo is reset to its initial
value, i.e. a quarter note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timing, velocity and length
of the output notes can be randomized using the sliders in
the Random panel. These settings can be used to make the
arpeggiator sound less mechan&acirc; <br>
ical, but if they are set to higher values, they add
interesting accents to the patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Envelope</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QMidiArp can modulate the
velocity of the arpeggios with an envelope function defined
by Attack time and Release time. If an attack time is set,
the velocities of the output <br>
notes are ramped up during the attack time defined in
seconds. If a release time is set, notes released from the
keyboard are continued to be output while their velocity is
<br>
ramped down linearly and until the release time has reached
its end. The envelope function only makes sense if the sound
driven by the arp is velocity-sensitive. It works best <br>
with highly polyphonic patterns such as &quot;Chord Oct 16
A&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Groove sliders control a
linear shift of timing, length and velocity within each beat
of the output pattern. This can be used to create swing
timing and accent. The Groove <br>
settings are adjusted for all arps simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LFO Modules <br>
In parallel to the arps, QMidiArp can send MIDI controller
data in form of a low frequency oscillator (LFO) to the
assigned output. The LFO data consist of controller events
that <br>
are in sync with the arpeggiator queue. The queue has to be
in running state to enable the LFO. Each LFO module has a
waveform panel to define the shape of the outgoing data and
<br>
an output panel to define MIDI Channel, ALSA port and
controller number to be produced. The waveform can currently
be set to Sine, Saw Up, Saw Down, Triangle, Square and
Custom. <br>
The frequency of the LFO can be set in muliples and divisors
of the arp tempo, such that frequency of 1 produces one full
wave per beat. If frequencies lower than 1 are selected,
<br>
the length of the wavetable has to be adjusted
correspondingly to produce a full wave. The time resolution
of the LFO determines the number of events produced every
beat and can <br>
be adjusted to up to 192 events per beat. Amplitude and
offset of the waveform can be adjusted from 0...127. Low
resolutions lead to audibly discrete rythmic controller
changes <br>
whereas higher resolution values lead to more continuous
waves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Muting individual wave
points</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual wave points can be
muted/unmuted by clicking on the corresponding location in
the wave display with the right mouse button. A muted wave
point is shown in darker <br>
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom Waveforms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Custom is selected, the
waveform can be drawn with the left mouse button in the
waveform display. A calculated waveform is copied to the
custom waveform whenever it is being <br>
modified by the mouse. This will overwrite the previous
custom waveform with the currently displayed waveform. As
all LFO operations, drawing and muting can be done while the
<br>
queue is running, and becomes effective immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Play direction and looping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The play mode can be switched
between:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&gt;_&gt; : Forward and Loop
<br>
&lt;_&lt;- : Backward and Loop <br>
-&gt;_&lt; : Forward and Bounce <br>
&gt;_&lt;- : Backward and Bounce <br>
-&gt;_| : Forward Single shot <br>
|_&lt;- : Backward Single shot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The direction and loop settings
apply immediately when changed on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recording</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LFO records incoming
controller data as selected in the Input panel, when the
Record button is pressed. Note that the Record button itself
can be attributed to a MIDI toggle <br>
controller so that it provides a convenient implementation
of a controller motion sampler and looper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LFO Input panel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input panel contains
settings on which MIDI CC is to be recorded, how the LFO
acts to note events received on the input. As the
arpeggiators, the LFO can be restarted or <br>
(re-) triggered by notes played on the keyboard, and the
wave output can be stopped or not when Note Off events are
received on the input Channel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LFO Output panel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LFO output panel contains
the port, channel and controller number settings of the LFO
data produced by each LFO tab. You can also mute each LFO
wave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step Sequencer Modules <br>
By clicking Add Step Sequencer... in the control tool bar, a
new Seq module can be added to the tab bar. Each of these
modules produce a simple linear (monophonic) sequence, <br>
similar to the first analog hardware sequencers. The Seq
modules are controllable while running, also in a similar
way to analog step sequencers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programming a sequence</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As QMidiArp&rsquo;s LFO modules,
the step sequencer can be programmed by adjusting notes with
left mouse clicks on the sequence display. The octave range
is fixed to 4. The lowest note <br>
is C2 if the global transpose is set to 0. Notes can be
muted with the right mouse click. The sequence length can be
adjusted between 1 and 8 beats, and the time resolution can
<br>
be set to values between 1 and 16 per beat. A resolution of
4 means that 4 notes are output every beat, i.e. sixteenth
notes. The sequence can also be programmed using the <br>
Record function. When the Record button is pressed, notes
received on the input port will be recorded step-by-step
starting from the last modified note. Programming can be
done <br>
on the fly also when the sequencer queue is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling the sequence
globally</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are sliders to adjust the
global velocity (volume), note length and transpose of the
sequence in semitones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seq Input and Output panels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Seq Input panel determines
how to handle incoming notes on the MIDI Channel set in the
channel box. If Note is checked, the sequence will be
globally transposed with the <br>
incoming note as transpose value. If Velocity is checked in
addition, the sequence will output notes with the same
velocity as that received on its input. The Input panel also
<br>
determines how the sequence behaves when incoming notes are
received. It can be restarted, triggered and stopped with
the timing of received notes as the LFO modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Seq Output panel is
equivalent to that of arpeggiator and LFO modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that accents within a
pattern can be produced by running LFO modules in parallel
to the Seq module, and by sending to the same channel and
port as the Seq module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings <br>
The Settings window allows one to configure if and to which
port incoming events that do not match any module&rsquo;s
input filter are forwarded ( unmatched events). It also
allows one <br>
to set whether incoming controller events are recognized for
muting and controlling the modules separately. If this
option is set, QMidiArp will recognize MIDI control events
<br>
that can be attributed to different parameters (see MIDI
Control ). By checking the compact module style all new
created modules will show with small GUI elements to be more
eco&acirc; <br>
nomic in space when distributed as separate windows over the
desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All settings in this dialog are
stored along with the module data in the qmax session
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIDI control <br>
QMidiArp supports MIDI control events if the Modules
controllable by MIDI CC option is checked in the Settings
dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIDI Learn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controllers can be attributed by
right-clicking on the sliders or mute checkbox in each
module and selecting MIDI Learn. QMidiArp will then wait for
MIDI control events, and <br>
moving a MIDI controller connected to QMidiArp&rsquo;s input
will attribute this controller to the control item. It is
possible to add several MIDI controllers to one item. If
MIDI <br>
Forget is selected, all controllers for that item are
removed. If Cancel MIDI learning is selected, the learn
process is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that by default, mute
controllers are interpreted as toggles, i.e. the mute state
is toggled on reception of a value of 127 from the
attributed controller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control Editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Control Editor is accessible
from the View menu. Controls can be edited by MIDI control
number, channel, and the minimum and maximum values that are
sent to the control item. <br>
Mute controllers have a special behaviour. If minimum and
maximum are equal, the controller acts as toggler upon
reception of the adjusted value. If minimum is different
from <br>
maximum, the corresponding module will be muted upon
reception of minimum and unmuted upon reception of maximum
as values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Remove is pressed, the
currently selected line will be removed, pressing Revert
reloads the current controller settings. Pressing Cancel
quits the control editor without <br>
applying changes, and only if OK is pressed, the edited
control list becomes active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global Storage <br>
There is another dock window available for storing and
restoring most of the parameters of all modules at once. In
this window, each module and its storages appear as a
column, <br>
the first column representing switches for all modules
globally. When the small Store button on the left is
clicked, all modules will store their parameters in a
location given <br>
by the current row, and the next available storage location
appears. Module storages can be recalled by clicking on the
buttons of each individual module or globally (numbered <br>
buttons in the first column). Storage locations can be
removed again by clicking on the &quot;arrow&quot; button on
the bottom of the list. When a new module is added at a time
when stor&acirc; <br>
age locations already exist for other modules, the storage
locations for the new module will be empty and can be filled
by using Store again at this location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When QMidiArp is running, the
switch behavior will depend on the selection made in the
comboboxes in the first row of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End of will cause parameter
switches to occur when the module in the second combobox
reaches its pattern end. When individual switches are done
the module in the column of the <br>
clicked module determines the switch time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After will do parameter switches
at the end of the number of beats selected in the second
combobox after the restore button is clicked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The switch can be done by MIDI
controller assigned by the MIDI Learn context menu of the
top button of each column. Note that it is the the
controller value that corresponds to <br>
the storage location, and that you may want to adjust the
range of controllers to your needs using the MIDI Control
Editor With the Global Storage handler, QMidiArp can act as
a <br>
simple but handy live sequencer tool. But the Golbal Storage
button in the View menu and in the main toolbar toggles
visibility of the Global Storage window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Event Log <br>
The Event Log displays incoming MIDI events. It is displayed
in the bottom area by default, but can be hidden if not
needed or set floating as a top-level window on the desktop.
<br>
Logging can also be disabled generally or for MIDI Clock
events only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example Files <br>
There are currently three demo arpeggios. The demo.qma
arpeggio was intended to be used with the following sound
types: Ch 1: Marimba, Ch 2: Celesta, Ch 3: Acoustic Bass,
but <br>
you can get interesting results if you use other instrument
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The demo_seqlfo.qmax setup shows
the use of the new sequencer and LFO modules playing in
parallel. The sequencer outputs should be routed to
percussive synthesizer sounds. The <br>
LFO data is intended to act on filter cutoff, which has the
standard controller CC#74. ZynAddSubFX by Paul Nasca reacts
on these filter cutoff controllers. The &quot;Bass 1&quot;
and <br>
&quot;Plucked 3&quot; presets from this synthesizer work
well with this demo file.</p>
