<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jgraph - filter for graph plotting to postscript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
jgraph [-p] [-P] [-L] [-comments] [filename ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Jgraph takes the description of a graph or graphs and
produces a postscript file on the standard output. Jgraph is
ideal for plotting any mixture of scatter point graphs, line
<br>
graphs, and/or bar graphs, and embedding the output into
LaTeX, or any other text processing system which can read
postscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jgraph reads its input from the
specified files. If no files are specified, then it reads
from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graph description language
is simple enough to get nice looking graphs with a minimum
of effort, yet powerful enough to give the user the
flexibility to tailor the appearance <br>
of the graph to his or her individual preferences. This
includes plotting multiple graphs and laying them out
separately on the page (or pages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, if the user
wanted to simply plot the points (2,3), (4,5), (1,6), the
following would be enough of a specification file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgraph <br>
newcurve pts 2 3 4 5 1 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if the user wanted to
spruce the graph up by adding labels to the axes, connecting
the points, and titling the graph, then the input could
change to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgraph <br>
newcurve pts 2 3 4 5 1 6 linetype solid <br>
xaxis label : X axis <br>
yaxis label : Y axis <br>
title : This is an example graph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user instead wanted this
to be a bar graph with different endpoints on the axes,
he/she could simply change the input to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgraph <br>
xaxis min 0 max 5 label : X axis <br>
yaxis min 0 max 6 label : Y axis <br>
newcurve pts 2 3 4 5 1 6 marktype xbar <br>
title : This is an example bar graph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many more features of
the description language, which are described below in the
next section. Features which are not embedded within the
description language are: <br>
line and function interpolation, function plotting, and pie
graphs. The latter is impossible to do with the aid of
jgraph, however, the others can be effected with jgraph
mixed <br>
with awk or c. See FUNCTION PLOTTING AND OTHER NON-INHERENT
FEATURES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also below is a section HINTS
AND EXAMPLE GRAPHS, which may give good ideas on how to use
jgraph more effectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-P The -P option produces postscript which can be piped
directly to lpr, which can be displayed in an Xwindows
environment with gs (ghostscript). Without this option, the
<br>
output should be embedded within LaTeX or a similar text
processing system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L The -L option produces a
landscape plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p The -p option re-prints the
input on the standard output, only with all the defaults
made explicit. This is useful for letting the user do
his/her own special formatting, <br>
as it shows the explicit values that the defaults assume, so
that they can be manipulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comments <br>
This option makes jgraph put comments into the output
postscript. These make it easier for the user to wade
through the final postscript if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE <br>
The description language is essentially keywords followed by
attributes. All keywords and attributes except for string
attributes are tokens -- non-white-space characters
sur&acirc; <br>
rounded by white-space. Special tokens are
&lsquo;&lsquo;(*&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;*)&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;include&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;shell&rsquo;&rsquo;, which denote comments,
include-file statements, string identifiers, and <br>
shell-include statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments <br>
Comments are surrounded by the tokens
&lsquo;&lsquo;(*&rsquo;&rsquo;
&lsquo;&lsquo;*)&rsquo;&rsquo; as in Modula-2 (except that
here, the tokens must be surrounded by white-space).
Comments may be nested. If the com&acirc; <br>
ment runs to the end of a file, the last
&lsquo;&lsquo;*)&rsquo;&rsquo; may be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Include-file statements <br>
The token following an &lsquo;&lsquo;include&rsquo;&rsquo;
token is expected to be a file name. The result of the
statement is to include the contents of the file at that
point. Include-file <br>
statements can be nested within included files, and within
shell includes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings <br>
In places where strings are required (as in graph and curve
labels), they are denoted by the token
&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;. The second character after
the &lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo; starts the string, and the
<br>
next newline character terminates it. Thus, the string
&lsquo;&lsquo;Graph #1&rsquo;&rsquo; can be denoted as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: Graph #1&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:&lt;newline&gt; <br>
Graph #1&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can get multiline strings by
making a backslash the last character before the newline on
all but the last line. Notice that in strings white-space is
not ignored. <br>
This way of denoting strings allows the user to embed
leading and trailing spaces, as well as the null string. For
example, the null string &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; is
represented by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: &lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a string has been started,
it may contain any character. Specifically, it may contain
the sequence &lsquo;&lsquo;(*&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;shell&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;include&rsquo;&rsquo; without starting a
comment or <br>
including a file. Each line of a string must contain less
than 1000 characters. Otherwise string sizes are limited
only by the size of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell-include statements <br>
Shell include statements are of the form
&lsquo;&lsquo;shell&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;, and then a string. The result
of the statement is that the string is executed (using
popen, which passes the <br>
string to sh), and the standard output is included at that
point. Shell-includes can be freely nested within
include-files and other shell-includes. Shell commands may
<br>
be more than one line, but must not exceed 1000 characters.
The shell statement is not (yet) available on VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notation <br>
In the descriptions below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tk {integer} <br>
means that token tk must be followed by an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tk [integer] <br>
means that tk may be followed by an integer, but
doesn&rsquo;t have to. In most cases, if tk is not followed
by an integer, then the command denoted by tk is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tk [{integer} {integer}]* <br>
means that tk must be followed by an even number of
integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported types other than
integer are: {float} for floating point entries, {token} for
any token, and {string} for a string as defined above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOP-LEVEL DESCRIPTION
COMMANDS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgraph <br>
This starts editing a new graph (see GRAPH EDITING
COMMANDS). Note that multiple graphs may be drawn on the
same page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">graph {integer} <br>
This edits the graph denoted by {integer}. If the graph
doesn&rsquo;t exist, then this command creates it and starts
editing it. Newgraph is simply an abbreviation for <br>
graph n where n=0 if this is the first graph, otherwise
n=m+1, where m is the largest number of any graph so
far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copygraph [integer] <br>
This creates a new graph, and copies all the attributes from
the graph [integer]&rsquo;s x and y axes, as well as its
x_translate and y_translate values, the clipping, <br>
the legend defaults, and the title defaults. If the
[integer] is omitted, then it copies its values from the
&lsquo;&lsquo;previous&rsquo;&rsquo; graph, which is defined
to be the graph <br>
with the largest number less than the currrent graph&rsquo;s
number. If the current graph has the smallest number, then
it will take the last graph from the previous <br>
page of graphs. If there is no previous page, then an error
will be flagged. (copygraph does not copy the values of the
hash_at, mhash_at, and hash_label <br>
attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newpage <br>
This command is for plotting graphs on multiple pages. After
a newpage, the graphs that the user enters will be plotted
on a new page. New graphs and strings will <br>
be numbered starting with 0. Essentially, newpage is the
same as appending together the output of separate calls of
jgraph on the text before the newpage, and on <br>
the text after the newpage. Newpage will most likely produce
bizarre results if the -P option is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X [float] <br>
Y [float] <br>
Postscript files to be embedded in LaTeX (and some other
programs) contain a &lsquo;&lsquo;bounding box&rsquo;&rsquo;
which defines the area which LaTeX will allocate for the
postscript. <br>
Other programs use this bounding box as well, sometimes
using it to define where to clip the postscript image.
Jgraph uses the axis lines and labels, and the title <br>
to generate its bounding box. Most of the time that&rsquo;s
good enough to work in LaTeX. The Y and X commands say to
make the height and width of the bounding box at <br>
least Y and X inches, respectively, but to maintain the
current centering of the graph. If you still need further
control over the bounding box (e.g. to change the <br>
centering), try the bbox command. If there&rsquo;s more than
one page in the jgraph file, Y, X and bbox values can be
given for each graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bbox float float float float
<br>
If the Y and X commands aren&rsquo;t enough to help you
define a good bounding box, this command lets you explicitly
enter one which will go directly into the jgraph out&acirc;
<br>
put. Its units are the final postscript units. It&rsquo;s
probably best to use the -p option to see what the bounding
box is that jgraph produces, and then alter that <br>
accordingly with bbox. The main use for this is to change
the automatic centering that jgraph performs: Usually the
center of the bounding box that jgraph com&acirc; <br>
putes is put at the center of the page. Changing the bbox
changes this center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preamble : {string} <br>
preamble {token} <br>
epilogue : {string} <br>
epilogue {token} <br>
These two commands allow the user to include strings or
files (the token specifies the filename) which will be
copied directly into jgraph&rsquo;s output. The preamble
<br>
is included at the beginning of the output (after some
initial postscript to set things up for jgraph), and the
epilogue is included at the end. A good use for the <br>
preamble is to set up a postscript dictionary if
you&rsquo;re using postscript marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPH EDITING COMMANDS <br>
These commands act on the current graph. Graph editing is
terminated when one of the top-level description commands is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xaxis <br>
yaxis Edit the x or y axis (see AXIS EDITING COMMANDS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newcurve <br>
This starts editing a new curve of the graph (see CURVE
EDITING COMMANDS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curve {integer} <br>
This edits the curve denoted by {integer}. If the curve
doesn&rsquo;t exist, then this command creates it and starts
editing it. Newcurve and curve interact as newgraph <br>
and graph do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newline <br>
This is an abbreviation for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newcurve marktype none linetype
solid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copycurve [integer] <br>
This starts editing a new curve of the graph, and copies all
its values except for the points from curve [integer.] If
the [integer] is omitted, then it copies its <br>
values from the last curve in this graph. If this graph
currently has no curves, then it searches backwards from the
previous graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title This edits the title of
the graph (see LABEL EDITING COMMANDS). The title is given a
default location centered beneath the graph, and a default
font size of 12, <br>
however, as with all labels, this can be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">legend This edits the legend of
the graph (see LEGEND EDITING COMMANDS). As a default, the
graph will contain a legend if any of its curves have
labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newstring <br>
This edits a new text string (see LABEL EDITING COMMANDS).
This is useful as it allows the user to plot text on the
graph as well as curves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string {integer} <br>
copystring [integer] <br>
String and copystring are to newstring as curve and
copycurve are to newcurve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">border <br>
noborder <br>
Border draws a square border around the area defined by the
axes. Noborder specifies no border. Noborder is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clip <br>
noclip Clip specifies that all curves in the graph will be
clipped -- that is, no points outside of the axes will be
plotted. Clipping can also be specified on a <br>
per-curve basis. The default is noclip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inherit_axes <br>
This is an old command which is kept for backward
compatibility. Copycurve. is equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgraph inherit_axes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x_translate [float] <br>
y_translate [float] <br>
By default, the bottom left-hand corner of each graph is at
point (0,0) (final postscript units). X_translate and
Y_translate translate the bottom left-hand corner <br>
of the graph [float] inches. The main use of this is to draw
more than one graph on a page. Note that jgraph considers
all the graphs drawn on the page when it <br>
computes its bounding box for centering. Thus, if only one
graph is drawn, it will always be centered on the page,
regardless of its X_translate and Y_translate <br>
values. These values are used for relative placement of the
graphs. <br>
To change the centering of the graphs, use bbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X [float] <br>
Y [float] <br>
These are the same as X and Y in the Top-level commands,
except that they let the user continue editing the current
graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE AXIS EDITING COMMANDS
<br>
These commands act on the current axis as chosen by xaxis or
yaxis (see GRAPH EDITING COMMANDS). Axis editing terminates
when a graph or top-level command is given. <br>
There are more advanced axis editing commands given below
which have to do with moving the hash marks, adding new hash
marks and labels, etc. See ADVANCED AXIS EDITING <br>
COMMANDS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linear <br>
log Set the axis to be linear or logarithmic. The default is
linear. If the axis is set to be logarithmic, then values
&lt;= 0.0 will be disallowed, as they are at nega&acirc;
<br>
tive infinity on the axis. If you are using logarithmic axes
and the labels shows 0 0 1 10 instead of 0.01 0.1 1 10, then
you should read &quot;hash_format&quot; in this sec&acirc;
<br>
tion. Hint: xaxis log hash_format g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min [float] <br>
max [float] <br>
Set the minimum and maximum values of this axis. Defaults
depend on the points given. They can be seen by using the -p
option. Unless stated, all units (for <br>
example point plotting, string plotting, etc.) will be in
terms of the min and max values of the x and y axes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size [float] <br>
Set the size of this axis in inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_base [float] <br>
Set the base of the logarithmic axis. Default = 10. This is
the value which determines which hash marks and hash labels
are automatically produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash [float] <br>
Hash marks will be [float] units apart. Default = -1. If
this value equals 0, then there will be no hash marks. If
this value is less than 0, then the hash marks <br>
will be automatically set by jgraph (see -p for the value).
By default, each hash mark will be labeled with its value.
Hash and shash are ignored if the axes are <br>
logarithmic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shash [float] <br>
Make sure there is a hash mark at the point [float] along
the axis. The default is set by jgraph if hash = -1. If hash
is set by the user, shash is defaulted to <br>
the min value of the axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mhash [integer] <br>
Put [integer] minor hash marks between the above hash marks.
Default = -1. If this value equals 0, then there will be no
minor hash marks. If this value is nega&acirc; <br>
tive, then the value will be chosen by jgraph (see -p for
the value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">precision [integer]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_format token <br>
These control how jgraph formats the automatic hash labels.
The user shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about these values,
except in extreme cases. Jgraph uses printf to <br>
format the labels. If hash_format is
&lsquo;&lsquo;f&rsquo;&rsquo; (the default), then the value
of a hash label is printed with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf(&quot;%.*f&quot;,
precision, value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other valid hash_format values
are &lsquo;&lsquo;G&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;g&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;e&rsquo;&rsquo;. &lsquo;&lsquo;G&rsquo;&rsquo;
is a good generic format which converts to scientific
notation if the value becomes too big or <br>
too small. If the precision is negative, then jgraph chooses
a default: For &lsquo;&lsquo;g&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;G&rsquo;&rsquo;, the default is 6. For
&lsquo;&lsquo;e&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo;&rsquo;, the default is 0, and for
&lsquo;&lsquo;f&rsquo;&rsquo;, <br>
jgraph tries to determine a reasonable default. Please read
the man page of prinf(1) for a complete description of how
it formats floating point numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label Edit the label of this
axis (see LABEL EDITING COMMANDS). By default, the label is
in font &lsquo;&lsquo;Times-Bold&rsquo;&rsquo;, and has a
font size of 10. If the user doesn&rsquo;t change <br>
any of the plotting attributes of the label, jgraph chooses
an appropriate place for the axis label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_at [float] <br>
Draw the axis line at this point on the other axis. The
default is usually the other axis&rsquo;s min, however if
hash_scale is positive (see hash_scale under ADVANCED <br>
AXIS EDITING), it will be the other axis&rsquo;s max.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodraw Do not draw the axis, the
hash marks or any labels. This is useful for plotting points
with no axes, and for overlaying graphs on top of one
another with no <br>
clashes. This is equivalent to no_draw_axis,
no_draw_axis_label, no_draw_hash_marks, and
no_draw_hash_labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw Cancels the effect of
nodraw. Default = draw This is equivalent to draw_axis,
draw_axis_label, draw_hash_marks, and draw_hash_labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grid_lines <br>
no_grid_lines <br>
Grid_lines specifies to plot a grid line at each major hash
mark on this axis. The default is no_grid_lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mgrid_lines <br>
no_mgrid_lines <br>
Mgrid_lines specifies to plot a grid line at each minor hash
mark on this axis. The default is no_mgrid_lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CURVE EDITING COMMANDS <br>
These commands act on the current curve as chosen by
newcurve or curve (see GRAPH EDITING COMMANDS). Curve
editing terminates when a graph or top-level command is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pts [{float} {float}]* <br>
This sets the points to plot in this curve. The first float
is the x value, and the second float is the y value of the
point. Points are plotted in the order <br>
specified. This command stops reading points when a
non-float is given. The user can specify this command
multiple times within a curve -- each time, simply more <br>
points are added to the curve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x_epts [{float} {float} {float}
{float}]* <br>
y_epts [{float} {float} {float} {float}]* <br>
This allows the user to specify points and
&lsquo;&lsquo;confidence values&rsquo;&rsquo; (otherwise
known as &lsquo;&lsquo;error bars&rsquo;&rsquo;). The first
two floats specify the x and y values of the point, <br>
as above. If x_epts is specified, then the second two floats
specify range or confidence values for the x value of the
point. Error bars will be printed to each <br>
of these x values (using the original point&rsquo;s y value)
from the original point. Similarly, y_epts specifies range
or confidence values for the y value of the <br>
point. pts x_epts and y_epts can all be intermixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marktype <br>
This sets the kind of mark that is plotted for this curve.
Valid marks are: circle, box, diamond, triangle, x, cross,
ellipse, xbar, ybar, text, postscript, eps, <br>
none, and variants of general. Most of these are
self-explanatory, except for the last few: <br>
Xbar makes the curve into a bar graph with the bars going to
the x axis. Ybar has the bars going to the y axis. <br>
Text lets the user plot text instead of a mark. The text is
edited as a label (see LABEL EDITING COMMANDS) immediately
following the text command. The x and y <br>
fields of the label have special meanings here: They define
where the label is to be printed in relation to the curve
points. For example, if they are both 0, the <br>
label will be printed directly on the curve points. If x is
1.0 and y is -1.0, then the label will be printed one unit
to the right and one unit below the curve <br>
points (units are units of the x and y axes). Default label
values are 0 for x and y, and center justification. <br>
Postscript: See the postscript token below. <br>
Eps: See the eps token below. <br>
None means that no mark will be plotted (this is useful for
drawing lines). <br>
There are four types of general marks, which work using the
gmarks command described below. The four marktypes are
general, general_nf, general_bez, and gen&acirc; <br>
eral_bez_nf. <br>
By default, a new mark is chosen for each curve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marksize [float] [float] <br>
This sets the size of the mark. The first [float] is the
width of the mark, and the second is the height. Units are
those of the x and y axes respectively, unless <br>
that axis is logarithmic, in which case the units are
inches. Negative marksizes are allowed (e.g. a negative
height will flip a triangle mark). The default mark <br>
size can be determined using the -p option of jgraph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mrotate [float] <br>
This allows the user to rotate the mark [float] degrees.
Default is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gray [float] <br>
color [float float float] <br>
These specify either the grayness of the curve or its color.
Values for gray should be from 0 (black) to 1 (white).
Values for color should also be from 0 to 1. <br>
They are RGB values, and thus define the amount of red,
green and blue in the curve respectively. Specifying color
nullifies the gray value, and vice versa. The <br>
default is gray 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fill [float] <br>
cfill [float float float] <br>
This sets the filling of marks which define an area to fill
(e.g. box, circle, xbar). fill defines a gray value, and
cfill defines a color value (see gray and <br>
color above for a description of the units). The default is
fill 0 (black).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern token [float] <br>
This defines the how the mark is to be filled. Token may be
solid (the default), stripe, or estripe. If solid, then the
float is ignored, and the mark is com&acirc; <br>
pletely filled in with either the gray value defined by fill
or the color value defined by cfill. If stripe, then the
mark will be filled with stripes of either <br>
the gray value defined by fill or the color defined by
cfill. The stripes will be rotated by float degrees. Estripe
differs from stripe only in that stripe draws <br>
stripes on a white background, while estripe simply draws
the stripes on an empty background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">poly <br>
nopoly <br>
pfill [float] <br>
pcfill [float float float] <br>
ppattern token [float] <br>
Poly allows the user to make jgraph treat the curve as a
closed polygon (or in the case of a bezier, a closed bezier
curve). pfill, pcfill and ppattern specify <br>
the filling of the polygon, and work like fill, cfill and
pattern above. The default is nopoly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmarks [{float} {float}]* <br>
Gmarks is a way for the user to define custom marks. For
each mark on (x,y), Each pair of {float_x}, {float_y}, will
define a point on the mark (x + (float_x * <br>
marksize_x / 2), y + (float_y * marksize_y / 2)). <br>
Thus, for example, the box mark could be defined as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmarks -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1 -1 <br>
marktype general</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The marktypes general,
general_nf, general_bez, and general_bez_nf, allow the
gmarks points to define a closed polygon, a line, a closed
bezier curve and a regular bezier <br>
curve respectively (the &lsquo;&lsquo;nf&rsquo;&rsquo;
stands for &lsquo;&lsquo;non-filled&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postscript : {string} <br>
postscript {token} <br>
This allows the user to enter direct postscript as a mark.
It automatically sets the marktype to postscript. If a
string is entered, then that string is used as <br>
the mark in the jgraph output. If a token is entered, then
that token must stand for a filename, which will be copied
to the output once for every mark. The post&acirc; <br>
script will be set up so that when the string or file is put
to the output, (0, 0) of the the axes is in the middle of
the mark, it is rotated by mrotate degrees, <br>
and scaled by (marksize_x / 2), marksize_y / 2). Thus, the
box mark could be defined as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postscript : 1 setlinewidth -1
-1 moveto -1 1 lineto 1 1 lineto 1 -1 lineto -1 -1 lineto
stroke</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the marksize_x is defined to
be (0, 0), then jgraph does no scaling. This is useful when
the postscript has strings, and the user does not want the
strings to be <br>
scaled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eps {token} <br>
This allows the user to include an encapsulated postscript
file and treat it as a mark. It automatically sets the
marktype to eps. The file will be scaled so that <br>
the bounding box is marksize units. Among other things, this
allows the user to include whole jgraph files as marks.
Please see ad.jgr, explained in HINTS AND <br>
EXAMPLE GRAPHS below for an example of this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">larrows <br>
rarrows <br>
nolarrows <br>
norarrows <br>
Rarrows specifies to draw an arrow at the end of every line
segment in the curve. Larrows specifies to draw an arrow at
the beginning of every line segment. The <br>
size of the arrows can be changed by using asize. The
default is nolarrows and norarrows. <br>
Arrows always go exactly to the point specified, with the
exception of when the marktype is
&lsquo;&lsquo;circle&rsquo;&rsquo;. In this case, the arrow
goes to the edge of the circle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">larrow <br>
rarrow <br>
nolarrow <br>
norarrow <br>
This is analgous to the above, except that with larrow, the
only arrow drawn is to the beginning of the first segment in
the curve, and with rarrow, the only arrow <br>
drawn is to the end of the last segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asize [float] [float] <br>
This sets the size of the arrows. The first [float] controls
the arrow&rsquo;s width. Its units are those of the x-axis.
The second [float] controls the arrow&rsquo;s <br>
height. It is in the units of the y-axis. Use the -p option
of jgraph to see the default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afill [float] <br>
afill [float] <br>
apattern token [float] <br>
These control the grayness or color of arrowheads. Afill,
acfill and apattern work in the same way as fill, cfill and
pattern described above. The default is <br>
afill 0 (black).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linetype [token] <br>
This defines the type of the line connecting the points.
Valid entries are solid, dotted, dashed, longdash, dotdash,
dotdotdash, dotdotdashdash, general, and none. <br>
The default is none. General lets the user define his own
linetype using the glines command described below. Points
are connected in the order in which they are <br>
inserted using the pts command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glines [float]* <br>
This lets the user specify the exact dashing of a line. The
format is as in postscript -- the first number is the length
of the first dash, the second is the <br>
length of the space after the first dash, etc. For example,
dotdash could be defined as &lsquo;&lsquo;glines 5 3 1
3&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linethickness [float] <br>
This defines the line thickness (in absolute postscript
units) of the connecting line. Default = 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bezier <br>
nobezier <br>
Bezier specifies to use the curve&rsquo;s points to define
successive bezier curves. The first point is the starting
point. The next two are control points for the <br>
bezier curve and the next point is the ending point. If
there is another bezier, this ending point is also the
beginning point of the next curve. The next two <br>
points are again control points, and the next point is the
ending point. Thus, a bezier must have a total of (3n + 1)
points, where n is at least 1. <br>
In bezier curves, marks and arrows only apply to every third
point. Nobezier is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clip This specifies that this
curve will be clipped -- that is, no points outside of the
of axes will be plotted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noclip This turns off clipping.
If clipping was specified for the entire graph, then noclip
has no effect. Noclip is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label This edits the label of
this curve for the purpose of drawing a legend. (see LABEL
EDITING COMMANDS and LEGEND EDITING COMMANDS). Unless the
legend entry is cus&acirc; <br>
tom, setting any label attribute except for the text itself
will have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LABEL EDITING COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are used for editing labels. Unless
stated otherwise, the defaults are written with each
command. Label editing terminates when one of these <br>
tokens is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: {string} <br>
This sets the string of the label. If no string is set, the
label will not be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x [float] <br>
y [float] <br>
This sets the x or y coordinate of the label. Units are the
units of the x and y axes respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font [token] <br>
This sets the font. Default is usually
&lsquo;&lsquo;Times-Roman&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fontsize [float] <br>
This sets the fontsize in points. Default is usually 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linesep [float] <br>
This sets the distance between lines in multilined labels.
Units are points. The default is the fontsize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hjl <br>
hjc <br>
hjr These set the horizontal justification to left, center,
and right, respectively. Default = hjc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vjt <br>
vjc <br>
vjb These set the vertical justification to top center, and
bottom, respectively. Default = vjb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate [float] <br>
This will rotate the string [float] degrees. The point of
rotation is defined by the vj and hj commands. For example,
to rotate 90 degrees about the center of a <br>
string, one would use vjc hjc rotate 90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgray [float] <br>
lcolor [float float float] <br>
These control the color or the grayness of the label. It
works just as gray and color do for curves and axes. The
default depends on the context. For example, <br>
for strings and the title, the default is black. For axis
labels and hash labels, the default is the color of the
axis. For text as marks, the default is the <br>
curve color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEGEND EDITING COMMANDS <br>
These commands allow the user to alter the appearance of the
legend. Legends are printed out for each curve having a
non-null label. The legend entries are printed out <br>
in the order of ascending curve numbers. Legend editing
terminates when a graph command or top level command is
issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In earlier versions of jgraph
(before version 8.0), the characteristics of each legend
entry were set in the label portion of the entry&rsquo;s
curve. Thus, for example, if you <br>
wanted each entry&rsquo;s fontsize to be 18, you had to set
it in each entry&rsquo;s curve. Now, default legend entry
characteristics are set using the defaults keyword. Unless a
<br>
custom legend is specified, these default values override
any values set in the entry&rsquo;s curve. Thus, to get all
entries to have a fontsize of 18, it must be set using <br>
defaults fontsize 18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If legend editing seems cryptic,
try the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgraph <br>
newcurve marktype box linetype solid label : Solid box <br>
pts 0 0 1 1 2 1 3 1 <br>
newcurve marktype circle linetype dotted label : Dotted
circle <br>
pts 0 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 <br>
newcurve marktype x linetype dashed label : Dashed x <br>
pts 0 2 1 3 2 3 3 3 <br>
legend defaults <br>
font Times-Italic fontsize 14 x 1.5 y 3.5 hjc vjb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The legend of this graph should
be centered over the top of the graph, and all legend
entries should be 14pt Times-Italic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on <br>
off These turn printing of the legend on and off. The
default is on (but, of course, if there are no curve labels
defined, there will be no legend).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linelength [float] <br>
This sets the length of the line printed in front of legend
entries corresponding to curves which have lines. Units are
those of the x axis, unless the x axis is <br>
logarithmic, in which case the units are inches. The default
may be gotten using the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linebreak [float] <br>
This sets the vertical distance between individual legend
entries. Units are those of the y axis, unless the y axis is
logarithmic, in which case the units are <br>
inches. The default may be gotten using the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">midspace [float] <br>
This sets one of two things. If any of the legend entries
have lines in them, then this sets the distance between the
end of the line and the legend entry text. <br>
Otherwise, this sets the distance between center of the mark
and the legend entry text. Units are those of the x axis,
unless the x axis is logarithmic, in which <br>
case the units are inches. The default may be gotten using
the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaults <br>
This lets the user change the attributes of all legend
entries. The defaults are edited as a label (see LABEL
EDITING COMMANDS). A few of the label fields have <br>
special meanings: The : field is ignored. The x and y fields
define where the label will be printed. The hj and vj fields
define the justification of the legend <br>
about the x and y point. Thus, if x is 10 and y is 15, and
hjc vjb are specified, then the legend will be centered
horizontally about x=10, and the bottom of the <br>
legend will be placed on y=15. This is analagous to label
plotting. The rotate field is also analagous to label
plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults are as follows. Rotate
is 0. font is &lsquo;&lsquo;Times-Roman&rsquo;&rsquo; and
fontsize is 9. The color is black. Default justification is
hjl and vjc. The default x and y <br>
values are set according to the hj and vj fields. See the -p
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left <br>
right These will automatically produce a legend to the left
or the right of the graph. Left is equivalent to defaults
hjr vjc and right is equivalent to defaults hjl <br>
vjc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">top <br>
bottom These will automatically produce a legend on the top
or the bottom of the graph. Top is equivalent to defaults
hjl vjb <br>
and bottom is equivalent to defaults hjl vjt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x [float] <br>
y [float] <br>
These are included mainly for backward compatability to
earlier versions of jgraph. Setting x and y is equivalent to
&lsquo;&lsquo;defaults x float y float hjl
vjt&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">custom This lets the user
control where each individual legend entry goes. The values
of the defaults fields are ignored, and instead, the values
of the curve&rsquo;s labels <br>
are used. All justifications have defined results, except
for hjc. Similarly, rotation other than 0 is likely to
produce bad effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED AXIS EDITING <br>
These are more advanced commands for editing an axis. This
includes drawing explicit hash marks and labels, moving the
hash marks, axes, and labels, not drawing the hash <br>
marks, labels, axes, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gray [float] <br>
color [float float float] <br>
These specify either the grayness of the axis or its color.
Values for gray should be from 0 (black) to 1 (white).
Values for color should also be from 0 to 1. <br>
They are RGB values, and thus define the amount of red,
green and blue in the axis respectively. Specifying color
nullifies the gray value, and vice versa. The <br>
default is gray 0. These values affect every part of the
axis: the label, the hash marks and labels, the axis line
and the grid lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grid_gray [float] <br>
grid_color [float float float] <br>
mgrid_gray [float] <br>
mgrid_color [float float float] <br>
These allow the user to define the grayness or color of the
gridlines and the mgridlines to be different from those of
the axis lines. The default grid_gray and <br>
grid_color is the same as the axis&rsquo;s gray and color.
The default mgrid_gray and mgrid_color is the same as
grid_gray and grid_color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_at [float] <br>
Draw a hash mark at this point. No label is made for this
hash mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mhash_at [float] <br>
Draw a minor hash mark at this point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_label <br>
Edit a hash label (see HASH LABEL EDITING COMMANDS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_labels <br>
Edit the default characteristics of the hash labels. This is
so that the user can change the fontsize, justification,
etc., of the hash labels. Editing <br>
hash_labels is just like editing normal labels (see LABEL
EDITING COMMANDS), except that the :, x, and y values are
all ignored. Defaults for hash labels are as <br>
follows: Fontsize=9,
Font=&lsquo;&lsquo;Times-Roman&rsquo;&rsquo;, Justification
is dependent on whether it is the x or y axis and whether
hash_scale is positive or negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_scale [float] <br>
This is to change the size and orientation of the hash
marks. Default = -1.0. Changing this to -2.0 will double the
length of the hash marks. Changing this to <br>
+1.0 will make the hash marks come above or to the right of
the axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_hash_marks_at [float] <br>
By default, the hash marks are drawn either above or below
the axis. This command changes where they are drawn.
Hash_scale still determines whether they are drawn <br>
above or below this point, and their size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_hash_labels_at [float] <br>
By default, the hash labels are drawn either above or below
the hash marks (again, this is dependent on hash_scale).
This command changes where they are drawn. <br>
Justification and fontsize, etc., can be changed with the
hash_labels command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_hash_marks <br>
no_auto_hash_marks <br>
This toggles whether or not jgraph will automatically create
hash marks according to hash, mhash and shash (or log_base
and mhash for logarithmic axes). The <br>
default is auto_hash_marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto_hash_labels <br>
no_auto_hash_labels <br>
This toggles whether or not jgraph will automatically create
hash labels for the auto_hash_marks. Default =
auto_hash_labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_axis <br>
no_draw_axis <br>
This toggles whether or not the axis line is drawn. Default
= draw_axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_axis_label <br>
no_draw_axis_label <br>
This toggles whether or not the axis label (as edited by the
label command) is drawn. Default = draw_axis_label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_hash_marks <br>
no_draw_hash_marks <br>
This toggles whether or not the hash marks (both automatic
and those created with hash_at and mhash_at) are drawn.
Default = draw_hash_marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draw_hash_labels <br>
no_draw_hash_labels <br>
This toggles whether or not the hash labels are drawn.
Default = draw_hash_labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HASH LABEL EDITING COMMANDS <br>
Hash labels are simply strings printed along the appropriate
axis. As a default, they are printed at the place denoted by
the most recent hash_at or mhash_at for this <br>
axis, but this can be changed by the at command. If there
has been no hash_at or mhash_at, then an at command must be
given, or there will be an error. Hash editing ter&acirc;
<br>
minates when either one of these commands is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: {string} <br>
This sets the string of the hash label (see Strings above
under THE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at [float] <br>
This sets the location of the hash label along the current
axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTION PLOTTING AND OTHER
NON-INHERENT FEATURES <br>
Although jgraph doesn&rsquo;t have any built-in functions
for interpolation or function plotting, both can be effected
in jgraph with a little outside help:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function plotting <br>
With the include and shell statement, it&rsquo;s easy to
create a file of points of a function with a c or awk
program, and include it into a graph. See the section HINTS
AND <br>
EXAMPLE GRAPHS for an example of a sin graph produced in
this manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Point interpolation <br>
Point interpolation is essentially the same as function
plotting, and therefore is left out of jgraph. The UNIX
spline(1) routine is a simple way to get interpolation <br>
between points. See bailey.jgr described below. Maybe in a
future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS AND EXAMPLE GRAPHS <br>
Jgraph should be able to draw any kind of scatter/line/bar
graph that a user desires. To embellish the graph with extra
text, axes, lines, etc., it is helpful to use copygraph.
<br>
The following example graphs show a few examples of
different features of jgraph. They should be in the
directory /usr/share/doc/examples/jgraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- acc.jgr is a simple bar graph.
Acc.tex is also included to show how one can include the
output of jgraph in a LaTeX file. To get this to work, you
might have to substitute <br>
the entire pathname of the file acc.jps in the acc.tex
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- g8.jgr is a simple graph with
some plotted text. - g8col.jgr shows how to produce a color
background -- it is <br>
the same as g8.jgr only all on a yellow background. -
ebars.jgr is a simple graph with error bars. - sin.jgr shows
how a sin function can be plotted using a simple c program
<br>
to produce the sin wave. Moreover, this file shows a use of
copygraph to plot an extra x and y axis at the 0 point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- sin1.jgr is a further
extension of sin.jgr only with one x and y axis at 0, but
with the axis labels at the left and the bottom of the
graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- sin2.jgr is a different sin
wave with a logarithmic x axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- sin3.jgr shows how a bizarre
effect can be gotten by sorting the points in a different
manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- bailey.jgr shows how to use
the UNIX spline(1) routine to get interpolation between
points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- gpaper.jgr shows how you can
get jgraph to easily produce graph paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- g9n10.jgr contains two graphs
with complicated legends. It contains a description of how
the legend was created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- ex1.jgr and ex2.jgr are two
examples which were figures 1 and two in an extended
abstract for a paper about jgraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- mab2.jgr is a graph created by
Matt Blaze which shows how a complicated output graph can be
quite concisely and simply stated. In this graph, the x axis
is a time line. It <br>
shows usage of the hash_label and hash_labels commands, as
well as displaying how jgraph lets you extract data from
output files with awk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- nr.jgr is an example of a
rather complicated bar graph with stripe-filled bars. It was
created by Norman Ramsey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- hypercube.jgr shows an
interesting use of jgraph for picture-drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- ad.jgr is an example which
shows how one can include jgraph output as jgraph input. The
file uses the eps token to include cube.jgr, a jgraph
drawing of an Intel hypercube, <br>
and disk.jgr, a jgraph drawing of a disk, in a picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- alb.jgr is another use of
jgraph for picture drawing. This file was created by an awk
script which Adam Buchsbaum wrote to draw trees and
graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- wortman.jgr is a neat graph of
processor utilization written by Dave Wortman for SIGPLAN
&rsquo;92. It was created by an awk script, which processed
the data and emitted the jgraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view these graphs, use jgraph
-P, and view the resulting output file with gs, or a similar
postscript viewer. To make a hard copy of these graphs, pipe
the output of jgraph <br>
-P directly to lpr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING JGRAPH TO DRAW PICTURES
<br>
As hypercube.jgr and alb.jgr show, jgraph can be used as a
postscript preprocessor to make drawings. There are two
advantages using jgraph to draw pictures instead of using
<br>
standard drawing tools like xfig, figtool, or idraw. The
first is that with jgraph, you know exactly where strings,
lines, boxes, etc, will end up, because you plot them
explic&acirc; <br>
itly. The second advantage is that for iterative drawings,
with lots of patterns, you can combine jgraph with awk or c
or any other programming language to get complex output in
<br>
a simple way. Most what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG)
drawing tools cannot do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The major disadvantage of using
jgraph to draw pictures is that jgraph is not WYSIWYG. You
have to set up axes and plot points, lines and strings.
It&rsquo;s all a matter of taste.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;d like to see some
more complex pictures drawn with jgraph, as well as some
hints to make picture-drawing easier, send me email
(plank@cs.utk.edu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORT FOR OTHER FONT ENCODINGS
<br>
If you want to use non-english characters to set labels or
titles, set enviroment variable JGRAPH_ENCODING with the
font encoding that you need. This value will be passed <br>
directly to the postscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ex. to use ISO-8859-1
characters, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
JGRAPH_ENCODING=ISOLatin1Encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: that only works with
default fonts. if you use &rsquo;font&rsquo; in stdin to
specify another font, it won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also have the possibility to
expand the bounding box if jgraph cuts some acute, tilde or
special chars near the border; try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export JGRAPH_BORDER=5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This support is currently
&rsquo;testing&rsquo; code. Send bugs about it to
pzn@debian.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">includegraphics[width=7cm]{a.eps}
<br>
or <br>
includegraphics[height=7cm]{a.eps}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you can also omit the .eps/.pdf
suffix: <br>
includegraphics[height=7cm]{a}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a.eps and a.pdf can both exist,
and includegraphics will automatically choose the correct
one for postscript or pdf output, depending if you are using
latex of pdflatex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATION USING MAKE <br>
You can automate the mapping from .jgr -&gt; .eps or .jgr
-&gt; .pdf in your Makefile using these rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--------- cut here ---------
<br>
%.eps : %.jgr <br>
jgraph $&lt; &gt; $@ <br>
%.pdf : %.jgr <br>
jgraph $&lt; | epstopdf --filter &gt; $@ <br>
--------- cut here ---------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jgraph can also return the exit
status correctly, so it is also a good idea to use it in
your scripts to prevent bad .eps files if the .jgr source is
bad. The following Makefile <br>
can handle its exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--------- cut here ---------
<br>
%.eps : %.jgr <br>
jgraph $&lt; &gt; $@; if [ &quot;$$?&quot; != &quot;0&quot;
]; then rm -f $@; exit 1; fi <br>
%.pdf : %.jgr <br>
TMP=&lsquo;tempfile&lsquo;; jgraph $&lt; &gt; $${TMP}; if [
&quot;$$?&quot; == &quot;0&quot; ]; then cat $${TMP} |
epstopdf --filter &gt; $@; rm -f $${TMP}; else rm -f $${TMP}
$@; exit 1; fi; <br>
--------- cut here ---------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Logarithmic axes cannot contain points &lt;= 0. If I have
enough complaints to convince me that this is a bug,
I&rsquo;ll try to fix it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no real way to make the
axes such that they decrease from left to right or low to
high -- or at least not without writing your own hash
labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There may well be loads of other
bugs. Send to plank@cs.utk.edu.</p>
