<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
background - manage terminal background</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
urxvt --background-expr &rsquo;background expression&rsquo;
<br>
--background-border <br>
--background-interval seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK AND DIRTY CHEAT SHEET <br>
Just load a random jpeg image and tile the background with
it without scaling or anything else:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load
&quot;/path/to/img.jpg&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same, but use
mirroring/reflection instead of tiling:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirror load
&quot;/path/to/img.jpg&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load an image and scale it to
exactly fill the terminal window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale keep { load
&quot;/path/to/img.jpg&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implement pseudo-transparency by
using a suitably-aligned root pixmap as window
background:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, but keep a blurred
copy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign keep { blur 10, root
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This extension manages the terminal background by creating a
picture that is behind the text, replacing the normal
background colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It does so by evaluating a Perl
expression that calculates the image on the fly, for
example, by grabbing the root background or loading a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the full power of Perl is
available, the operators have been design to be as simple as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to load an image
and scale it to the window size, you would use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">urxvt --background-expr
&rsquo;scale keep { load &quot;/path/to/mybg.png&quot;
}&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or specified as a X
resource:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URxvt.background.expr: scale
keep { load &quot;/path/to/mybg.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEORY OF OPERATION <br>
At startup, just before the window is mapped for the first
time, the expression is evaluated and must yield an image.
The image is then extended as necessary to cover the whole
<br>
terminal window, and is set as a background pixmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the image contains an alpha
channel, then it will be used as-is in visuals that support
alpha channels (for example, for a compositing manager). In
other visuals, the terminal <br>
background colour will be used to replace any
transparency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the expression relies,
directly or indirectly, on the window size, position, the
root pixmap, or a timer, then it will be remembered. If not,
then it will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the parameters that
the expression relies on changes (when the window is moved
or resized, its position or size changes; when the root
pixmap is replaced by another one <br>
the root background changes; or when the timer elapses),
then the expression will be evaluated again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, an expression such
as &quot;scale keep { load &quot;$HOME/mybg.png&quot;
}&quot; scales the image to the window size, so it relies on
the window size and will be reevaluated each time <br>
it is changed, but not when it moves for example. That
ensures that the picture always fills the terminal, even
after its size changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPRESSIONS <br>
Expressions are normal Perl expressions, in fact, they are
Perl blocks - which means you could use multiple lines and
statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale keep { <br>
again 3600; <br>
if (localtime now)[6]) { <br>
return load &quot;$HOME/weekday.png&quot;; <br>
} else { <br>
return load &quot;$HOME/sunday.png&quot;; <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This inner expression is
evaluated once per hour (and whenever the terminal window is
resized). It sets sunday.png as background on Sundays, and
weekday.png on all other days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, we expect that most
expressions will be much simpler, with little Perl knowledge
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basically, you always start with
a function that &quot;generates&quot; an image object, such
as &quot;load&quot;, which loads an image from disk, or
&quot;root&quot;, which returns the root window background
<br>
image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path is usually specified as
a quoted string (the exact rules can be found in the perlop
manpage). The $HOME at the beginning of the string is
expanded to the home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you prepend one or more
modifiers or filtering expressions, such as
&quot;scale&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just like a mathematical
expression with functions, you should read these expressions
from right to left, as the &quot;load&quot; is evaluated
first, and its result becomes the argument to <br>
the &quot;scale&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many operators also allow some
parameters preceding the input image that modify its
behaviour. For example, &quot;scale&quot; without any
additional arguments scales the image to size of <br>
the terminal window. If you specify an additional argument,
it uses it as a scale factor (multiply by 100 to get a
percentage):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale 2, load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enlarges the image by a
factor of 2 (200%). As you can see, &quot;scale&quot; has
now two arguments, the 200 and the &quot;load&quot;
expression, while &quot;load&quot; only has one argument.
Arguments <br>
are separated from each other by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scale also accepts two
arguments, which are then separate factors for both
horizontal and vertical dimensions. For example, this halves
the image width and doubles the image <br>
height:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale 0.5, 2, load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IF you try out these
expressions, you might suffer from some sluggishness,
because each time the terminal is resized, it loads the PNG
image again and scales it. Scaling is <br>
usually fast (and unavoidable), but loading the image can be
quite time consuming. This is where &quot;keep&quot; comes
in handy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale 0.5, 2, keep { load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;keep&quot; operator
executes all the statements inside the braces only once, or
when it thinks the outcome might change. In other cases it
returns the last value computed by the <br>
brace block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that the
&quot;load&quot; is only executed once, which makes it much
faster, but also means that more memory is being used,
because the loaded image must be kept in memory at <br>
all times. In this expression, the trade-off is likely worth
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But back to effects: Other
effects than scaling are also readily available, for
example, you can tile the image to fill the whole window,
instead of resizing it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tile keep { load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, images returned by
&quot;load&quot; are in &quot;tile&quot; mode by default, so
the &quot;tile&quot; operator is kind of superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another common effect is to
mirror the image, so that the same edges touch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirror keep { load
&quot;$HOME/mypic.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another common background
expression is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This one first takes a snapshot
of the screen background image, and then moves it to the
upper left corner of the screen (as opposed to the upper
left corner of the terminal <br>
window)- the result is pseudo-transparency: the image seems
to be static while the window is moved around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOUR SPECIFICATIONS <br>
Whenever an operator expects a &quot;colour&quot;, then this
can be specified in one of two ways: Either as string with
an X11 colour specification, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;red&quot; # named colour
<br>
&quot;#f00&quot; # simple rgb <br>
&quot;[50]red&quot; # red with 50% alpha <br>
&quot;TekHVC:300/50/50&quot; # anything goes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OR as an array reference with
one, three or four components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[0.5] # 50% gray, 100% alpha
<br>
[0.5, 0, 0] # dark red, no green or blur, 100% alpha <br>
[0.5, 0, 0, 0.7] # same with explicit 70% alpha</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CACHING AND SENSITIVITY <br>
Since some operations (such as &quot;load&quot; and
&quot;blur&quot;) can take a long time, caching results can
be very important for a smooth operation. Caching can also
be useful to reduce memory <br>
usage, though, for example, when an image is cached by
&quot;load&quot;, it could be shared by multiple terminal
windows running inside urxvtd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;keep { ... }&quot;
caching</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most important way to cache
expensive operations is to use &quot;keep { ... }&quot;. The
&quot;keep&quot; operator takes a block of multiple
statements enclosed by &quot;{}&quot; and keeps the return
<br>
value in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An expression can be
&quot;sensitive&quot; to various external events, such as
scaling or moving the window, root background changes and
timers. Simply using an expression (such as
&quot;scale&quot; <br>
without parameters) that depends on certain changing values
(called &quot;variables&quot;), or using those variables
directly, will make an expression sensitive to these events
- for <br>
example, using &quot;scale&quot; or &quot;TW&quot; will make
the expression sensitive to the terminal size, and thus to
resizing events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When such an event happens,
&quot;keep&quot; will automatically trigger a reevaluation
of the whole expression with the new value of the
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;keep&quot; is most useful
for expensive operations, such as &quot;blur&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign keep { blur 20, root
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes a blurred copy of the
root background once, and on subsequent calls, just
root-aligns it. Since &quot;blur&quot; is usually quite slow
and &quot;rootalign&quot; is quite fast, this trades <br>
extra memory (for the cached blurred pixmap) with speed
(blur only needs to be redone when root changes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;load&quot; caching</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;load&quot; operator
itself does not keep images in memory, but as long as the
image is still in memory, &quot;load&quot; will use the
in-memory image instead of loading it freshly from <br>
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That means that this
expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep { load
&quot;$HOME/path...&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not only caches the image in
memory, other terminal instances that try to
&quot;load&quot; it can reuse that in-memory copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCE <br>
COMMAND LINE SWITCHES <br>
--background-expr perl-expression <br>
Specifies the Perl expression to evaluate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--background-border <br>
By default, the expression creates an image that fills the
full window, overwriting borders and any other areas, such
as the scrollbar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying this flag changes the
behaviour, so that the image only replaces the background of
the character area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--background-interval seconds
<br>
Since some operations in the underlying XRender extension
can effectively freeze your X-server for prolonged time,
this extension enforces a minimum time between updates, <br>
which is normally about 0.1 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to do updates more
often, you can decrease this safety interval with this
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROVIDERS/GENERATORS <br>
These functions provide an image, by loading it from disk,
grabbing it from the root screen or by simply generating it.
They are used as starting points to get an image you can
<br>
play with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load $path <br>
Loads the image at the given $path. The image is set to
plane tiling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the image is already in
memory (e.g. because another terminal instance uses it),
then the in-memory copy is returned instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load_uc $path <br>
Load uncached - same as load, but does not cache the image,
which means it is always loaded from the filesystem again,
even if another copy of it is in memory at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root <br>
Returns the root window pixmap, that is, hopefully, the
background image of your screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function makes your
expression root sensitive, that means it will be reevaluated
when the bg image changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">solid $colour <br>
solid $width, $height, $colour <br>
Creates a new image and completely fills it with the given
colour. The image is set to tiling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $width and $height are
omitted, it creates a 1x1 image, which is useful for solid
backgrounds or for use in filtering effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clone $img <br>
Returns an exact copy of the image. This is useful if you
want to have multiple copies of the same image to apply
different effects to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge $img ... <br>
Takes any number of images and merges them together,
creating a single image containing them all. The tiling mode
of the first image is used as the tiling mode of the <br>
resulting image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function is called
automatically when an expression returns multiple
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TILING MODES <br>
The following operators modify the tiling mode of an image,
that is, the way that pixels outside the image area are
painted when the image is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tile $img <br>
Tiles the whole plane with the image and returns this new
image - or in other words, it returns a copy of the image in
plane tiling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load an image and tile
it over the background, without resizing. The
&quot;tile&quot; call is superfluous because
&quot;load&quot; already defaults to tiling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tile load
&quot;mybg.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirror $img <br>
Similar to tile, but reflects the image each time it uses a
new copy, so that top edges always touch top edges, right
edges always touch right edges and so on (with normal <br>
tiling, left edges always touch right edges and top always
touch bottom edges).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load an image and
mirror it over the background, avoiding sharp edges at the
image borders at the expense of mirroring the image
itself</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirror load
&quot;mybg.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad $img <br>
Takes an image and modifies it so that all pixels outside
the image area become transparent. This mode is most useful
when you want to place an image over another image or <br>
the background colour while leaving all background pixels
outside the image unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load an image and
display it in the upper left corner. The rest of the space
is left &quot;empty&quot; (transparent or whatever your
compositor does in alpha mode, else <br>
background colour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pad load
&quot;mybg.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extend $img <br>
Extends the image over the whole plane, using the closest
pixel in the area outside the image. This mode is mostly
useful when you use more complex filtering operations and
<br>
want the pixels outside the image to have the same values as
the pixels near the edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: just for curiosity, how
does this pixel extension stuff work?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extend move 50, 50, load
&quot;mybg.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLE VALUES <br>
The following functions provide variable data such as the
terminal window dimensions. They are not (Perl-) variables,
they just return stuff that varies. Most of them make your
<br>
expression sensitive to some events, for example using
&quot;TW&quot; (terminal width) means your expression is
evaluated again when the terminal is resized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TX <br>
TY Return the X and Y coordinates of the terminal window
(the terminal window is the full window by default, and the
character area only when in border-respect mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using these functions makes your
expression sensitive to window moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These functions are mainly
useful to align images to the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load an image and align
it so it looks as if anchored to the background
(that&rsquo;s exactly what &quot;rootalign&quot; does
btw.):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move -TX, -TY, keep { load
&quot;mybg.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TW <br>
TH Return the width (&quot;TW&quot;) and height
(&quot;TH&quot;) of the terminal window (the terminal window
is the full window by default, and the character area only
when in border-respect mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using these functions makes your
expression sensitive to window resizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These functions are mainly
useful to scale images, or to clip images to the window size
to conserve memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: take the screen
background, clip it to the window size, blur it a bit, align
it to the window position and use it as background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clip move -TX, -TY, keep { blur
5, root }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOCUS <br>
Returns a boolean indicating whether the terminal window has
keyboard focus, in which case it returns true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this function makes your
expression sensitive to focus changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common use case is to fade the
background image when the terminal loses focus, often
together with the &quot;-fade&quot; command line option. In
fact, there is a special function for <br>
just that use case: &quot;focus_fade&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: use two entirely
different background images, depending on whether the window
has focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOCUS ? keep { load
&quot;has_focus.jpg&quot; } : keep { load
&quot;no_focus.jpg&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">now Returns the current time as
(fractional) seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this expression does not
make your expression sensitive to time, but the next two
functions do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">again $seconds <br>
When this function is used the expression will be
reevaluated again in $seconds seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load some image and
rotate it according to the time of day (as if it were the
hour pointer of a clock). Update this image every
minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">again 60; <br>
rotate 50, 50, (now % 86400) * -72 / 8640, scale keep { load
&quot;myclock.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">counter $seconds <br>
Like &quot;again&quot;, but also returns an increasing
counter value, starting at 0, which might be useful for some
simple animation effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHAPE CHANGING OPERATORS <br>
The following operators modify the shape, size or position
of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clip $img <br>
clip $width, $height, $img <br>
clip $x, $y, $width, $height, $img <br>
Clips an image to the given rectangle. If the rectangle is
outside the image area (e.g. when $x or $y are negative) or
the rectangle is larger than the image, then the tiling <br>
mode defines how the extra pixels will be filled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $x and $y are missing, then 0
is assumed for both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $width and $height are
missing, then the window size will be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load an image, blur it,
and clip it to the window size to save memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clip keep { blur 10, load
&quot;mybg.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale $img <br>
scale $size_factor, $img <br>
scale $width_factor, $height_factor, $img <br>
Scales the image by the given factors in horizontal ($width)
and vertical ($height) direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one factor is given, it
is used for both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no factors are given, scales
the image to the window size without keeping aspect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize $width, $height, $img
<br>
Resizes the image to exactly $width times $height
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fit $img <br>
fit $width, $height, $img <br>
Fits the image into the given $width and $height without
changing aspect, or the terminal size. That means it will be
shrunk or grown until the whole image fits into the <br>
given area, possibly leaving borders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cover $img <br>
cover $width, $height, $img <br>
Similar to &quot;fit&quot;, but shrinks or grows until all
of the area is covered by the image, so instead of
potentially leaving borders, it will cut off image data that
doesn&rsquo;t fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move $dx, $dy, $img <br>
Moves the image by $dx pixels in the horizontal, and $dy
pixels in the vertical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: move the image right by
20 pixels and down by 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move 20, 30, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align $xalign, $yalign, $img
<br>
Aligns the image according to a factor - 0 means the image
is moved to the left or top edge (for $xalign or $yalign),
0.5 means it is exactly centered and 1 means it touches <br>
the right or bottom edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: remove any visible
border around an image, center it vertically but move it to
the right hand side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align 1, 0.5, pad $img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">center $img <br>
center $width, $height, $img <br>
Centers the image, i.e. the center of the image is moved to
the center of the terminal window (or the box specified by
$width and $height if given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load an image and
center it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">center keep { pad load
&quot;mybg.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign $img <br>
Moves the image so that it appears glued to the screen as
opposed to the window. This gives the illusion of a larger
area behind the window. It is exactly equivalent to
&quot;move <br>
-TX, -TY&quot;, that is, it moves the image to the top left
of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: load a background
image, put it in mirror mode and root align it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign keep { mirror load
&quot;mybg.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: take the screen
background and align it, giving the illusion of transparency
as long as the window isn&rsquo;t in front of other
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate $center_x, $center_y,
$degrees, $img <br>
Rotates the image clockwise by $degrees degrees, around the
point at $center_x and $center_y (specified as factor of
image width/height).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: rotate the image by 90
degrees around its center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate 0.5, 0.5, 90, keep { load
&quot;$HOME/mybg.png&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOUR MODIFICATIONS <br>
The following operators change the pixels of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tint $color, $img <br>
Tints the image in the given colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: tint the image red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tint &quot;red&quot;, load
&quot;rgb.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: the same, but specify
the colour by component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tint [1, 0, 0], load
&quot;rgb.png&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shade $factor, $img <br>
Shade the image by the given factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">contrast $factor, $img <br>
contrast $r, $g, $b, $img <br>
contrast $r, $g, $b, $a, $img <br>
Adjusts the contrast of an image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form applies a single
$factor to red, green and blue, the second form applies
separate factors to each colour channel, and the last form
includes the alpha channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values from 0 to 1 lower the
contrast, values higher than 1 increase the contrast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to limitations in the
underlying XRender extension, lowering contrast also reduces
brightness, while increasing contrast currently also
increases brightness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brightness $bias, $img <br>
brightness $r, $g, $b, $img <br>
brightness $r, $g, $b, $a, $img <br>
Adjusts the brightness of an image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form applies a single
$bias to red, green and blue, the second form applies
separate biases to each colour channel, and the last form
includes the alpha channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values less than 0 reduce
brightness, while values larger than 0 increase it. Useful
range is from -1 to 1 - the former results in a black, the
latter in a white picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to idiosyncrasies in the
underlying XRender extension, biases less than zero can be
very slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also try the
experimental(!) &quot;muladd&quot; operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">muladd $mul, $add, $img #
EXPERIMENTAL <br>
First multiplies the pixels by $mul, then adds $add. This
can be used to implement brightness and contrast at the same
time, with a wider value range than contrast and <br>
brightness operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to numerous bugs in XRender
implementations, it can also introduce a number of visual
artifacts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: increase contrast by a
factor of $c without changing image brightness too much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">muladd $c, (1 - $c) * 0.5,
$img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blur $radius, $img <br>
blur $radius_horz, $radius_vert, $img <br>
Gaussian-blurs the image with (roughly) $radius pixel
radius. The radii can also be specified separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blurring is often very slow, at
least compared or other operators. Larger blur radii are
slower than smaller ones, too, so if you don&rsquo;t want to
freeze your screen for long <br>
times, start experimenting with low values for radius
(&lt;5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focus_fade $img <br>
focus_fade $factor, $img <br>
focus_fade $factor, $color, $img <br>
Fades the image by the given factor (and colour) when focus
is lost (the same as the
&quot;-fade&quot;/&quot;-fadecolor&quot; command line
options, which also supply the default values for <br>
&quot;factor&quot; and $color. Unlike with
&quot;-fade&quot;, the $factor is a real value, not a
percentage value (that is, 0..1, not 0..100).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: do the right thing when
focus fading is requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focus_fade load
&quot;mybg.jpg&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER STUFF <br>
Anything that didn&rsquo;t fit any of the other categories,
even after applying force and closing our eyes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep { ... } <br>
This operator takes a code block as argument, that is, one
or more statements enclosed by braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trick is that this code
block is only evaluated when the outcome changes - on other
calls the &quot;keep&quot; simply returns the image it
computed previously (yes, it should only <br>
be used with images). Or in other words, &quot;keep&quot;
caches the result of the code block so it doesn&rsquo;t need
to be computed again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be extremely useful to
avoid redoing slow operations - for example, if your
background expression takes the root background, blurs it
and then root-aligns it it <br>
would have to blur the root background on every window move
or resize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example is
&quot;load&quot;, which can be quite slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, urxvt itself encloses
the whole expression in some kind of &quot;keep&quot; block
so it only is reevaluated as required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Putting the blur into a
&quot;keep&quot; block will make sure the blur is only done
once, while the &quot;rootalign&quot; is still done each
time the window moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootalign keep { blur 10, root
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This leaves the question of how
to force reevaluation of the block, in case the root
background changes: If expression inside the block is
sensitive to some event (root <br>
background changes, window geometry changes), then it will
be reevaluated automatically as needed.</p>
