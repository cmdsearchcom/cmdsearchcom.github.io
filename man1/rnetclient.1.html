<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rnetclient - Submit the Brazilian Income Tax Report to the
Brazilian Tax Authority</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rnetclient [-d|--declaration] &lt;FILE&gt; [-o
&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;|--output-dir=&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rnetclient is used to send Brazilian tax income reports to
Receita Federal, Braziliam Tax Authority. It communicates
with the official server from Receita Federal, ensures a
<br>
secure connection is established, and submits the file. It
is the product of reverse-engineering ReceitaNet, which is
the proprietary, non-free version of the software that does
<br>
the same thing as rnetclient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d &lt;FILE&gt;, --declaration=&lt;FILE&gt; <br>
Provide the declaration (report) filename to be sent to
Receita Federal. This argument is mandatory. For historical
reasons, the user can also provide the declaration <br>
filename without specifying the -d modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;DIRECTORY&gt;,
--output-dir=&lt;DIRECTORY&gt; <br>
Specify the output directory where the receipt will be
saved. This argument is optional; if no output directory is
specified, then the receipt will be saved in the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent working directory (CWD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY AND MOTIVATION <br>
There is no way to talk about rnetclient without mentioning
IRPF-Livre, which is an older project started and maintained
by Alexandre Oliva. This project exists because Receita <br>
Federal, the Brazilian Tax Authority, does not release the
source code for the software used to fill the Brazilian Tax
Income Report. Alexandre still fights to make Receita
Fed&acirc; <br>
eral release this program as Free Software, but he also
decided to produce and release a Free version of the
program. However, there was still another closed source
software <br>
needed to fully be able to do your duties with the Brazilian
government: the program used to submit the report to Receita
Federal. That is how rnetclient was born.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program began as a personal
project from Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo. He had to
reverse engineer the proprietary software in order to
replicate the functionality, and made <br>
the first release on 2013. In 2014, Alexandre Oliva and
Sergio Durigan Junior joined efforts and helped in the
release of the second version.</p>
