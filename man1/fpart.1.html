<p>FPART(1) BSD General Commands Manual FPART(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fpart &acirc; Sort and pack files into partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fpart [-h] [-V] -n num | -f files | -s size [-i infile] [-a]
[-o outfile] [-e] [-v] [-l] [-b] [-y pattern] [-Y pattern]
[-x pattern] [-X pattern] [-z] [-Z] [-d depth] [-D] [-L]
<br>
[-w cmd] [-W cmd] [-p num] [-q num] [-r num] [FILE or
DIR...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fpart utility helps you sort file trees and pack them
into bags (called &quot;partitions&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-h Print help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARTITION CONTROL <br>
-n num Create exactly num partitions and try to generate
partitions with the same size and number of files. This
option cannot be used in conjunction with -f, -s or -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f files <br>
Create partitions containing at most files files. This
option can be used in conjunction with -s and -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
Create partitions with a maximum size of size bytes. With
this option, partition 0 may be used to handle files that do
not fit in a regular partition, given the provided <br>
size limit. This option can be used in conjunction with -f
and -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT CONTROL <br>
-i infile <br>
Read file list from infile. If infile is &acirc;-&acirc;,
then list is read from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Input contains arbitrary
values; just sort them (do not crawl filesystem). Input must
follow the &acirc;size(blank)path&acirc; scheme. This option
is incompatible with crawling- <br>
related options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT CONTROL <br>
-o outfile <br>
Output partitions&rsquo; contents to outfile template.
Multiple files will be generated given that template. Each
outfile will get partition number as a suffix. If outfile is
<br>
&acirc;-&acirc;, then partitions will be printed to stdout,
with partition number used as a prefix (so you can grep
partitions you are interested in, or do whatever you
want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e When adding directories (see
DIRECTORY HANDLING ), add an ending &acirc;/&acirc; to each
directory entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode (may be
specified more than once).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESYSTEM CRAWLING CONTROL <br>
-l Follow symbolic links (default: do not follow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Do not cross filesystem
boundaries (default: cross).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y pattern <br>
Include files or directories matching pattern only (and
discard all other files). This option may be specified
several times. It does not apply when computing size of <br>
directories to be added as leaf entries (the computed size
will then include every file within directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y pattern <br>
Same as -y but case insensitive. This option may not be
available on your platform (at least FreeBSD and GNU/Linux
support it, Solaris does not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x pattern <br>
Exclude files or directories matching pattern. This option
can be used in conjunction with -y and -Y. In this case,
exclusion is performed after. This option may be spec&acirc;
<br>
ified several times. It does not apply when computing size
of directories to be added as leaf entries (the computed
size will then include every file within directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X pattern <br>
Same as -x but case insensitive. This option may not be
available on your platform (at least FreeBSD and GNU/Linux
support it, Solaris does not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORY HANDLING <br>
-z Pack empty directories. By default, fpart will pack files
only (except when using the -d or -D options). This option
can be useful for tools such as rsync(1) to be able to <br>
recreate a full file tree when used with fpart (e.g. using
rsync&rsquo;s --files-from option). See the -Z option to
also pack un-readable directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Implies -z. Treat un-readable
directories as empty, causing them to be packed anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d depth <br>
After a certain depth, pack directories instead of files
(directories themselves will be added to partitions, instead
of their content).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Implies -z. Pack leaf
directories: if a directory contains files only, it will be
packed as a single entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIVE MODE <br>
-L Live mode (default: disabled). When using this mode,
partitions will be generated while crawling filesystem. This
option saves time and memory, but does not give partition
<br>
0 a special meaning (see option -s ). As a consequence, it
can generate partitions larger than the size specified with
option -s. This option can be used in conjunction <br>
with options -f and -s, but not with option -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w cmd When using live mode,
execute cmd when starting a new partition (before having
opened next output file, if any). cmd is run in a specific
environment that provides several <br>
variables describing the state of the program:
FPART_HOOKTYPE (&quot;pre-part&quot; or
&quot;post-part&quot;), FPART_PARTFILENAME (current
partition&rsquo;s output file name), FPART_PARTNUMBER
(cur&acirc; <br>
rent partition number), FPART_PARTSIZE (current partition
size), FPART_PARTNUMFILES (number of files in current
partition), FPART_PID (PID of fpart). Note that variables
<br>
may or may not be defined, depending of requested options
and current partition&rsquo;s state when the hook is
triggered. Also, note that hooks are executed in a
synchronous way <br>
while crawling filesystem, so 1) avoid executing commands
that take a long time to return as it slows down filesystem
crawling and 2) do not presume cwd (PWD) is the one <br>
fpart has been started in, as it is regularly changed to
speed up crawling (use abolute paths within hooks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W cmd Same as -w, but executes
cmd when finishing a partition (after having closed last
output file, if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIZE HANDLING <br>
-p num Preload each partition with num bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q num Overload each file size
with num bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r num Round each file size up
to next num bytes multiple. This option can be used in
conjunction with overloading, which is done *before*
rounding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpart -n 3 -o var-parts /var
<br>
Produce 3 partitions, with (hopefully) the same size and
number of files. Three files: var-parts.0, var-parts.1 and
var-parts.2 are generated as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpart -s 4724464025 -o
music-parts /path/to/music ./*.mp3 <br>
Produce partitions of 4.4 GB, containing music files from
/path/to/music as well as MP3 files from current directory;
with such a partition size, each partition content <br>
will be ready to be burnt to a DVD. Files music-parts.0 to
music-parts.n, are generated as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find /usr ! -type d | fpart -f
10000 -i - /home | grep &rsquo;^0:&rsquo; <br>
Produce partitions containing 10000 files each by examining
/usr first and then /home and display only partition 0 on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">du * | fpart -n 2 -a <br>
Produce two partitions by using du(1) output. Fpart will not
examine the file system but instead use arbitrary values
printed by du(1) and sort them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
du(1), find(1), fpsync(1), grep(1), rsync(1)</p>
