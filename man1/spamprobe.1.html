<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
spamprobe - a bayesian spam filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
spamprobe [options] &lt;command&gt; [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
SpamProbe can be used in conjunction with procmail or
similar program to filter email. SpamProbe uses a
statistical algorithm to identify the key words and phrases
in email and <br>
determine which emails are legitimate and which are spam.
The algorithm used by SpamProbe is based on an excellent
article by Paul Graham. He describes the basic idea and his
<br>
results. You can read his article here:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE USAGE <br>
SpamProbe accepts a small set of commands and a growing set
of options on the command line in addition to zero or more
file names of mboxes. The general usage is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe [options]
&lt;command&gt; [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recognized options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a char</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default SpamProbe converts
non-ascii characters (characters <br>
with the most significant bit set to 1) into the letter
&rsquo;z&rsquo;. This <br>
is useful for lumping all Asian characters into a single
word for <br>
easy recognition. The -a option allows you to change the
<br>
character to something else if you don&rsquo;t like the
letter &rsquo;z&rsquo; for <br>
some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells spamprobe to create the
database directory if it does not <br>
already exist. Normally spamprobe exits with a usage error
if <br>
the database directory does not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe to assign a
default, somewhat neutral, probability <br>
to any term that does not have a weighted (good count
doubled) <br>
count of at least number in the database. This prevents
terms <br>
which have been seen only a few times from having an
unreasonable <br>
influence on the score of an email containing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 5. For
example if number is 5 then in order <br>
for a term to use its calculated probability it must have
been <br>
seen 3 times in good mails, or 2 times in good mails and
once in <br>
spam, or 5 times in spam, or some other combination adding
up to <br>
at least 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default SpamProbe stores its
database in a directory named <br>
.spamprobe under your home directory. The -d option allows
you to <br>
specify a different directory to use. This is necessary if
your <br>
home directory is NFS mounted for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory name can be
prefixed with a special code to force <br>
SpamProbe to use a particular type of data file format. The
type <br>
codes depend on how your copy of SpamProbe was compiled.
Defined <br>
types include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example Description <br>
-d pbl:path Forces the use of PBL data file. <br>
-d hash:path Forces the use of an mmapped hash file. <br>
-d split:path Forces the use of a hash file and ISAM <br>
file (may provide better precision than <br>
plain hash in some cases).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hash: option can also
specify a desired file size in megabytes <br>
before the path. For example -d hash:19:path would cause
<br>
SpamProbe to use a 19 MB hash file. The size must be in the
range <br>
of 1-100. The default hash file size is 16 MB. Because hash
<br>
files have a fixed size and capacity they should be cleaned
<br>
relatively often using the cleanup command (see below) to
prevent <br>
them from becoming full or being slowed by too many hash key
<br>
collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash files provide better
performance than either of the ISAM <br>
options (PBL or Berkeley DB). However hash files do not
store the <br>
original terms. Only a 32 bit hash key is stored with each
term. <br>
This prevents a user from exploring the terms in the
database <br>
using the dump command to see what words are particularly
spammy <br>
or hammy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe to use the
database in the specified directory <br>
(must be different than the one specified with the -d
option) as a <br>
shared database from which to draw terms that are not
defined in <br>
the user&rsquo;s own database. This can be used to provide a
baseline <br>
database shared by all users on a system (in the -D
directory) and <br>
a private database unique to each user of the system <br>
($HOME/.spamprobe or -d directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g field_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe what header to
look for previous score and message <br>
digest in. Default is X-SpamProbe. Field name is not case
<br>
sensitive. Used by all commands except receive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default SpamProbe removes
HTML markup from the text in emails <br>
to help avoid false positives. The -h option allows you to
<br>
override this behavior and force SpamProbe to include words
from <br>
within HTML tags in its word counts. Note that SpamProbe
always <br>
counts any URLs in hrefs within tags whether -h is used or
not. <br>
Use of this option is discouraged. It can increase the rate
of <br>
spam detection slightly but unless the user receives a
significant <br>
amount of HTML emails it also tends to increase the number
of <br>
false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default SpamProbe only scans
a meaningful subset of headers <br>
from the email message when searching for words to score.
The -H <br>
option allows the user to specify additional headers to
scan. <br>
Legal values are &quot;all&quot;, &quot;nox&quot;,
&quot;none&quot;, or &quot;normal&quot;. &quot;all&quot;
scans <br>
all headers, &quot;nox&quot; scans all headers except those
starting with <br>
X-, &quot;none&quot; does not scan headers, and
&quot;normal&quot; scans the normal <br>
set of headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to those values you
can also explicitly add a header <br>
to the list of headers to process by adding the header name
in <br>
lower case preceded by a plus sign. Multiple headers can be
<br>
specified by using multiple -H options. For example, to
include <br>
only the From and Received headers in your train command you
could <br>
run spamprobe as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -Hnone -H+from
-H+received train</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also selectively ignore
headers that would otherwise be <br>
processed by using -H-headername. For example to process all
<br>
headers except for Subject you could run spamprobe as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -Hall -H-subject
train</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To process the normal set of
headers but also add the SpamAssassin <br>
header X-SpamStatus you could run spamprobe as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -H+x-spam-status
train</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the spam probability
threshold for emails from the default <br>
(0.7) to number. The number must be a between 0 and 1.
Generally <br>
the value should be above 0.5 to avoid a high false positive
rate. <br>
Lower numbers tend to produce more false positives while
higher <br>
numbers tend to reduce accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forces SpamProbe to use mbox
format for reading emails in receive <br>
mode. Normally SpamProbe assumes that the input to receive
mode <br>
contains a single message so it doesn&rsquo;t look for
message breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forces SpamProbe to treat the
entire input as a single message. <br>
This ignores From lines and Content-Length headers in the
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o option_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enables special options by name.
Currently the only special <br>
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o graham</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to emulate the
filtering algorithm originally <br>
outlined in A Plan For Spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o honor-status-header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to ignore
messages if they have a Status: <br>
header containing a capital D. Some mail servers use this
<br>
status to indicate a message that has been flagged for <br>
deletion but has not yet been purged from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO NOT use this option with the
receive or train command in <br>
your procmailrc file! Doing so could allow spammers to
bypass <br>
the filter. This option is meant to be used with the <br>
train-spam and train-good commands in scripts that <br>
periodically update the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o honor-xstatus-header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to ignore
messages if they have a X-Status: <br>
header containing a capital D. Some mail servers use this
<br>
status to indicate a message that has been flagged for <br>
deletion but has not yet been purged from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO NOT use this option with the
receive or train command in <br>
your procmailrc file! Doing so could allow spammers to
bypass <br>
the filter. This option is meant to be used with the <br>
train-spam and train-good commands in scripts that <br>
periodically update the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o ignore-body</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to ignore terms
from the message body when <br>
computing a score. This is not normally recommended but
might <br>
be useful in conjunction with some other filter. For
example, <br>
the whitelist option (see below) implicitly ignores the <br>
message body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o orig-score</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to use its
original scoring algorithm that <br>
produces excellent results but tends to generate scores of
<br>
either 0 or 1 for all messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o suspicious-tags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to scan the
contents of &quot;suspicious&quot; tags for <br>
tokens rather than simply throwing them out. Currently only
<br>
font tags are scanned but other tags may be added to this
list <br>
in later versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o tokenized</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to read tokens
one per line rather than <br>
processing the input as mbox format. This allows users to
<br>
completely replace the standard spamprobe tokenizer if they
<br>
wish and instead use some external program as a tokenizer.
<br>
For example in your procmailrc file you could use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCORE=| tokenize.pl |
/bin/spamprobe -o tokenized train</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode SpamProbe considers
a blank line to indicate the <br>
end of one message&rsquo;s tokens and the start of a new
message&rsquo;s <br>
tokens. SpamProbe computes a message digest based on the
<br>
lines of text containing the tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o whitelist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes SpamProbe to use
information from the email&rsquo;s headers <br>
to identify whether or not the email is from a legitimate
<br>
correspondent. The message body is ignored as are any never
<br>
before seen terms and phrases in the headers. This option
can <br>
be used with the score command in a procmailrc file to use a
<br>
bayesian white list in conjunction with some other filter or
<br>
rule external to SpamProbe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o option can be used
multiple times and all requested options <br>
will be applied. Note that some options might conflict with
each <br>
other in which case the last option would take
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the maximum number of
words per phrase. Default value is <br>
two. Increasing the limit improves accuracy somewhat but
<br>
increases database size. Experiments indicate that
increasing <br>
beyond two is not worth the extra cost in space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes spamprobe to perform a
purge of all terms with junk count <br>
less than or equal 2 after every number messages are
processed. <br>
Using this option when classifying a large collection of
spam can <br>
prevent the database from growing overly large at the cost
of more <br>
processing time and possible loss of precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the number of times that
a single word/phrase can occur <br>
in the top words array used to calculate the score for each
<br>
message. Allowing repeats reduces the number of words
overall <br>
(since a single word occupies more than one slot) but allows
words <br>
which occur frequently in the message to have a higher
weight. <br>
Generally this is changed only for optimization
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes spamprobe to treat the
input as a single message and to <br>
base its exit code on whether or not that message was spam.
The <br>
exit code will be 0 if the message was spam or 1 if the
message <br>
was good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamProbe maintains an in memory
cache of the words it has seen in <br>
previous messages to reduce disk I/O and improve
performance. By <br>
default the cache will contain the most recently accessed
2,500 <br>
terms. This number can be changed using the -s option. Using
a <br>
larger the cache size will cause SpamProbe to use more
memory and, <br>
potentially, to perform less database I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A value of zero causes SpamProbe
to use 100,000 as the limit which <br>
effectively means that the cache will only be flushed at
program <br>
exit (unless you have really enormous mailbox files). The
cache <br>
doesn&rsquo;t affect receive, dump, or export but has a
significant <br>
impact on the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T <br>
Causes SpamProbe to write out the top terms associated with
each <br>
message in addition to its normal output. Works with
find-good, <br>
find-spam, and score.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe to write
debugging information to stderr. This <br>
can be useful for debugging or for seeing which terms
SpamProbe <br>
used to score each email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints version and copyright
information and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the number of most
significant words/phrases used by <br>
SpamProbe to calculate the score for each message. Generally
this <br>
is changed only for optimization purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally SpamProbe uses only a
fixed number of top terms (as set <br>
by the -w command line option) when scoring emails. The -x
option <br>
can be used to allow the array to be extended past the max
size if <br>
more terms are available with probabilities &lt;= 0.1 or
&gt;= 0.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An interesting variation on the
scoring settings. Equivalent to <br>
using &quot;-w5 -r5 -x&quot; so that generally only words
with probabilites <br>
&lt;= 0.1 or &gt;= 0.9 are used and word frequencies in the
email count <br>
heavily towards the score. Tests have shown that this
setting <br>
tends to be safer (fewer false positives) and have higher
recall <br>
(proper classification of spams previously scored as spam)
<br>
although its predictive power isn&rsquo;t quite as good as
the default <br>
settings. WARNING: This setting might work best with a
fairly <br>
large corpus, it has not been tested with a small corpus so
it <br>
might be very inaccurate with fewer than 1000 total
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume traditional Berkeley
mailbox format, ignoring any <br>
Content-Length: fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe to ignore any
characters with the most significant <br>
bit set to 1 instead of mapping them to the letter
&rsquo;z&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe to store all
characters even if their most <br>
significant bit is set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamProbe recognizes the
following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe help [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments spamprobe
lists all of the valid commands. <br>
If one or more commands are specified after the word help,
<br>
spamprobe will print a more verbose description of each
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe create-db</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no database currently exists
spamprobe will attempt to create <br>
one and then exit. This can be used to bootstrap a new <br>
installation. Strictly speaking this command is not
necessary <br>
since the train-spam, train-good, and auto-train commands
will also <br>
create a database if none already exists but some users like
to <br>
create a database as a separate installation step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe create-config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writes a new configuration file
named spamprobe.hdl into the <br>
database directory (normally $HOME/.spamprobe). Any existing
<br>
configuration file will be overwritten so be sure to make a
copy <br>
before invoking this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe receive
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells SpamProbe to read its
standard input (or a file specified <br>
after the receive command) and score it using the current
<br>
databases. Once the message has been scored the message is
<br>
classified as either spam or non-spam and its word counts
are <br>
written to the appropriate database. The message&rsquo;s
score is <br>
written to stdout along with a single word. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPAM 0.9999999
595f0150587edd7b395691964069d7af</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GOOD 0.0200000
595f0150587edd7b395691964069d7af</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string of numbers and
letters after the score is the message&rsquo;s <br>
&quot;digest&quot;, a 32 character number which uniquely
identifies the <br>
message. The digest is used by SpamProbe to recognize
messages <br>
that it has processed previously so that it can keep its
word <br>
counts consistent if the message is reclassified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the -T option additionally
lists the terms used to produce <br>
the score along with their counts (number of times they were
found <br>
in the message).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe train
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functionally identical to
receive except that the database is only <br>
modified if the message was &quot;difficult&quot; to
classify. In practice <br>
this can reduce the number of database updates to as little
as 10% <br>
of messages received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe score
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to receive except that
the database is not modified in <br>
any way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe summarize
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to score except that it
prints a short summary and score <br>
for each message. This can be useful when testing. Using the
-T <br>
option additionally lists the terms used to produce the
score along <br>
with their counts (number of times they were found in the
message).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe find-spam
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to score except that it
prints a short summary and score <br>
for each message that is determined to be spam. This can be
useful <br>
when testing. Using the -T option additionally lists the
terms <br>
used to produce the score along with their counts (number of
times <br>
they were found in the message).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe find-good
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to score except that it
prints a short summary and score <br>
for each message that is determined to be good. This can be
useful <br>
when testing. Using the -T option additionally lists the
terms <br>
used to produce the score along with their counts (number of
times <br>
they were found in the message).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe auto-train {SPAM|GOOD
filename...}...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempts to efficiently build a
database from all of the named <br>
files. You may specify one or more file of each type. Prior
to <br>
each set of file names you must include the word SPAM or
GOOD to <br>
indicate what type of mail is contained in the files which
follow <br>
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The case of the SPAM and GOOD
keywords is important. Any number of <br>
file names can be specified between the keywords. The
command line <br>
format is very flexible. You can even use a find command in
<br>
backticks to process whole directory trees of files. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe auto-train SPAM
spams/* GOOD &lsquo;find hams -type f&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamProbe pre-scans the files to
determine how many emails of each <br>
type exist and then trains on hams and spams in a random
sequence <br>
that balances the inflow of each type so that the train
command can <br>
work most effectively. For example if you had 400 hams and
400 <br>
spams, auto-train will generally process one spam, then one
ham, <br>
etc. If you had 4000 spams and 400 hams then auto-train will
<br>
generally process 10 spams, then one ham, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this command will likely
take a long time to run it is often <br>
desireable to use it with the -v option to see progress
information <br>
as the messages are processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -v auto-train SPAM
spams/* GOOD hams/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe good [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scans each file (or stdin if no
file is specified) and reclassifies <br>
every email in the file as non-spam. The databases are
updated <br>
appropriately. Messages previously classified as good
(recognized <br>
using their MD5 digest or message ids) are ignored. Messages
<br>
previously classified as spam are reclassified as good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe train-good
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functionally identical to
&quot;good&quot; command except that it only <br>
updates the database for messages that are either
incorrectly <br>
classified (i.e. classified as spam) or are
&quot;difficult&quot; to <br>
classify. In practice this can reduce amount of database
updates <br>
to as little as 10% of messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe spam [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scans each file (or stdin if no
file is specified) and reclassifies <br>
every email in the file as spam. The databases are updated
<br>
appropriately. Messages previously classified as spam
(recognized <br>
using their MD5 digest of message ids) are ignored. Messages
<br>
previously classified as good are reclassified as spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe train-spam
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functionally identical to
&quot;spam&quot; command except that it only <br>
updates the database for messages that are either
incorrectly <br>
classified (i.e. classified as good) or are
&quot;difficult&quot; to <br>
classify. In practice this can reduce amount of database
updates <br>
to as little as 10% of messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe remove
[filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scans each file (or stdin if no
file is specified) and removes its <br>
term counts from the database. Messages which are not in the
<br>
database (recognized using their MD5 digest of message ids)
are <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe cleanup [ junk_count [
max_age ] ]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scans the database and removes
all terms with junk_count or less <br>
(default 2) which have not had their counts modified in at
least <br>
max_age days (default 7). You can specify multiple count/age
pairs <br>
on a single command line but must specify both a count and
an age <br>
for all but the last count. This should be run periodically
to <br>
keep the database from growing endlessly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For my own email I use cron to
run the cleanup command every day <br>
and delete all terms with count of 2 or less that have not
been <br>
modified in the last two weeks. Here is the excerpt from my
<br>
crontab:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 0 * * *
/home/brian/bin/spamprobe cleanup 2 14</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you might want to
use a much higher count (1000 in <br>
this example) for terms that have not been seen in roughly
six <br>
months:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 0 * * *
/home/brian/bin/spamprobe cleanup 1000 180 2 14</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the way that PBL and
BerkeleyDB work the database file <br>
will not actually shrink, but newly added terms will be able
to use <br>
the space previously occupied by any removed terms so that
the <br>
file&rsquo;s growth should be significantly slower if this
command is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To actually shrink the database
you can build a new one using the <br>
BerkeleyDB utility programs db_dump and db_load (Berkeley DB
only) <br>
or the spamprobe import and export commands (either database
<br>
library). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd ~ <br>
mkdir new.spamprobe <br>
spamprobe export | spamprobe -d new.spamprobe import <br>
mv .spamprobe old.spamprobe <br>
mv new.spamprobe .spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P option can also be used
to limit the rate of growth of the <br>
database when importing a large number of emails. For
example if <br>
you want to classify 1000 emails and want SP to purge rare
terms <br>
every 100 messages use a command such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -P 100 good
goodmailboxname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using -P slows down the
classification but can avoid the need to <br>
use the db_dump trick. Using -P only makes sense when
classifying <br>
a large number of messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe purge [ junk_count
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to cleanup but forces
the immediate deletion of all terms <br>
with total count less than junk_count (default is 2) no
matter how <br>
long it has been since they were modified (i.e. even if they
were <br>
just added today). This could be handy immediately after
<br>
classifying a large mailbox of historical spam or good email
to <br>
make room for the next batch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe purge-terms regex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to purge except that it
removes from the database all terms <br>
which match the specified regular expression. Be careful
with this <br>
command because it could remove many more terms than you
expect. <br>
Use dump with the same regex before running this command to
see <br>
exactly what will be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe edit-term term
good_count spam_count</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can be used to specifically set
the good and spam counts of a term. <br>
Whether this is truly useful is doubtful but it is provided
for <br>
completeness sake. For example it could be used to force a
<br>
particular word to be very spammy or very good:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe edit-term nigeria 0
1000000 <br>
spamprobe edit-term burton 10000000 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe dump [ regex ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints the contents of the word
counts database one word per line <br>
in human readable format with spam probability, good count,
spam <br>
count, flags, and word in columns separated by whitespace.
PBL and <br>
Berkeley DB sort terms alphabetically. The standard unix
sort <br>
command can be used to sort the terms as desired. For
example to <br>
list all words from &quot;most good&quot; to &quot;least
good&quot; use this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe dump | sort -k 1n -k
2nr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list all words from
&quot;most spammy&quot; to &quot;least spammy&quot; use this
<br>
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe dump | sort -k 1nr -k
3nr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally you can specify a
regular expression. If specified <br>
SpamProbe will only dump terms matching the regular
expression. <br>
For example: i <br>
n <br>
spamprobe dump &rsquo;ainance&rsquo; <br>
spamprobe dump &rsquo;n <br>
spamprobe dump &rsquo;HSubject_.*finance&rsquo; <br>
e <br>
spamprobe tokenize [ filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prints the tokens found in the
file one word per line in human <br>
readable format with spam probability, good count, spam
count, <br>
message count, and word in columns separated by whitespace.
Terms <br>
are listed in the order in which they were encountered in
the <br>
message. The standard unix sort command can be used to sort
the <br>
terms as desired. For example to list all words from
&quot;most good&quot; <br>
to &quot;least good&quot; use this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe tokenize filename |
sort -k 1n -k 2nr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list all words from
&quot;most spammy&quot; to &quot;least spammy&quot; use this
<br>
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe tokenize filename |
sort -k 1nr -k 3nr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe export</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to the dump command but
prints the counts and words in a <br>
comma separated format with the words surrounded by double
quotes. <br>
This can be more useful for importing into some
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe import</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reads the specified files which
must contain export data written by <br>
the export command. The terms and counts from this file are
added <br>
to the database. This can be used to convert a database from
a <br>
prior version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe exec command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obtains an exclusive lock on the
database and then executes the <br>
command using system(3). If multiple arguments are given
after <br>
&quot;exec&quot; they are combined to form the command to be
executed. This <br>
command can be used when you want to perform some operation
on the <br>
database without interference from incoming mail. For
example, to <br>
back up your .spamprobe directory using tar you could do
something <br>
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd <br>
spamprobe exec tar cf spamprobe-data.tar.gz .spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you simply want to hold the
lock while interactively running <br>
commands in a different xterm you could use &quot;spamprobe
exec read&quot;. <br>
The linux read program simply reads a line of text from your
<br>
terminal so the lock would effectively be held until you
pressed <br>
the enter key. Another option would be to use a shell as the
<br>
command and type the commands into that shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe /bin/bash <br>
ls <br>
date <br>
exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful not to run spamprobe
in the shell though since the <br>
spamprobe in the shell will wind up deadlocked waiting for
the <br>
spamprobe running the exec command to release its lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe exec-shared
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as exec except that a
shared lock is used. This may be more <br>
appropriate if you are backing up your database since
operations <br>
like score (but not train or receive) could still be
performed on <br>
the database while the backup was running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP OF SPAMPROBE FOR USERS
<br>
Once you have a spamprobe executable copy it to someplace in
your PATH so that procmail can find it. Then create a
directory for SpamProbe to store its databases in. By
default <br>
SpamProbe wants to use the directory ~/.spamprobe. You must
create this directory manually in order to run SpamProbe or
else specify some other directory using the -d option. <br>
Something like this should suffice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir ~/.spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamProbe can use either the PBL
or Berkeley DB library for its databases. Both are fast on
local file systems but very slow over NFS. Please ensure
that your spamprobe direc&acirc; <br>
tory is on a local file system to ensure good
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES USING HASH DATABASE <br>
SpamProbe can use a simple, fixed size hash data file as an
alternative to PBL or BDB. There are two advantages to the
hash format. The first is speed. In my experiments the <br>
hash file format is around 2x the speed of PBL (ranged from
1.8x to 3.5x). The second advantage is that the hash data
file size is fixed. You choose a size when you create the
<br>
file and it never changes. File size can be anywhere from
1-100 MB. You need to choose a size large enough to hold
your terms with room to spare. More on that later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hash file format also has
significant disadvantages. Becuase the file size is fixed
you must monitor the file to ensure that it does not become
overly full. When the file <br>
becomes more than half full performance will suffer. Also
the hash format does not store original terms so you cannot
use the dump command to learn what terms are spammy or <br>
hammy in your database. Finally, the hash format is
imprecise. Hash collisions can cause the counts from
different terms to be mixed together which can reduce
accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a hash data file you
add a prefix to the directory name in the -d command line
option. You can specify just the directory like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -d
hash:$HOME/.spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or you can add a size in
megabytes for the file like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe -d
hash:42:$HOME/.spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size is only used when a
file is first created. SP auto detects the size of an
existing hash file. You need to allow enough space for twice
as many terms as you are likely <br>
to have in your file. In my database I have 2.2 million
terms. That required a database of are 53 MB. SP uses 12
bytes per term in the hash file so you can estimate the file
<br>
size you&rsquo;ll need by multiplying the number of terms by
24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hash format does not store
the original terms. Instead it stores the 32 bit hash code
for each term. You can do just about anything with a hash
file that you could with a <br>
PBL file including import/export, edit-term, cleanup, purge,
etc. You can use export your PBL database and import it to
build a hash file (note that you cannot go the other <br>
direction) and you can export one hash file and import into
a new one to enlarge your file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR FORMAT <br>
SpamProbe will accept a maildir directory name anywhere that
an Mbox or MBX file name can be specified. When SpamProbe
encounters a Maildir mailbox (directory) name it will <br>
automatically process all of the non-hidden files in the cur
and new subdirectories of the mailbox. There is no need to
individually specify these subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
SpamProbe is not a stand alone mail filter. It doesn&rsquo;t
sort your mail or split it into different mailboxes. Instead
it relies on some other program such as procmail to actually
<br>
file your mail for you. What SpamProbe does do is track the
word counts in good and spam emails and generate a score for
each email that indicates whether or not it is likely to
<br>
be spam. Scores range from 0 to 1 with any score of 0.9 or
higher indicating a probable spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Personally I use SpamProbe with
procmail to filter my incoming email into mail boxes. I have
procmail score each inbound email using SpamProbe and insert
a special header into <br>
each email containing its score. Then I have procmail move
spams into a special mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No spam filter is perfect and
SpamProbe sometimes makes mistakes. To correct those
mistakes I have a special mailbox that I put undetected
spams into. I run SpamProbe periodi&acirc; <br>
cally and have it reclassify any emails in that mailbox as
spam so that it will make a better guess the next time
around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not a procmail primer.
You will need to ensure that you have procmail and formail
installed before you can use this technique. Also I
recommend that you read the proc&acirc; <br>
mail documentation so that you can fully understand this
example and adapt it to your own needs. That having been
said, my .procmailrc file looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR=$HOME/IMAP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0 c <br>
saved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0 <br>
SCORE=| /home/brian/bin/spamprobe train <br>
:0 wf <br>
| formail -I &quot;X-SpamProbe: $SCORE&quot; <br>
:0 a: <br>
*^X-SpamProbe: SPAM <br>
spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I use IMAP to fetch my email so
my mailboxes all live in a directory named IMAP on my mail
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The first stanza copies
all incoming emails into a special mbox called saved.
SpamProbe IS BETA SOFTWARE and though it works well for me
it is possible that it could some&acirc; <br>
how lose emails. Caution is always a good idea. That having
been said, with the procmailrc file as shown above the worst
that could happen if SpamProbe crashes is that the <br>
email would not be scored properly and procmail would
deliver it to your inbox. Of course if procmail crashes all
bets are off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second stanza runs spamprobe
in &quot;train&quot; mode to score the email, classify it as
either spam or good, and possibly update the database. The
train command tries to minimize <br>
the number of database updates by only updating the database
with terms from an incoming message if there was
insufficient confidence in the message&rsquo;s score. The
train command <br>
always updates the database on the first 1500 of each type
received. This ensures that sufficient email is classified
to allow the filter to operate reliably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next stanza runs formail to
add a custom header to the email containing the SpamProbe
score. The final stanza uses the contents of the custom
header to file detected spams <br>
into a special mbox named spamprobe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an alternative to using the
train command, you can run spamprobe in &quot;receive&quot;
mode. In that mode SpamProbe scores the email and then
classifies it as either spam or good <br>
based on the score. It always automatically adds the word
counts for the email to the appropriate database. This is
essentially like running in score mode followed immediately
<br>
by either spam or good mode. It produces more database I/O
and a bigger database but ensures that every message has its
terms reflected in the database. Personally I use train <br>
mode. A sample procmailrc file using the receive command
looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR=$HOME/IMAP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0 c <br>
saved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0 <br>
SCORE=| /home/brian/bin/spamprobe receive <br>
:0 wf <br>
| formail -I &quot;X-SpamProbe: $SCORE&quot; <br>
:0 a: <br>
*^X-SpamProbe: SPAM <br>
spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKING CORRECTIONS <br>
SpamProbe is not perfect. It is able to detect over 99% of
the spams that I receive but some still slip through. To
correct these missed emails I run SpamProbe periodically and
<br>
have it scan a special mbox. Since I use IMAP to retrieve my
emails I can simply drop undetected spams into this mbox
from my mail client. If you use POP or some other system
<br>
then you will need to find a way get the undetected spams
into a mbox that spamprobe can see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Periodically I run a script that
scans three special mboxes to correct errors in
judgment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAPDIR=$HOME/IMAP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe remove $IMAPDIR/remove
<br>
spamprobe good $IMAPDIR/nonspam <br>
spamprobe spam $IMAPDIR/spam <br>
spamprobe train-spam $IMAPDIR/spamprobe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From this example you can see
that I use three special mboxes to make corrections. I copy
emails that I don&rsquo;t want spamprobe to store into the
remove mbox. This is useful if <br>
you receive email from a friend or colleague that looks like
spam and you don&rsquo;t want it to dilute the effectiveness
of the terms it contains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undetected spams go into the
spam mbox. SpamProbe will reclassify those emails as spam
and correct its database accordingly. Note that doing this
does not guarantee that the <br>
spam will always be scored as spam in the future. Some spams
are too bland to detect perfectly. Fortunately those are
very rare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nonspam mbox is for any
false positives. These are always possible and it is
important to have a way to reclassify them when they do
occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using receive mode
rather than train mode then the above script can be modified
to remove the train-spam line. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAPDIR=$HOME/IMAP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe remove $IMAPDIR/remove
<br>
spamprobe good $IMAPDIR/nonspam <br>
spamprobe spam $IMAPDIR/spam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally you&rsquo;ll need to
build a starting database. Since SpamProbe relies on word
counts from past emails it requires a decent sized database
to be accurate. To build the data&acirc; <br>
base select some of your mboxes containing past emails.
Ideally you should have one mbox of spams and one or more of
non-spams. If you don&rsquo;t have any spams handy then
don&rsquo;t <br>
worry, SpamProbe will gradually become more accurate as you
receive more spams. Expect a fairly high false negative
(i.e. missed spams) rate as you first start using
SpamProbe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To import your starting messages
use commands such as these. The example assumes that you
have non-spams stored in a file named mbox in your home
directory and some spams stored <br>
in a file named nasty-spams. Replace these names with real
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamprobe good ~/mbox <br>
spamprobe spam ~/nasty-spams</p>
