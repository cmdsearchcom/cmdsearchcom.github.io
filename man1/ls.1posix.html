<p>LS(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
LS(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ls &acirc; list directory contents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ls [&acirc;ikqrs] [&acirc;glno] [&acirc;A|&acirc;a]
[&acirc;C|&acirc;m|&acirc;x|&acirc;1] [&acirc;F|&acirc;p]
[&acirc;H|&acirc;L] [&acirc;R|&acirc;d]
[&acirc;S|&acirc;f|&acirc;t] [&acirc;c|&acirc;u]
[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For each operand that names a file of a type other than
directory or symbolic link to a directory, ls shall write
the name of the file as well as any requested, associated
infor&acirc; <br>
mation. For each operand that names a file of type
directory, ls shall write the names of files contained
within the directory as well as any requested, associated
information. <br>
Filenames beginning with a &lt;period&gt; (&rsquo;.&rsquo;)
and any associated information shall not be written out
unless explicitly referenced, the &acirc;A or &acirc;a
option is supplied, or an implemen&acirc; <br>
tation-defined condition causes them to be written. If one
or more of the &acirc;d, &acirc;F, or &acirc;l options are
specified, and neither the &acirc;H nor the &acirc;L option
is specified, for each operand <br>
that names a file of type symbolic link to a directory, ls
shall write the name of the file as well as any requested,
associated information. If none of the &acirc;d, &acirc;F,
or &acirc;l options <br>
are specified, or the &acirc;H or &acirc;L options are
specified, for each operand that names a file of type
symbolic link to a directory, ls shall write the names of
files contained within <br>
the directory as well as any requested, associated
information. In each case where the names of files contained
within a directory are written, if the directory contains
any sym&acirc; <br>
bolic links then ls shall evaluate the file information and
file type to be those of the symbolic link itself, unless
the &acirc;L option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no operands are specified, ls
shall behave as if a single operand of dot (&rsquo;.&rsquo;)
had been specified. If more than one operand is specified,
ls shall write non-directory oper&acirc; <br>
ands first; it shall sort directory and non-directory
operands separately according to the collating sequence in
the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ls utility shall detect
infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited
directory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered.
When it detects an infinite loop, <br>
ls shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and
shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ls utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;A Write out all directory
entries, including those whose names begin with a
&lt;period&gt; (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) but excluding the entries
dot and dot-dot (if they exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;C Write multi-text-column
output with entries sorted down the columns, according to
the collating sequence. The number of text columns and the
column separator characters <br>
are unspecified, but should be adapted to the nature of the
output device. This option disables long format output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;F Do not follow symbolic
links named as operands unless the &acirc;H or &acirc;L
options are specified. Write a &lt;slash&gt;
(&rsquo;/&rsquo;) immediately after each pathname that is a
directory, an <br>
&lt;asterisk&gt; (&rsquo;*&rsquo;) after each that is
executable, a &lt;vertical-line&gt; (&rsquo;|&rsquo;) after
each that is a FIFO, and an at-sign (&rsquo;@&rsquo;) after
each that is a symbolic link. For other <br>
file types, other symbols may be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;H Evaluate the file
information and file type for symbolic links specified on
the command line to be those of the file referenced by the
link, and not the link itself; <br>
however, ls shall write the name of the link itself and not
the file referenced by the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L Evaluate the file
information and file type for all symbolic links (whether
named on the command line or encountered in a file
hierarchy) to be those of the file refer&acirc; <br>
enced by the link, and not the link itself; however, ls
shall write the name of the link itself and not the file
referenced by the link. When &acirc;L is used with &acirc;l,
write <br>
the contents of symbolic links in the long format (see the
STDOUT section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;R Recursively list
subdirectories encountered. When a symbolic link to a
directory is encountered, the directory shall not be
recursively listed unless the &acirc;L option is <br>
specified. The use of &acirc;R with &acirc;d or &acirc;f
produces unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;S Sort with the primary
key being file size (in decreasing order) and the secondary
key being filename in the collating sequence (in increasing
order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a Write out all directory
entries, including those whose names begin with a
&lt;period&gt; (&rsquo;.&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Use time of last
modification of the file status information (see the Base
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;) instead of last modification of the file
<br>
itself for sorting (&acirc;t) or writing (&acirc;l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d Do not follow symbolic
links named as operands unless the &acirc;H or &acirc;L
options are specified. Do not treat directories differently
than other types of files. The use of &acirc;d <br>
with &acirc;R or &acirc;f produces unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f List the entries in
directory operands in the order they appear in the
directory. The behavior for non-directory operands is
unspecified. This option shall turn on &acirc;a. <br>
When &acirc;f is specified, any occurrences of the &acirc;r,
&acirc;S, and &acirc;t options shall be ignored and any
occurrences of the &acirc;A, &acirc;g, &acirc;l, &acirc;n,
&acirc;o, and &acirc;s options may be ignored. The <br>
use of &acirc;f with &acirc;R or &acirc;d produces
unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;g Turn on the &acirc;l
(ell) option, but disable writing the file&rsquo;s owner
name or number. Disable the &acirc;C, &acirc;m, and &acirc;x
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i For each file, write
the file&rsquo;s file serial number (see stat() in the
System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k Set the block size for
the &acirc;s option and the per-directory block count
written for the &acirc;l, &acirc;n, &acirc;s, &acirc;g, and
&acirc;o options (see the STDOUT section) to 1024 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;l (The letter ell.) Do
not follow symbolic links named as operands unless the
&acirc;H or &acirc;L options are specified. Write out in
long format (see the STDOUT section). Disable <br>
the &acirc;C, &acirc;m, and &acirc;x options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m Stream output format;
list pathnames across the page, separated by a &lt;comma&gt;
character followed by a &lt;space&gt; character. Use a
&lt;newline&gt; character as the list terminator <br>
and after the separator sequence when there is not room on a
line for the next list entry. This option disables long
format output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n Turn on the &acirc;l
(ell) option, but when writing the file&rsquo;s owner or
group, write the file&rsquo;s numeric UID or GID rather than
the user or group name, respectively. Disable <br>
the &acirc;C, &acirc;m, and &acirc;x options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o Turn on the &acirc;l
(ell) option, but disable writing the file&rsquo;s group
name or number. Disable the &acirc;C, &acirc;m, and &acirc;x
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Write a &lt;slash&gt;
(&rsquo;/&rsquo;) after each filename if that file is a
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;q Force each instance of
non-printable filename characters and &lt;tab&gt; characters
to be written as the &lt;question-mark&gt; (&rsquo;?&rsquo;)
character. Implementations may provide this <br>
option by default if the output is to a terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r Reverse the order of
the sort to get reverse collating sequence oldest first, or
smallest file size first depending on the other options
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Indicate the total
number of file system blocks consumed by each file
displayed. If the &acirc;k option is also specified, the
block size shall be 1024 bytes; otherwise, the <br>
block size is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t Sort with the primary
key being time modified (most recently modified first) and
the secondary key being filename in the collating sequence.
For a symbolic link, the <br>
time used as the sort key is that of the symbolic link
itself, unless ls is evaluating its file information to be
that of the file referenced by the link (see the &acirc;H
<br>
and &acirc;L options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u Use time of last access
(see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;) instead of last modification of the file
for sorting (&acirc;t) or writing (&acirc;l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;x The same as &acirc;C,
except that the multi-text-column output is produced with
entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns. This
option disables long format output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;1 (The numeric digit
one.) Force output to be one entry per line. This option
does not disable long format output. (Long format output is
enabled by &acirc;g, &acirc;l (ell), &acirc;n, <br>
and &acirc;o; and disabled by &acirc;C, &acirc;m, and
&acirc;x.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option that enables long
format output (&acirc;g, &acirc;l (ell), &acirc;n, and
&acirc;o is given with an option that disables long format
output (&acirc;C, &acirc;m, and &acirc;x), this shall not be
considered an <br>
error. The last of these options specified shall determine
whether long format output is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &acirc;R, &acirc;d, or
&acirc;f are specified, the results of specifying these
mutually-exclusive options are specified by the descriptions
of these options above. If more than one of any of <br>
the other options shown in the SYNOPSIS section in
mutually-exclusive sets are given, this shall not be
considered an error; the last option specified in each set
shall determine <br>
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if &acirc;t is
specified, &acirc;c and &acirc;u are not only
mutually-exclusive with each other, they are also
mutually-exclusive with &acirc;S when determining sort
order. But even if &acirc;S is <br>
specified after all occurrences of &acirc;c, &acirc;t, and
&acirc;u, the last use of &acirc;c or &acirc;u determines
the timestamp printed when producing long format output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
written. If the file specified is not found, a diagnostic
message shall be output on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS Determine the
user&rsquo;s preferred column position width for writing
multiple text-column output. If this variable contains a
string representing a decimal integer, the ls <br>
utility shall calculate how many pathname text columns to
write (see &acirc;C) based on the width provided. If COLUMNS
is not set or invalid, an implementation-defined number <br>
of column positions shall be assumed, based on the
implementation&rsquo;s knowledge of the output device. The
column width chosen to write the names of files in any given
<br>
directory shall be constant. Filenames shall not be
truncated to fit into the multiple text-column output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the locale for character collation information in
determining the pathname collation sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments) <br>
and which characters are defined as printable (character
class print).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME Determine the format and
contents for date and time strings written by ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone for
date and time strings written by ls. If TZ is unset or null,
an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The default format shall be to list one entry per line to
standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when one
of the &acirc;C, &acirc;m, or &acirc;x options is specified.
If the output is <br>
to a terminal, the format is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &acirc;m is specified, the
format used for the last element of the list shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format used for each other
element of the list shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s,%s&quot;,
&lt;filename&gt;, &lt;separator&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where, if there is not room for
the next element of the list to fit within the current line
length, &lt;separator&gt; is a string containing an optional
&lt;space&gt; character and a manda&acirc; <br>
tory &lt;newline&gt; character; otherwise it is a single
&lt;space&gt; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;i option is
specified, the file&rsquo;s file serial number (see the Base
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;) shall be written in the following format
before any <br>
other output for the corresponding entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u &quot;, &lt;file serial
number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;l option is
specified, the following information shall be written for
files other than character special and block special
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %u %s %s %u %s %s0,
&lt;file mode&gt;, &lt;number of links&gt;, <br>
&lt;owner name&gt;, &lt;group name&gt;, &lt;size&gt;,
&lt;date and time&gt;, <br>
&lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;l option is
specified, the following information shall be written for
character special and block special files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %u %s %s %s %s %s0,
&lt;file mode&gt;, &lt;number of links&gt;, <br>
&lt;owner name&gt;, &lt;group name&gt;, &lt;device info&gt;,
&lt;date and time&gt;, <br>
&lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases if the file is a
symbolic link and the &acirc;L option is also specified,
this information shall be for the file resolved from the
symbolic link, except that the &lt;path&acirc; <br>
name&gt; field shall contain the pathname of the symbolic
link itself. If the file is a symbolic link and the &acirc;L
option is not specified, this information shall be about the
link <br>
itself and the &lt;pathname&gt; field shall be of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s &acirc;&gt; %s&quot;,
&lt;pathname of link&gt;, &lt;contents of link&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;n, &acirc;g, and
&acirc;o options use the same format as &acirc;l, but with
omitted items and their associated &lt;blank&gt; characters.
See the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both the preceding &acirc;l
forms, if &lt;owner name&gt; or &lt;group name&gt; cannot be
determined, or if &acirc;n is given, they shall be replaced
with their associated numeric values using the <br>
format %u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;size&gt; field shall
contain the value that would be returned for the file in the
st_size field of struct stat (see the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, &lt;sys_stat.h&gt;). <br>
Note that for some file types this value is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;device info&gt; field
shall contain implementation-defined information associated
with the device in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;date and time&gt; field
shall contain the appropriate date and timestamp of when the
file was last modified. In the POSIX locale, the field shall
be the equivalent of the out&acirc; <br>
put of the following date command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%b %e
%H:%M&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the file has been modified in
the last six months, or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%b %e %Y&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where two &lt;space&gt;
characters are used between %e and %Y) if the file has not
been modified in the last six months or if the modification
date is in the future, except that, in <br>
both cases, the final &lt;newline&gt; produced by date shall
not be included and the output shall be as if the date
command were executed at the time of the last modification
date of <br>
the file rather than the current time. When the LC_TIME
locale category is not set to the POSIX locale, a different
format and order of presentation of this field may be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pathname was specified as
a file operand, it shall be written as specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file mode written under the
&acirc;l, &acirc;n, &acirc;g, and &acirc;o options shall
consist of the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%c%s%s%s%s&quot;,
&lt;entry type&gt;, &lt;owner permissions&gt;, <br>
&lt;group permissions&gt;, &lt;other permissions&gt;, <br>
&lt;optional alternate access method flag&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;optional alternate
access method flag&gt; shall be the empty string if there is
no alternate or additional access control method associated
with the file; otherwise, it shall <br>
be a string containing a single printable character that is
not a &lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;entry type&gt; character
shall describe the type of file, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Block special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Character special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l (ell) Symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p FIFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; Regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations may add other
characters to this list to represent other
implementation-defined file types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next three fields shall be
three characters each:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;owner permissions&gt; <br>
Permissions for the file owner class (see the Base
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 4.4, File
Access Permissions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;group permissions&gt; <br>
Permissions for the file group class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;other permissions&gt; <br>
Permissions for the file other class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each field shall have three
character positions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If &rsquo;r&rsquo;, the file
is readable; if &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the file is not
readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If &rsquo;w&rsquo;, the file
is writable; if &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the file is not
writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The first of the following
that applies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S If in &lt;owner
permissions&gt;, the file is not executable and set-user-ID
mode is set. If in &lt;group permissions&gt;, the file is
not executable and set-group-ID mode is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s If in &lt;owner
permissions&gt;, the file is executable and set-user-ID mode
is set. If in &lt;group permissions&gt;, the file is
executable and set-group-ID mode is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T If in &lt;other
permissions&gt; and the file is a directory, search
permission is not granted to others, and the restricted
deletion flag is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t If in &lt;other
permissions&gt; and the file is a directory, search
permission is granted to others, and the restricted deletion
flag is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x The file is executable or the
directory is searchable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc; None of the attributes
of &rsquo;S&rsquo;, &rsquo;s&rsquo;, &rsquo;T&rsquo;,
&rsquo;t&rsquo;, or &rsquo;x&rsquo; applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations may add other
characters to this list for the third character position.
Such additions shall, however, be written in lowercase if
the file is executable or <br>
searchable, and in uppercase if it is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the &acirc;l,
&acirc;n, &acirc;s, &acirc;g, or &acirc;o options is
specified, each list of files within the directory shall be
preceded by a status line indicating the number of file
system blocks <br>
occupied by files in the directory in 512-byte units if the
&acirc;k option is not specified, or 1024-byte units if the
&acirc;k option is specified, rounded up to the next
integral number <br>
of units, if necessary. In the POSIX locale, the format
shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;total %u0, &lt;number of
units in the directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one directory, or a
combination of non-directory files and directories are
written, either as a result of specifying multiple operands,
or the &acirc;R option, each list <br>
of files within a directory shall be preceded by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1s:0, &lt;directory
name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this string is the first
thing to be written, the first &lt;newline&gt; shall not be
written. This output shall precede the number of units in
the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;s option is given,
each file shall be written with the number of blocks used by
the file. Along with &acirc;C, &acirc;1, &acirc;m, or
&acirc;x, the number and a &lt;space&gt; shall precede the
file&acirc; <br>
name; with &acirc;l, &acirc;n, &acirc;g, or &acirc;o, they
shall precede each line describing a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Many implementations use the &lt;equals-sign&gt;
(&rsquo;=&rsquo;) to denote sockets bound to the file system
for the &acirc;F option. Similarly, many historical
implementations use the &rsquo;s&rsquo; character to <br>
denote sockets as the entry type characters for the &acirc;l
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is difficult for an
application to use every part of the file modes field of ls
&acirc;l in a portable manner. Certain file types and
executable bits are not guaranteed to be <br>
exactly as shown, as implementations may have extensions.
Applications can use this field to pass directly to a user
printout or prompt, but actions based on its contents should
<br>
generally be deferred, instead, to the test utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of ls (with the
&acirc;l and related options) contains information that
logically could be used by utilities such as chmod and touch
to restore files to a known state. How&acirc; <br>
ever, this information is presented in a format that cannot
be used directly by those utilities or be easily translated
into a format that can be used. A character has been added
<br>
to the end of the permissions string so that applications at
least have an indication that they may be working in an area
they do not understand instead of assuming that they can
<br>
translate the permissions string into something that can be
used. Future versions or related documents may define one or
more specific characters to be used based on different <br>
standard additional or alternative access control
mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with many of the utilities
that deal with filenames, the output of ls for multiple
files or in one of the long listing formats must be used
carefully on systems where file&acirc; <br>
names can contain embedded white space. Systems and system
administrators should institute policies and user training
to limit the use of such filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of disk blocks
occupied by the file that it reports varies depending on
underlying file system type, block size units reported, and
the method of calculating the num&acirc; <br>
ber of blocks. On some file system types, the number is the
actual number of blocks occupied by the file (counting
indirect blocks and ignoring holes in the file); on others
it <br>
is calculated based on the file size (usually making an
allowance for indirect blocks, but ignoring holes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
An example of a small directory tree being fully listed with
ls &acirc;laRF a in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total 11 <br>
drwxr-xr-x 3 fox prog 64 Jul 4 12:07 ./ <br>
drwxrwxrwx 4 fox prog 3264 Jul 4 12:09 ../ <br>
drwxr-xr-x 2 fox prog 48 Jul 4 12:07 b/ <br>
-rwxr--r-- 1 fox prog 572 Jul 4 12:07 foo*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a/b: <br>
total 4 <br>
drwxr-xr-x 2 fox prog 48 Jul 4 12:07 ./ <br>
drwxr-xr-x 3 fox prog 64 Jul 4 12:07 ../ <br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 fox prog 700 Jul 4 12:07 bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Some historical implementations of the ls utility show all
entries in a directory except dot and dot-dot when a
superuser invokes ls without specifying the &acirc;a option.
When &lsquo;&lsquo;nor&acirc; <br>
mal&rsquo;&rsquo; users invoke ls without specifying
&acirc;a, they should not see information about any files
with names beginning with a &lt;period&gt; unless they were
named as file operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations are expected to
traverse arbitrary depths when processing the &acirc;R
option. The only limitation on depth should be based on
running out of physical storage for keep&acirc; <br>
ing track of untraversed directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;1 (one) option was
historically found in BSD and BSD-derived implementations
only. It is required in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 so
that conforming applications might ensure <br>
that output is one entry per line, even if the output is to
a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;S option was added in
Issue 7, but had been provided by several implementations
for many years. The description given in the standard
documents historic practice, but does <br>
not match much of the documentation that described its
behavior. Historical documentation typically described it as
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;S Sort by size (largest
size first) instead of by name. Special character devices
(listed last) are sorted by name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even though the file type was
never considered when sorting the output. Character special
files do typically sort close to the end of the list because
their file size on most <br>
implementations is zero. But they are sorted alphabetically
with any other files that happen to have the same file size
(zero), not sorted separately and added to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 is frequently silent about what happens
when mutually-exclusive options are specified. Except for
&acirc;R, &acirc;d, and &acirc;f, the ls utility is required
to accept <br>
multiple options from each mutually-exclusive option set
without treating them as errors and to use the behavior
specified by the last option given in each
mutually-exclusive <br>
set. Since ls is one of the most aliased commands, it is
important that the implementation perform intuitively. For
example, if the alias were:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias ls=&quot;ls
&acirc;C&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the user typed ls &acirc;1
(one), single-text-column output should result, not an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;g, &acirc;l (ell),
&acirc;n, and &acirc;o options are not mutually-exclusive
options. They all enable long format output. They work
together to determine whether the file&rsquo;s owner is
written <br>
(no if &acirc;g is present), file&rsquo;s group is written
(no if &acirc;o is present), and if the file&rsquo;s group
or owner is written whether it is written as the name
(default) or a string repre&acirc; <br>
sentation of the UID or GID number (if &acirc;n is present).
The &acirc;C, &acirc;m, &acirc;x, and &acirc;1 (one) are
mutually-exclusive options and the first three of these
disable long format output. The &acirc;1 <br>
(one) option does not directly change whether or not long
format output is enabled, but by overriding &acirc;C,
&acirc;m, and &acirc;x, it can re-enable long format output
that had been disabled <br>
by one of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard did not describe the BSD &acirc;A option (like
&acirc;a, but dot and dot-dot are not written out). It has
been added due to widespread implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations may make
&acirc;q the default for terminals to prevent trojan horse
attacks on terminals with special escape sequences. This is
not required because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some control characters may be
useful on some terminals; for example, a system might write
them as &quot; 01&quot; or &quot;^A&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Special behavior for terminals
is not relevant to applications portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal specified that
the &lt;optional alternate access method flag&gt; had to be
&rsquo;+&rsquo; if there was an alternate access method used
on the file or &lt;space&gt; if there was not. <br>
This was changed to be &lt;space&gt; if there is not and a
single printable character if there is. This was done for
three reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. There are historical
implementations using characters other than
&rsquo;+&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. There are implementations
that vary this character used in that position to
distinguish between various alternate access methods in
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The standard developers did
not want to preclude future specifications that might need a
way to specify more than one alternate access method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nonetheless, implementations
providing a single alternate access method are encouraged to
use &rsquo;+&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard did not have the &acirc;k option, which meant that
the &acirc;s option could not be used portably as its block
size was implementation-defined, and the <br>
units used to specify the number of blocks occupied by files
in a directory in an ls &acirc;l listing were fixed as
512-byte units. The &acirc;k option has been added to
provide a way for <br>
the &acirc;s option to be used portably, and for consistency
it also changes the aforementioned units from 512-byte to
1024-byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;date and time&gt; field
in the &acirc;l format is specified only for the POSIX
locale. As noted, the format can be different in other
locales. No mechanism for defining this is <br>
present in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, as the
appropriate vehicle is a messaging system; that is, the
format should be specified as a
&lsquo;&lsquo;message&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
Allowing &acirc;f to ignore the &acirc;A, &acirc;g,
&acirc;l, &acirc;n, &acirc;o, and &acirc;s options may be
removed in a future version.</p>
