graphdraw implements a graph (node/edge) editor. graphdraw adds two new
  graphical objects to idraw/drawtool: an elliptical shaped node and a directed
  edge represented as an arrow line. Two new tools to create these objects are
  provided at the bottom of the toolbar. The Node tool (selectable by the 'N'
  key) takes a single mouse click and creates a new graph node at the click
  location. The Edge tool (selectable by the 'E' key) lets you drag a line to
  create a new graph edge. If an edge is drawn from or to an existing node, it
  will connect itself to the node(s) and maintain that connectivity during any
  later movement of nodes or edges. The Move tool will move edges or nodes,
  rubberbanding the rest of the graph, and redrawing any connected edges to
  maintain graph connectivity and edge alignment.

Nodes contain a (initially empty) text string which can be edited by applying
  the Alter tool to a node. A single click on a node while on the Alter tool
  will create a text cursor, possibly within an existing text string, and allow
  editing of the text via the usual Emacs editing commands. A click outside the
  text terminates editing and causes the new text to be centered within the
  node.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For Node and Edge objects, the Selection highlight mechanism has also been
  changed from the usual drawing of &quot;handles&quot; around a graphical
  object to a red foreground color. When Nodes or Edges are selected, they turn
  red instead of handles being drawn around them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
graphdraw documents are saved/restored in a readable text file. Some of the
  tokens used in the text file are specific to graphdraw (and possibly any
  program derived from graphdraw). graph drawings can be exported to other
  idraw/drawtool applications via the &quot;Export Graphic&quot; command (under
  the File menu). This generates Postscript in a format that idraw can read back
  in, and programs like drawtool can import via &quot;Import Graphic&quot;
  (under the file menu).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A Tools menu has been added to the set of pull-down menus to allow switching
  between a graph editing toolbar and a generic graphics editing toolbar.
