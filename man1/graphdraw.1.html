<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
graphdraw - directed graph editor derived from drawtool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
graphdraw [&rsquo;X-params&rsquo;] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
graphdraw implements a graph (node/edge) editor. graphdraw
adds two new graphical objects to idraw/drawtool: an
elliptical shaped node and a directed edge represented as an
<br>
arrow line. Two new tools to create these objects are
provided at the bottom of the toolbar. The Node tool
(selectable by the &rsquo;N&rsquo; key) takes a single mouse
click and creates a <br>
new graph node at the click location. The Edge tool
(selectable by the &rsquo;E&rsquo; key) lets you drag a line
to create a new graph edge. If an edge is drawn from or to
an existing <br>
node, it will connect itself to the node(s) and maintain
that connectivity during any later movement of nodes or
edges. The Move tool will move edges or nodes, rubberbanding
the <br>
rest of the graph, and redrawing any connected edges to
maintain graph connectivity and edge alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nodes contain a (initially
empty) text string which can be edited by applying the Alter
tool to a node. A single click on a node while on the Alter
tool will create a text cur&acirc; <br>
sor, possibly within an existing text string, and allow
editing of the text via the usual Emacs editing commands. A
click outside the text terminates editing and causes the new
<br>
text to be centered within the node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Node and Edge objects, the
Selection highlight mechanism has also been changed from the
usual drawing of &quot;handles&quot; around a graphical
object to a red foreground color. When <br>
Nodes or Edges are selected, they turn red instead of
handles being drawn around them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">graphdraw documents are
saved/restored in a readable text file. Some of the tokens
used in the text file are specific to graphdraw (and
possibly any program derived from graph&acirc; <br>
draw). graph drawings can be exported to other
idraw/drawtool applications via the &quot;Export
Graphic&quot; command (under the File menu). This generates
Postscript in a format that <br>
idraw can read back in, and programs like drawtool can
import via &quot;Import Graphic&quot; (under the file
menu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Tools menu has been added to
the set of pull-down menus to allow switching between a
graph editing toolbar and a generic graphics editing
toolbar.</p>
