<p>PMSOCKS(1) General Commands Manual PMSOCKS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmsocks - shell wrapper for performance monitoring across
firewalls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmsocks path [args ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmsocks allows Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) clients running on
hosts located on the internal side of a TCP/IP firewall to
monitor remote hosts on the other side of the firewall. <br>
This assumes the firewall has been configured with a
compliant sockd daemon and the necessary access controls are
satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
pmsocks uses the tsocks(5) library, which is not included
with PCP. You can get tsocks from
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~delius/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRIX CONFIGURATION <br>
On IRIX, pmsocks is simply a shell wrapper that sets the
appropriate environment variables and then executes the path
program with args arguments (if any). pmsocks works by
set&acirc; <br>
ting the _RLD_LIST environment variable (see rld(1)) to load
a dynamic shared library (see dso(5)) containing stubs for
&lsquo;&lsquo;socksified&rsquo;&rsquo; network library
functions; This &lsquo;&lsquo;socksi&acirc; <br>
fied&rsquo;&rsquo; library is installed at
/usr/pcp/lib/libpcp_socks.so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of conditions
required for this to be successful and the user is strongly
advised to read this whole manual page (in particular the
CAVEAT section below) <br>
before attempting to use pmsocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pmsocks is installed, the
/etc/pcp_socks.conf configuration file is also installed
with minimum default settings. These settings specify that
socket connections to the <br>
local host should be made directly, without contacting any
socks server daemon. This is necessary so that PCP clients
will be able to establish a local connection to the X(1)
<br>
server, and use PCP connections, possibly via a sockd
daemon, to monitor remote hosts. In the present
implementation of pmsocks, non-direct connections to the
X(1) server do not <br>
work, hence if the display is remote, then the remote host
must be on the same side of the firewall and
/etc/pcp_socks.conf must be configured to connect directly
to that host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of
/etc/pcp_socks.conf is identical to /etc/socks.conf as
documented in the CSTC-4.2 socks distribution. This
distribution may be obtained via information contained <br>
in the socks FAQ at <br>
ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/socks/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If other socks clients are being
used, then it is generally safe to remove
/etc/pcp_socks.conf and instead make a symbolic link to
/etc/socks.conf. The file formats are identi&acirc; <br>
cal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default configuration should
be customized to suit the local environment so that
connections to hosts located on the same side of the
firewall as the local host do not use <br>
the socks daemon unnecessarily. The default configuration
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direct LOCALHOSTNAME
255.255.255.255 # direct localhost <br>
sockd 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 # contact sockd everywhere else</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the string
LOCALHOSTNAME is dynamically substituted at run time with
the name of the local host, as obtained by a call to
gethostname(2). Assuming the real IP address <br>
of the local host is 1.2.3.4 and that a normal class-c
subnet is used locally, the most common customization would
be to specify direct connections for all hosts on the local
<br>
subnet, by inserting another
&lsquo;&lsquo;direct&rsquo;&rsquo; line as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direct LOCALHOSTNAME
255.255.255.255 # direct localhost <br>
direct 1.2.3.0 255.255.255.0 # direct on local subnet <br>
sockd 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 # contact sockd everywhere else</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of lines is important
- the first line matching the requested destination IP
address during a connect(2) call (after the requested IP
address has been masked by the <br>
third parameter of the /etc/pcp_socks.conf line), specifies
via the first parameter whether to contact the socks daemon
or whether to attempt a direct connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRIX ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
There are several environment variables used by pmsocks as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS_SERVER <br>
Specifies the host name or IP address of the host running
the sockd daemon. Usually this is the name of the firewall
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS_PORT <br>
The TCP/IP port to use when contacting sockd on the
SOCKS_SERVER host. The default is 1080.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS_NS The host name of the
name server to use, usually to resolve the IP address of
SOCKS_SERVER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS_DEBUG <br>
If present in the environment, libpcp_socks will print
debugging information to the stderr stream. There are only
two levels of debugging, on or off. This is only <br>
really useful for the developers because the debugging
information assumes knowledge of the libpcp_socks source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKS_BANNER <br>
If this is set, whenever a client calls libpcp_socks it will
echo a message to stdout containing version information.
This can be useful to check libpcp_socks is work&acirc; <br>
ing in the absence of verbose logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_RLD_LIST pmsocks sets this to
exactly /usr/pcp/lib/libpcp_socks.so:DEFAULT <br>
It is strongly recommended this NOT be set in the
environment of interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT <br>
Specifies the time-out, in seconds, for connections to
pmcd(1). When using pmsocks, this may need to be increased
from the default (5 seconds) due to the additional <br>
delays introduced as a result of using sockd. See PMAPI(3)
for further details about this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEAT <br>
The following notes should be considered carefully:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0) Because sockd can only handle
TCP/IP sockets, pmsocks never attempts to use sockd for
sockets of type SOCK_DGRAM or if the domain parameter in a
call to socket(2) is PF_UNIX <br>
(unix domain sockets should never need to use sockd
anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Some firewall products do not
support &lsquo;&lsquo;socksified&rsquo;&rsquo; applications,
and in these cases, pmsocks cannot be used. In this case, it
will be necessary to configure the firewall <br>
to allow connections through the firewall for the PMCD
communications port, typically tcp/4321.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) The PCP protocol is
TPC/IP-based and works with the socks protocol, but
connections which use UDP/DATAGRAM sockets or remote X11
connections via sockd may not work. If the <br>
remote display host is on the same side of the firewall as
the application, this may be circumvented by configuring the
remote display host to use direct connections - see <br>
above. Also, using X11 display options which use shared
memory may hang the X server when used with pmsocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) If the pmsocks configuration
file is not present, then pmsocks will exit with an error
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) pmsocks uses the locally
configured name server or resolver (see resolver(5)) to
resolve host names to IP addresses. This may or may not be
capable of resolving host names <br>
on the other side of the firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5) When used over a WAN, often
the sockd daemon will be a long way from the application.
This may result in PCP client connections timing out before
connecting to the remote <br>
pmcd. If this is occurring, set the environment variable
PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT to a higher value than the default (5
seconds). Refer to PMAPI(3) for further details about <br>
this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6) When using pmsocks to connect
to pmcd(1), but &lsquo;&lsquo;Connection
Refused&rsquo;&rsquo; error messages are returned, it is not
immediately obvious whether pmcd(1) is returning the error
or <br>
sockd.</p>
