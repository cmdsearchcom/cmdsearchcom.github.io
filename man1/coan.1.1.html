<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
coan - C/C++ configuration analyser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
coan COMMAND [OPTION...] [file...] [directory...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where no files or directories
are specified, input will be read from the standard input.
The output of a command is written either to the standard
output or to new files, <br>
depending upon the command and the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Coan is a tool for investigating configurations of C or C++
source code. A configuration is a (possibly empty) list of
assumptions about the status of some preprocessor symbols
<br>
when the source code is compiled. It may be assumed that a
symbol is defined for the preprocessor, possibly with formal
parameters and possibly with a specified definition, or it
<br>
may be assumed that a symbol is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to understand
that coan shall consider a symbol to be undefined only if
there is an assumption to that effect, or if you use the
--implicit option. By default, a <br>
symbol that is not mentioned in any assumption is considered
to be undetermined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A configuration may be thought
of as list of #define and/or #undef directives that are
applied to every file in the source code to observe their
effects. The source files might <br>
themselves contain #define or #undef directives that are
active under the given configuration and which may influence
its effects. To capture that influence, Coan temporarily
<br>
adds each active #define or #undef directive to the
configuration just for the duration of the source file in
which it is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given a configuration and some
source code, coan can answer a range of questions about how
the source code would appear to the C/C++ preprocessor if
that configuration of <br>
preprocessor symbols had been applied in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most useful of the questions
that coan can answer is: What would the source code look
like if re-written with all of the simplifications that
follow from the given <br>
configuration? Coan can produce the simplified re-write that
answers this question. So, if the source code contains
redundant preprocessor complexities that depend on the
status <br>
of some preprocessor symbols, coan can be given a
configuration that specifies the status of those symbols,
and it will output an new version of the source code from
which those <br>
redundant complexities have been eliminated. Or, if the
source code is obscured by preprocessor logic that
differentiates several variants by reference to preprocessor
symbols, <br>
coan can be given a configuration that specifies any of
these variants and will be able to generate a simpler
version of the source code that represents only the specifed
<br>
variant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source code re-written by coan
is not pre-processed code as produced by the preprocessor.
It still contains comments, macro-invocations, and
#-directives. It is still source <br>
code, but simplified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other questions that coan can
answer include ones about the preprocessor symbols that are
invoked in the source code and their properties under a
given configuration. For <br>
example: What symbol references would appear within active
preprocessor directives under a given configuration, and
could thus influence the preprocessor under that <br>
configuration? What are the macro-expansions of symbol
references? How are those macro-expansions derived? What
integer values would accrue to the symbol references that
can be <br>
evaluated under a given configuration?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coan can also answer a range of
questions about any category of preprocessor directive that
might appear in the source code, e.g. What #include
directives that import system <br>
header files would be active under <br>
a given configuration? When coan is invoked to identify the
symbol references or directives that satisfy certain
criteria, it will output a list of the references or
directives <br>
of interest, and optionally their locations in the source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directives [OPTION...] [file...]
[directory...] <br>
Select preprocessor directives from the input files in
accordance with the options and report them on the standard
output in accordance with the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
These options may be given with any command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fargfile, --file argfile <br>
Read (more) arguments from file argfile. Arguments may be
written free-form, separated by whitespace, in argfile.
These arguments will be parsed exactly as if they were <br>
listed on the commandline at the position of -fargfile.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dsymbol[(param1[,param2...])]=definition,
--define symbol[(param1[,param2...])]=definition <br>
Assume that the macro definition
symbol[(param1[,param2...])]=definition is in force for
processing the input file(s). If =definition is unspecified
then string defaults to <br>
the empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Usymbol, --undef symbol <br>
Assume that the macro symbol is undefined for processing the
input file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --implicit <br>
Assume that any symbol that is not --define-ed is implicitly
--undef-ed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not allowed to
have the perverse effect that an initial invocation, with
arguments, of an unconfigured symbol, e.g. sym(a,b), is
expanded as 0(a,b) to provoke <br>
a syntax error. The invocation is taken to imply that sym
has a conforming but unknown definition and is passed
through unresolved. However, once sym has been invoked
either <br>
with arguments or without then subsequent invocations are
expected to be of the same form unless sym is redefined or
undefined in the meanwhile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --recurse <br>
Recurse into directories to find input files. (With the
source command, --recurse implies --replace). With
--recurse, the input files may include directories:
otherwise a <br>
directory provokes a non-fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files beneath a directory
will be selected for input unless the --filter option is
given: otherwise all files will be selected that match the
--filter option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --recurse is in effect,
coan builds a graph of all unique input files once and for
all as it parses the filenames that are explicitly supplied
and before it processes <br>
any of them. New files that may later appear in input
directories during execution will not be processed, and
files that have disappeared from input directories when they
are <br>
due to be processed will provoke fatal errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fext1[,ext2...], --filter
ext1[,ext2...] <br>
Process only input files that have one of the file
extensions ext1,ext2... A file extension is the terminal
segment of a filename that immediately follows the final
&rsquo;.&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g[p|i|w|e|a], --gag [progress |
info | warning | error | abend] <br>
Suppress diagnostics no worse than [progress | info |
warning | error | abend].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gs, --gag summary. <br>
Suppress summary diagnostics at end of input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Output all diagnostics,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -V nor -garg is
specified defaults are -gp -gi -gs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --evalconsts <br>
Constants occurring as truth-functional operands in #if
expressions shall be evaluated and eliminated. By default
constants as truth-functional operands are treated as <br>
unknowns, i.e. like macros that are not subject to any
assumptions. Constants are always evaluated and eliminated
when they are arithmetic or bitwise operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour preserves
&quot;work-in-progress&quot; directives such as #if 1 and
#if 0 along with the code they control. With --evalconsts
these directives are evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --keepgoing <br>
If a parse error is encountered in an input file, continue
processing subsequent input files. An event of severity
abend will terminate processing regardless of
--keepgoing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-transients <br>
By default an in-source #define SYM or #undef SYM directive
is transiently treated as a -DSYM or -USYM option within the
source file where it is found. This option suppresses <br>
the default behaviour at your own risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pod <br>
Apart from #-directives, input is to be treated as Plain Old
Data. C or C++ comments and quotations will not be
parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE source COMMAND
<br>
-r, --replace <br>
Replace each input file with the corresponding output file.
This option must be specified to process multiple input
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option changes the default
behaviour of the command when no input files are specified.
In that case, input is acquired from the standard input. If
--replace is not <br>
specified, then a single input file is read from the
standard input. If --replace is specified then the names of
the input files are read from the standard input. Note that
<br>
the --recurse option implies --replace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to preserve the
original files with the --replace option, use the --backup
option as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the names of the input files
are read from stdin, the filenames are delimited by
whitespace unless enclosed in double-quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bsuffix, --backup suffix <br>
Backup each input file before replacing it, the backup file
having the same name as the input file with suffix appended
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x[d|c|e], --conflict [delete |
comment | error] <br>
Select the action to be taken when a #define or #undef
directive is encountered in an input file that conflicts
with one of the -D or -U assumptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, delete: Delete the
conflicting directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, comment: Replace the
conflicting directive with a diagnostic comment
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e, error: Replace the
conflicting directive with a diagnostic #error
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k[d|b|c], --discard [drop |
blank | comment] <br>
Select the policy for discarding lines from output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, drop: Drop discarded
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b, blank: Blank discarded
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, comment: Comment out
discarded lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line <br>
Output #line directives in place of discarded lines to
preserve the line numbers of retained lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --complement <br>
Ouput the lines that ought to be dropped and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE spin COMMAND
<br>
The --recurse and --replace options are implied for this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x[d|c|e], --conflict [delete |
comment | error] <br>
Select the action to be taken when a #define or #undef
directive is encountered in an input file that conflicts
with one of the -D or -U assumptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, delete: Delete the
conflicting directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, comment: Replace the
conflicting directive with a diagnostic comment
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e, error: Replace the
conflicting directive with a diagnostic #error
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k[d|b|c], --discard [drop |
blank | comment] <br>
Select the policy for discarding lines from output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, drop: Drop discarded
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b, blank: Blank discarded
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, comment: Comment out
discarded lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line <br>
Output #line directives in place of discarded lines to
preserve the line numbers of retained lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --complement <br>
Ouput the lines that ought to be dropped and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dir dirname <br>
Generate a spin under the directory dirname. The output
files are generated relative to dirname, mirroring their
original structure. dirname and subdirectories will be <br>
created as required. Pre-existing output files will be
overwritten. A fatal error is given if dirname includes, or
is included by or is identical with any input directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppathame, --prefix pathname
<br>
In organising output files beneath the spin directory dir,
dir will equated with the path prefix pathname of any input
file. This enables any common prefix of all input files <br>
to be deleted from all the outout files under dir if
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE symbols COMMAND
<br>
-i, --ifs <br>
List symbol references that occur in #if, #if[n]def and
#elif directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --defs <br>
List symbol references that occur in #define directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --undefs <br>
List symbol references that occur in #undef directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--includes <br>
List symbol references that occur in #include
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lns <br>
List symbol references that occur in #line directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of -i, -d, -u,
--includes or --lns is given then they are all defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --once-only <br>
List only the first ocurrence of each distinct reference of
a symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once-per-file <br>
List only the first ocurrence per input file of each
distinct reference of a symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --once-only nor
--once-per-file is given then all of a symbol&rsquo;s
references are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --active <br>
List only references from operative directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --inactive <br>
List only references from inoperative directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --locate <br>
Report the source file and line number of each listed
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --expand <br>
Report the macro expansion of each reported symbol
reference, and the integer to which it evaluates, if any. An
expansion will be reported for a reference of the symbol
<br>
symbol if symbol is configured by a -Doption or a -U option,
or transiently configured by a #define or #undef directive
in the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case -Dsymbol, the
expansion of symbol is the empty string (since that is the C
preprocessor&rsquo;s default definition for defined
symbols).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case -Usymbol, the
expansion of symbol is the numeral 0 (since 0 is the value
assigned by the preprocessor to an undefined symbol).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case
-Dsymbol[(param1[,param2...])]=definition, the expansion of
the reference is the string that results by, first,
substituting the arguments of the references, if <br>
any, for the corresponding formal parameters of the symbol
in its definition and then recursively replacing each symbol
reference in the result with its expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a symbol is not configured
then its references are reported as insoluble. Likewise if
it is configured but a reference has a circular
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--explain <br>
Report the successive steps of macro expansion for each
reported symbol reference. Implies --expand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--select name1[*][,name2[*]...]
<br>
Select by name the symbols to be reported. A symbol
reference will be reported only if its name matches one of
the comma-separated names or *-terminated names. A <br>
*-terminated name is interpreted as a wildcard name prefix.
If not specified then --select * is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE includes COMMAND
<br>
-s, --system <br>
List system headers, e.g. &lt;header.h&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --local <br>
List local headers, e.g. &quot;header.h&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -s or -L is given
then both are defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --once-only <br>
List only the first occurrence of each header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once-per-file <br>
List only the first occurrence per input file of each
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --once-only nor
--once-per-file is given then all occurrences of a header
are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --active <br>
List only headers from operative directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --inactive <br>
List only headers from inoperative directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --locate <br>
Report the source file and line number of each listed
occurrence</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE defs COMMAND
<br>
-o, --once-only <br>
List only the first occurrence of each distinct #define or
#undef directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once-per-file <br>
List only the first occurrence per input file of each
distinct #define or #undef directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the purpose of determining
whether two occurrences express the same directive or not,
coan reduces the text of each occurrence to a canonical
form, i.e. all comments are <br>
stripped out, all whitespace sequences are collapsed to a
single space and all tokens are separated by a single space.
This applies for all commands that accept the <br>
--once-only or --once-per-file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --once-only nor
--once-per-file is given then all occurrences of a distinct
#define or #undef directive are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --active <br>
List only operative #define and #undef directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --inactive <br>
List only inoperative #define and #undef directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --locate <br>
Report the source file and line number of each listed
occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE pragmas COMMAND
<br>
-o, --once-only <br>
List only the first occurrence of each distinct pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once-per-file <br>
List only the first occurrence per input file of each
distinct pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --once-only nor
--once-per-file is given then all occurrences of a pragma
are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --active <br>
List only operative pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --inactive <br>
List only inoperative pragmas.</p>

Report the source file and line number of each listed
occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE errors COMMAND
<br>
-o, --once-only <br>
List only the first occurrence of each #error directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once-per-file <br>
List only the first occurrence per input file of each #error
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --once-only nor
--once-per-file is given then all occurrences of a distinct
#error directive are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --active <br>
List only operative #error directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --inactive <br>
List only inoperative #error directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --locate <br>
Report the source file and line number of each listed
occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once-per-file <br>
List only the first occurrence per input file of each

List only operative directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --inactive <br>
List only inoperative directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --locate <br>
Report the source file and line number of each listed
occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Diagnostics written to stderr are classified by severity.
Each diagnostic includes a distinct hexadecimal code of the
form 0xXXXXX that encodes its severity. The 5 <br>
severities are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progress: Progress messages
(0xXXXXX &amp; 0x00800 is true)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: Noteworthy information
(0xXXXXX &amp; 0x01000 is true)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: Indicating problematic
input (0xXXXXX &amp; 0x02000 is true)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error: Indicating invalid input
(0xXXXXX &amp; 0x04000 is true)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abend: Indicating a fatal
environment or internal error (0xXXXXX &amp; 0x08000 is
true)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --gag summary is not in
force, coan can write summary diagnostics at the end of
processing. A summary diagnostic has a hexadecimal code S
that encodes one of the severities <br>
and in addition S &amp; 0x10000 is true. Even if --gag
summary is not in force, a summary will not be written if
its severity is suppressed by one of the specified or
default --gag <br>
options. Since all summaries have severity info or warning,
and since the --gag defaults are info, warning and summary,
you should specify --gag info to see only warning <br>
summaries, and to see all summaries you should specify
--verbose. The summaries include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: The number of input files
that were reached and the number that were not reached (due
to abend).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: The number of input files
reached that were abandoned (due to errors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there was no abend or error,
then additional summaries are written (unless suppressed)
indicating each of the following outcomes that has
occurred:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: Input lines were dropped
through simplification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info: Input lines were changed
through simplification. If the option --discard comment is
in effect, causing discarded lines to be commented out, then
discarded lines are <br>
counted as changed, not dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: Input lines were
changed to #error directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: #error directives were
operative (either in the input source or as a result of
simplification).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coan returns a system code SC of
which the low order half of the low order byte is always
meaningful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SC &amp; 1: Informational
diagnostics accrued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SC &amp; 2: Warnings diagnostics
accrued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SC &amp; 4: Error diagnostics
accrued. (Input files provoking errors will be unchanged
notwithstanding the --replace option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SC &amp; 8: An abend occurred.
Some input files may not have been reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no error or abend is
indicated, then the high order half of the low order byte is
also meaningful:</p>
