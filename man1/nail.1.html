<i>Mailx</i> is an intelligent mail processing system, which has a command
  syntax reminiscent of <i>ed</i>(1) with lines replaced by messages. It is
  based on Berkeley Mail 8.1, is intended to provide the functionality of the
  POSIX <b>mailx</b> command, and offers extensions for MIME, IMAP, POP3, SMTP,
  and S/MIME. <i>Mailx</i> provides enhanced features for interactive use, such
  as caching and disconnected operation for IMAP, message threading, scoring,
  and filtering. It is also usable as a mail batch language, both for sending
  and receiving mail.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sending_mail"><a class="selflink" href="#Sending_mail">Sending
  mail</a></h2>
To send a message to one or more people, <i>mailx</i> can be invoked with
  arguments which are the names of people to whom the mail will be sent. The
  user is then expected to type in his message, followed by an `control-D' at
  the beginning of a line. The section below Replying to or originating mail,
  describes some features of <i>mailx</i> available to help when composing
  letters.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Reading_mail"><a class="selflink" href="#Reading_mail">Reading
  mail</a></h2>
In normal usage <i>mailx</i> is given no arguments and checks the user's mail
  out of the post office, then prints out a one line header of each message
  found. The current message is initially the first message (numbered 1) and can
  be printed using the print command which can be abbreviated `p'). The user can
  move among the messages much as he moves between lines in <i>ed</i>(1), with
  the commands `+' and `-' moving backwards and forwards, and simple numbers.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Disposing_of_mail"><a class="selflink" href="#Disposing_of_mail">Disposing
  of mail</a></h2>
After examining a message the user can delete `d') the message or reply `r') to
  it. Deletion causes the <i>mailx</i> program to forget about the message. This
  is not irreversible; the message can be undeleted `u') by giving its number,
  or the <i>mailx</i> session can be aborted by giving the exit `x') command.
  Deleted messages will, however, usually disappear never to be seen again.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Specifying_messages"><a class="selflink" href="#Specifying_messages">Specifying
  messages</a></h2>
Commands such as print and delete can be given a list of message numbers as
  arguments to apply to a number of messages at once. Thus ` <i>delete 1 2</i>'
  deletes messages 1 and 2, while ` <i>delete 1-5</i>' deletes messages 1
  through 5. In sorted or threaded mode (see the <i>sort</i> and <i>thread</i>
  commands), ` <i>delete 1-5</i>' deletes the messages that are located between
  (and including) messages 1 through 5 in the sorted/threaded order, as shown in
  the header summary. The following special message names exist:

A practical method to read a set of messages is to issue a <i>from</i> command

The <i>reply</i> command can be used to set up a response to a message, sending
  it back to the person who it was from. Text the user types in then, up to an
  end-of-file, defines the contents of the message. While the user is composing
  a message, <i>mailx</i> treats lines beginning with the character `~'
  specially. For instance, typing `~m' (alone on a line) will place a copy of
  the current message into the response right shifting it by a tabstop (see
  <i>indentprefix</i> variable, below). Other escapes will set up subject
  fields, add and delete recipients to the message, attach files to it and allow
  the user to escape to an editor to revise the message or to a shell to run
  some commands. (These options are given in the summary below.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Ending_a_mail_processing_session"><a class="selflink" href="#Ending_a_mail_processing_session">Ending
  a mail processing session</a></h2>
The user can end a <i>mailx</i> session with the quit (`q') command. Messages
  which have been examined go to the user's mbox file unless they have been
  deleted in which case they are discarded. Unexamined messages go back to the
  post office. (See the -f option above).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Personal_and_systemwide_distribution_lists"><a class="selflink" href="#Personal_and_systemwide_distribution_lists">Personal
  and systemwide distribution lists</a></h2>
It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for
  instance, the user can send mail to ` <i>cohorts</i>' and have it go to a
  group of people. Such lists can be defined by placing a line like
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
         <b>alias</b><i> cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
in the file .mailrc in the user's home directory. The current list of such
  aliases can be displayed with the alias command in <i>mailx</i>. System wide
  distribution lists can be created by editing /etc/aliases, see
  <i>aliases</i>(5) and <i>sendmail</i>(8); these are kept in a different
  syntax. In mail the user sends, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent
  to others so that they will be able to reply to the recipients. System wide
  aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent, but any reply returned to the
  machine will have the system wide alias expanded as all mail goes through
  sendmail.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Recipient_address_specifications"><a class="selflink" href="#Recipient_address_specifications">Recipient
  address specifications</a></h2>
If the <i>expandaddr</i> option is not set (the default), recipient addresses
  must be names of local mailboxes or Internet mail addresses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>expandaddr</i> option is set, the following rules apply: When an
  address is used to name a recipient (in any of To, Cc, or Bcc), names of local
  mail folders and pipes to external commands can also be specified; the message
  text is then written to them. The rules are: Any name which starts with a
  `<b>|</b>' character specifies a pipe, the command string following the `|' is
  executed and the message is sent to its standard input; any other name which
  contains a `<b>@</b>' character is treated as a mail address; any other name
  which starts with a `<b>+</b>' character specifies a folder name; any other
  name which contains a `<b>/</b>' character but no `<b>!</b>' or `<b>%</b>'
  character before also specifies a folder name; what remains is treated as a
  mail address. Compressed folders are handled as described for the
  <i>folder</i> command below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Network_mail_(Internet_/_ARPA,_UUCP,_Berknet)"><a class="selflink" href="#Network_mail_(Internet_/_ARPA,_UUCP,_Berknet)">Network
  mail (Internet / ARPA, UUCP, Berknet)</a></h2>
See <i>mailaddr</i>(7) for a description of network addresses. <i>Mailx</i> has
  a number of options which can be set in the .mailrc file to alter its
  behavior; thus ` <i>set askcc</i>' enables the askcc feature. (These options
  are summarized below).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MIME_types"><a class="selflink" href="#MIME_types">MIME
  types</a></h2>
For any outgoing attachment, <i>mailx</i> tries to determine the content type.
  It does this by reading MIME type files whose lines have the following syntax:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
         <i>type</i><b>/</b><i>subtype      extension </i>[<i>extension </i>.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.]
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
where type/subtype are strings describing the file contents, and extension is
  the part of a filename starting after the last dot. Any line not immediately
  beginning with an ASCII alphabetical character is ignored by <i>mailx</i>. If
  there is a match with the extension of the file to attach, the given
  type/subtype pair is used. Otherwise, or if the filename has no extension, the
  content types text/plain or application/octet-stream are used, the first for
  text or international text files, the second for any file that contains
  formatting characters other than newlines and horizontal tabulators.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Character_sets"><a class="selflink" href="#Character_sets">Character
  sets</a></h2>
<i>Mailx</i> normally detects the character set of the terminal using the
  LC_CTYPE locale setting. If the locale cannot be used appropriately, the
  <i>ttycharset</i> variable should be set to provide an explicit value. When
  reading messages, their text is converted to the terminal character set if
  possible. Unprintable characters and illegal byte sequences are detected and
  replaced by Unicode substitute characters or question marks unless the
  <i>print-all-chars</i> is set at initialization time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The character set for outgoing messages is not necessarily the same as the one
  used on the terminal. If an outgoing text message contains characters not
  representable in US-ASCII, the character set being used must be declared
  within its header. Permissible values can be declared using the
  <i>sendcharsets</i> variable, separated by commas; <i>mailx</i> tries each of
  the values in order and uses the first appropriate one. If the message
  contains characters that cannot be represented in any of the given character
  sets, the message will not be sent, and its text will be saved to the
  `dead.letter' file. Messages that contain NUL bytes are not converted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Outgoing attachments are converted if they are plain text. If the
  <i>sendcharsets</i> variable contains more than one character set name, the
  <i>~@</i> tilde escape will ask for the character sets for individual
  attachments if it is invoked without arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Best results are usually achieved when <i>mailx</i> is run in a UTF-8 locale on
  a UTF-8 capable terminal. In this setup, characters from various countries can
  be displayed, while it is still possible to use more simple character sets for
  sending to retain maximum compatibility with older mail clients.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Commands">Commands</a></h2>
Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take arguments following the
  command word. The command need not be typed in its entirety &#x2013; the first
  command which matches the typed prefix is used. For commands which take
  message lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then the next message
  forward which satisfies the command's requirements is used. If there are no
  messages forward of the current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if
  there are no good messages at all, <i>mailx</i> types `<i>applicable
  messages</i>' and aborts the command. If the command begins with a <i>#</i>
  sign, the line is ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes
      &quot;&quot; or single-quotes ''; any white space, shell word expansion,
      or backslash characters within the quotes are treated literally as part of
      the argument. A double-quote will be treated literally within
      single-quotes and vice versa. These special properties of the quote marks
      occur only when they are paired at the beginning and end of the
    argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes is discarded
      and the following character is treated literally as part of the
    argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An unquoted backslash at the end of a command line is
      discarded and the next line continues the command.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Filenames, where expected, are subjected to the following transformations, in
  sequence:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the filename begins with an unquoted plus sign, and the
      <i>folder</i> variable is defined, the plus sign will be replaced by the
      value of the <i>folder</i> variable followed by a slash. If the
      <i>folder</i> variable is unset or is set to null, the filename will be
      unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Shell word expansions are applied to the filename. If more
      than a single pathname results from this expansion and the command is
      expecting one file, an error results.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following commands are provided:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print out the preceding message. If given a numeric
      argument n, goes to the n'th previous message and prints it.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>account</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(ac) Creates, selects or lists an email account. An account
      is formed by a group of commands, primarily of those to set variables.
      With two arguments, of which the second is a `{', the first argument gives
      an account name, and the following lines create a group of commands for
      that account until a line containing a single `}' appears. With one
      argument, the previously created group of commands for the account name is
      executed, and a <i>folder</i> command is executed for the system mailbox
      or inbox of that account. Without arguments, the list of accounts and
      their contents are printed. As an example,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
     <b>account</b><i> myisp</i> <b>{</b>
        set folder=imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>folder</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(fold) The folder command switches to a new mail file or

      reading. If an argument is given, it will write out changes (such as
      deletions) the user has made in the current file and read in the new file.
      Some special conventions are recognized for the name. <b>#</b> means the

      <b>%</b><i>user</i> means <i>user's</i> system mailbox, <b>&amp;</b> means
      the invoking user's mbox file, and <b>+</b><i>file</i><i> means a

      to the same value as <i>filespec</i>, but the file is handled as a system
      mailbox e.&#x00A0;g. by the mbox and save commands. If the name matches
      one of the strings defined with the <i>shortcut</i> command, it is
      replaced by its long form and expanded. If the name ends with <b>.gz</b>
      or <b>.bz2</b>, it is treated as compressed with <i>gzip</i>(1) or
      <i>bzip2</i>(1), respectively. Likewise, if <i>name</i> does not exist,
      but either <i>name</i><b>.gz</b> or <i>name</i><b>.bz2</b> exists, the
      compressed file is used. If <i>name</i> refers to a directory with the

      currently <b>imap</b> (IMAP v4r1), <b>imaps</b> (IMAP with SSL/TLS
      encryption), <b>pop3</b> (POP3), and <b>pop3s</b> (POP3 with SSL/TLS
      encryption). If <i>user</i> contains special characters, in particular `/'
      or `%', they must be escaped in URL notation, as `%2F' or `%25'. The
      optional <i>file</i> part applies to IMAP only; if it is omitted, the
      default `INBOX' is used. If <i>mailx</i> is connected to an IMAP server, a
      name of the form <b>@</b><i>mailbox</i> refers to the <i>mailbox</i> on
      that server. If the `folder' variable refers to an IMAP account, the

The <i>mailx</i> command has two distinct usages, according to whether one wants
  to send or receive mail. Sending mail is simple: to send a message to a user
  whose email address is, say, &lt;bill@host.example&gt;, use the shell command:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $  <b>mailx</b><i> bill@host.example</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
then type your message. <i>Mailx</i> will prompt you for a message
  <i>subject</i> first; after that, lines typed by you form the body of the
  message. When you reach the end of the message, type an EOT (control-d) at the
  beginning of a line, which will cause <i>mailx</i> to echo `EOT' and return
  you to the shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If, while you are composing the message you decide that you do not wish to send
  it after all, you can abort the letter with a RUBOUT. Typing a single RUBOUT
  causes <i>mailx</i> to print `(Interrupt -- one more to kill letter)'. Typing
  a second RUBOUT causes <i>mailx</i> to save your partial letter on the file
  `dead.letter' in your home directory and abort the letter. Once you have sent
  mail to someone, there is no way to undo the act, so be careful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to send the same message to several other people, you can list their
  email addresses on the command line. Thus,
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $  <b>mailx</b><i> sam@workstation.example bob@server.example</i>
    Subject: Fees
    Tuition fees are due next Friday.  Don't forget!
    &lt;Control-d&gt;
    EOT
    $
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
will send the reminder to <i>&lt;sam@workstation.example&gt;</i>. and
  <i>&lt;bob@server.example&gt;</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To read your mail, simply type
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $  <b>mailx</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
<i>Mailx</i> will respond by typing its version number and date and then listing
  the messages you have waiting. Then it will type a prompt and await your
  command. The messages are assigned numbers starting with 1&#x2014;you refer to
  the messages with these numbers. <i>Mailx</i> keeps track of which messages
  are <i>new</i> (have been sent since you last read your mail) and <i>read</i>
  (have been read by you). New messages have an <b>N</b> next to them in the
  header listing and old, but unread messages have a <b>U</b> next to them.
  <i>Mailx</i> keeps track of new/old and read/unread messages by putting a
  header field called <i>Status</i> into your messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To look at a specific message, use the <i>type</i> command, which may be
  abbreviated to simply <i>t .</i> For example, if you had the following
  messages:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    O 1 drfoo@myhost.example Wed Sep  1 19:52  18/631 &quot;Fees&quot;
    O 2 sam@friends.example  Thu Sep  2 00:08  30/895
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
you could examine the first message by giving the command:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>type</b> 1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
which might cause <b>mailx</b> to respond with, for example:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Message  1:
    From drfoo@myhost.example Wed Sep  1 19:52:25 2004
    Subject: Fees
    Status: R
<div class="Pp"></div>
    Tuition fees are due next Wednesday.  Don't forget!
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many <i>mailx</i> commands that operate on messages take a message number as an
  argument like the <i>type</i> command. For these commands, there is a notion
  of a current message. When you enter the <i>mailx</i> program, the current
  message is initially the first (or the first recent) one. Thus, you can often
  omit the message number and use, for example,
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>t</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
to type the current message. As a further shorthand, you can type a message by
  simply giving its message number. Hence,
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
would type the first message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Frequently, it is useful to read the messages in your mailbox in order, one
  after another. You can read the next message in <i>mailx</i> by simply typing
  a newline. As a special case, you can type a newline as your first command to
  <i>mailx</i> to type the first message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If, after typing a message, you wish to immediately send a reply, you can do so
  with the <i>reply</i> command. This command, like <i>type</i>, takes a message
  number as an argument. <i>mailx</i> then begins a message addressed to the
  user who sent you the message. You may then type in your letter in reply,
  followed by a &lt;control-d&gt; at the beginning of a line, as before.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <i>mailx</i> copies the subject header from the original message. This
  is useful in that correspondence about a particular matter will tend to retain
  the same subject heading, making it easy to recognize. If there are other
  header fields in the message, like `Cc:', the information found will also be
  used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes you will receive a message that has been sent to several people and
  wish to reply only to the person who sent it. <i>Reply</i> with a capital
  <i>R</i> replies to a message, but sends a copy to the sender only.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you wish, while reading your mail, to send a message to someone, but not as a
  reply to one of your messages, you can send the message directly with the
  <i>mail</i> command, which takes as arguments the names of the recipients you
  wish to send to. For example, to send a message to
  &lt;frank@machine.example&gt;, you would do:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>mail</b><i> frank@machine.example</i>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To delete a message from the mail folder, you can use the <i>delete</i> command.
  In addition to not saving deleted messages, <i>mailx</i> will not let you type
  them, either. The effect is to make the message disappear altogether, along
  with its number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many features of <i>mailx</i> can be tailored to your liking with the <i>set</i>
  command. The <i>set</i> command has two forms, depending on whether you are
  setting a <i>binary</i> option or a <i>valued</i> option. Binary options are
  either on or off. For example, the <i>askcc</i> option informs <i>mailx</i>
  that each time you send a message, you want it to prompt you for a `Cc:'
  header, to be included in the message. To set the <i>askcc</i> option, you
  would type
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>set</b> askcc
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Valued options are values which <i>mailx</i> uses to adapt to your tastes. For
  example, the <i>record</i> option tells <i>mailx</i> where to save messages
  sent by you, and is specified by
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>set</b> record=Sent
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
for example. Note that no spaces are allowed in <i>set record=Sent .</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Mailx</i> includes a simple facility for maintaining groups of messages
  together in folders. To use the folder facility, you must tell <i>mailx</i>
  where you wish to keep your folders. Each folder of messages will be a single
  file. For convenience, all of your folders are kept in a single directory of
  your choosing. To tell <i>mailx</i> where your folder directory is, put a line
  of the form
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>set folder=</b><i>letters</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
in your <i>.mailrc</i> file. If, as in the example above, your folder directory
  does not begin with a `/', <i>mailx</i> will assume that your folder directory
  is to be found starting from your home directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anywhere a file name is expected, you can use a folder name, preceded with `+'.
  For example, to put a message into a folder with the <i>save</i> command, you
  can use:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>save +</b><i>classwork</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
to save the current message in the <i>classwork</i> folder. If the
  <i>classwork</i> folder does not yet exist, it will be created. Note that
  messages which are saved with the <i>save</i> command are automatically
  removed from your system mailbox.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to make a copy of a message in a folder without causing that message to
  be removed from your system mailbox, use the <i>copy</i> command, which is
  identical in all other respects to the <i>save</i> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>folder</i> command can be used to direct <i>mailx</i> to the contents of
  a different folder. For example,
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>folder +</b><i>classwork</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
directs <i>mailx</i> to read the contents of the <i>classwork</i> folder. All of
  the commands that you can use on your system mailbox are also applicable to
  folders, including <i>type</i>, <i>delete</i>, and <i>reply</i>. To inquire
  which folder you are currently editing, use simply:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>folder</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To list your current set of folders, use the <i>folders</i> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the <i>help</i> command is available to print out a brief summary of
  the most important <i>mailx</i> commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While typing in a message to be sent to others, it is often useful to be able to
  invoke the text editor on the partial message, print the message, execute a
  shell command, or do some other auxiliary function. <i>Mailx</i> provides
  these capabilities through <i>tilde escapes ,</i> which consist of a tilde (~)
  at the beginning of a line, followed by a single character which indicates the
  function to be performed. For example, to print the text of the message so
  far, use:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>~p</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
which will print a line of dashes, the recipients of your message, and the text
  of the message so far. A list of the most important tilde escapes is available
  with `~?'.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IMAP_or_POP3_client_setup"><a class="selflink" href="#IMAP_or_POP3_client_setup">IMAP
  or POP3 client setup</a></h2>
First you need the following data from your ISP: the host name of the IMAP or
  POP3 server, user name and password for this server, and a notice whether the
  server uses SSL/TLS encryption. Assuming the host name is
  `server.myisp.example' and your user name for that server is `mylogin', you
  can refer to this account using the <i>folder</i> command or <i>-f</i> command
  line option with
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>imaps://</b><i>mylogin</i><b>@</b><i>server.myisp.example</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
(This string is not necessarily the same as your Internet mail address.) You can
  replace `imaps://' with `imap://' if the server does not support SSL/TLS. (If
  SSL/TLS support is built using NSS, the <i>nss-config-dir</i> variable must be
  set before a connection can be initiated, see above). Use `pop3s://' or
  `pop3://' if the server does not offer IMAP. You should use IMAP if you can,
  though; first because it requires fewer network operations than POP3 to get
  the contents of the mailbox and is thus faster; and second because message
  attributes are maintained by the IMAP server, so you can easily distinguish
  new and old messages each time you connect. Even if the server does not accept
  IMAPS or POP3S connections, it is possible that it supports the STARTTLS
  method to make a session SSL/TLS encrypted after the initial connection has
  been performed, but before authentication begins. The only reliable method to
  see if this works is to try it; enter one of
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set imap-use-starttls</b>
     <b>set pop3-use-starttls</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
before you initiate the connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As you probably want messages to be deleted from this account after saving them,
  prefix it with ` <i>%:</i>'. The <i>shortcut</i> command can be used to avoid
  typing that many characters every time you want to connect:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>shortcut </b><i>myisp</i><b> </b><b>%:imaps://</b><i>mylogin</i><b>@</b><i>server.myisp.example</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
You might want to put this string into a startup file. As the <i>shortcut</i>
  command is specific to this implementation of <i>mailx</i> and will confuse
  other implementations, it should not be used in <i>~/.mailrc</i>, instead, put
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set NAIL_EXTRA_RC=</b><i>~/.nailrc</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
in <i>~/.mailrc</i> and create a file <i>~/.nailrc</i> containing the
  <i>shortcut</i> command above. You can then access your remote mailbox by
  invoking `mailx -f <i>myisp</i>' on the command line, or by executing `fi
  <i>myisp</i>' within mailx.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to use more than one IMAP mailbox on a server, or if you want to use
  the IMAP server for mail storage too, the <i>account</i> command (which is
  also <i>mailx-</i>specific) is more appropriate than the <i>shortcut</i>
  command. You can put the following in <i>~/.nailrc</i>:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
     <b>account </b><i>myisp </i><b>{</b>
         <b>set folder=imaps://</b><i>mylogin</i><b>@</b><i>server.myisp.example</i>
         <b>set record=+</b><i>Sent </i><b>MBOX=+</b><i>mbox </i><b>outfolder</b>
     <b>}</b>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and can then access incoming mail for this account by invoking `mailx -A
  <i>myisp</i>' on the command line, or by executing `ac <i>myisp</i>' within
  mailx. After that, a command like `copy <i>1</i> +<i>otherfolder</i>' will
  refer to <i>otherfolder</i> on the IMAP server. In particular, `fi &amp;' will
  change to the <i>mbox</i> folder, and `fi +Sent' will show your recorded sent
  mail, with both folders located on the IMAP server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Mailx</i> will ask you for a password string each time you connect to a
  remote account. If you can reasonably trust the security of your workstation,
  you can give this password in the startup file as
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set password-</b><i>mylogin</i><b>@</b><i>server.myisp.example</i><b>=&quot;</b><i>SECRET</i><b>&quot;</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
You should change the permissions of this file to 0600, see <i>chmod</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Mailx</i> supports different authentication methods for both IMAP and POP3.
  If Kerberos is used at your location, you can try to activate GSSAPI-based
  authentication by
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set imap-auth=gssapi</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
The advantage of this method is that <i>mailx</i> does not need to know your
  password at all, nor needs to send sensitive data over the network. Otherwise,
  the options
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set imap-auth=cram-md5</b>
     <b>set pop3-use-apop</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
for IMAP and POP3, respectively, offer authentication methods that avoid to send
  the password in clear text over the network, which is especially important if
  SSL/TLS cannot be used. If the server does not offer any of these
  authentication methods, conventional user/password based authentication must
  be used. It is sometimes helpful to set the <i>verbose</i> option when
  authentication problems occur. <i>Mailx</i> will display all data sent to the
  server in clear text on the screen with this option, including passwords. You
  should thus take care that no unauthorized person can look at your terminal
  when this option is set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you regularly use the same workstation to access IMAP accounts, you can
  greatly enhance performance by enabling local caching of IMAP messages. For
  any message that has been fully or partially fetched from the server, a local
  copy is made and is used when the message is accessed again, so most data is
  transferred over the network once only. To enable the IMAP cache, select a
  local directory name and put
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set imap-cache=</b><i>~/localdirectory</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
in the startup file. All files within that directory can be overwritten or
  deleted by <i>mailx</i> at any time, so you should not use the directory to
  store other information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once the cache contains some messages, it is not strictly necessary anymore to
  open a connection to the IMAP server to access them. When <i>mailx</i> is
  invoked with the <i>-D</i> option, or when the <i>disconnected</i> variable is
  set, only cached data is used for any folder you open. Messages that have not
  yet been completely cached are not available then, but all other messages can
  be handled as usual. Changes made to IMAP mailboxes in <i>disconnected</i>
  mode are committed to the IMAP server next time it is used in <i>online</i>
  mode. Synchronizing the local status with the status on the server is thus
  partially within your responsibility; if you forget to initiate a connection
  to the server again before you leave your location, changes made on one
  workstation are not available on others. Also if you alter IMAP mailboxes from
  a workstation while uncommitted changes are still pending on another, the
  latter data may become invalid. The same might also happen because of internal
  server status changes. You should thus carefully evaluate this feature in your
  environment before you rely on it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many servers will close the connection after a short period of inactivity. Use
  one of
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     <b>set pop3-keepalive=</b><i>30</i>
     <b>set imap-keepalive=</b><i>240</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
to send a keepalive message each 30 seconds for POP3, or each 4 minutes for
  IMAP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you encounter problems connecting to a SSL/TLS server, try the
  <i>ssl-rand-egd</i> and <i>ssl-rand-file</i> variables (see the OpenSSL FAQ
  for more information) or specify the protocol version with <i>ssl-method</i>.
  Contact your ISP if you need a client certificate or if verification of the
  server certificate fails. If the failed certificate is indeed valid, fetch its
  CA certificate by executing the shell command
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
    $  <b>openssl s_client &lt;/dev/null -showcerts -connect \</b>
<b>           </b><i>server.myisp.example</i><b>:</b><i>imaps</i><b> 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee </b><i>log</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
(see <i>s_client</i>(1)) and put it into the file specified with
  <i>ssl-ca-file</i>. The data you need is located at the end of the certificate
  chain within (and including) the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE' and `END CERTIFICATE'
  lines. (Note that it is possible to fetch a forged certificate by this method.
  You can only completely rely on the authenticity of the CA certificate if you
  fetch it in a way that is trusted by other means, such as by personally
  receiving the certificate on storage media.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Creating_a_score_file_or_message_filter"><a class="selflink" href="#Creating_a_score_file_or_message_filter">Creating
  a score file or message filter</a></h2>
The scoring commands are best separated from other configuration for clarity,
  and are mostly <i>mailx</i> specific. It is thus recommended to put them in a
  separate file that is sourced from your NAIL_EXTRA_RC as follows:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>source</b><i> ~/.scores</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
The <i>.scores</i> file could then look as follows:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>define</b> <i>list</i> {
         <b>score</b> (subject &quot;important discussion&quot;) +10
         <b>score</b> (subject &quot;annoying discussion&quot;) -10
         <b>score</b> (from &quot;nicefellow@goodnet&quot;) +15
         <b>score</b> (from &quot;badguy@poornet&quot;) -5
         <b>move</b> (header x-spam-flag &quot;+++++&quot;) <i>+junk</i>
    }
     <b>set folder-hook-</b>imap://user@host/public.list=<i>list</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
In this scheme, you would see any mail from `nicefellow@goodnet', even if the
  surrounding discussion is annoying; but you normally would not see mail from
  `badguy@poornet', unless he participates in the important discussion. Messages
  that are marked with five or more plus characters in their `X-Spam-Flag' field
  (inserted by some server-side filtering software) are moved to the folder
  `junk' in the <i>folder</i> directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be aware that all criteria in () lead to substring matches, so you would also
  score messages from e.g. `notsobadguy@poornetmakers' negative here. It is
  possible to select addresses exactly using <i>&quot;address&quot;</i> message
  specifications, but these cannot be executed remotely and will thus cause all
  headers to be downloaded from IMAP servers while looking for matches.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When searching messages on an IMAP server, best performance is usually achieved
  by sending as many criteria as possible in one large () specification, because
  each single such specification will result in a separate network operation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Activating_the_Bayesian_filter"><a class="selflink" href="#Activating_the_Bayesian_filter">Activating
  the Bayesian filter</a></h2>
The Bayesian junk mail filter works by examining the words contained in
  messages. You decide yourself what a good and what a bad message is. Thus the
  resulting filter is your very personal one; once it is correctly set up, it
  will filter only messages similar to those previously specified by you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use the Bayesian filter, a location for the junk mail database must be
  defined first:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>set junkdb=</b><i>~/.junkdb</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
The junk mail database does not contain actual words extracted from messages,
  but hashed representations of them. A foreign person who can read the database
  could only examine the frequency of previously known words in your mail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have sufficient disk space (several 10&#x00A0;MB) available, it is
  recommended that you set the <i>chained-junk-tokens</i> option. The filter
  will then also consider two-word tokens, improving its accuracy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A set of good messages and junk messages must now be available; it is also
  possible to use the incoming new messages for this purpose, although it will
  of course take some time until the filter becomes useful then. Do not
  underestimate the amount of statistical data needed; some hundred messages are
  typically necessary to get satisfactory results, and many thousand messages
  for best operation. You have to pass the good messages to the <i>good</i>
  command, and the junk messages to the <i>junk</i> command. If you ever
  accidentally mark a good message as junk or vice-versa, call the <i>ungood</i>
  or <i>unjunk</i> command to correct this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a reasonable amount of statistics has been collected, new messages can be
  classified automatically. The <i>classify</i> command marks all messages that
  the filter considers to be junk, but it does not perform any action on them by
  default. It is recommended that you move these messages into a separate folder
  just for the case that false positives occur, or to pass them to the
  <i>junk</i> command later again to further improve the junk mail database. To
  automatically move incoming junk messages every time the inbox is opened, put
  lines like the following into your <i>.scores</i> file (or whatever name you
  gave to the file in the last example):
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>define</b> <i>junkfilter</i> {
         <b>classify (smaller </b><i>20000</i><b>) :n</b>
         <b>move :j</b> <i>+junk</i>
    }
     <b>set folder-hook-</b>imap://user@host/INBOX=<i>junkfilter</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
If you set the <i>verbose</i> option before running the <i>classify</i> command,
  <i>mailx</i> prints the words it uses for calculating the junk status along
  with their statistical probabilities. This can help you to find out why some
  messages are not classified as you would like them to be. To see the
  statistical probability of a given word, use the <i>probability</i> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a junk message was not recognized as such, use the <i>junk</i> command to
  correct this. Also if you encounter a false positive (a good message that was
  wrongly classified as junk), pass it to the <i>good</i> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the <i>classify</i> command must examine the entire text of all new
  messages in the respective folder, this will also cause all of them to be
  downloaded from the IMAP server. You should thus restrict the size of messages
  for automatic filtering. If server-based filtering is also available, you
  might try if that works for you first.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Reading_HTML_mail"><a class="selflink" href="#Reading_HTML_mail">Reading
  HTML mail</a></h2>
You need either the <i>w3m</i> or <i>lynx</i> utility or another command-line

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Signed_and_encrypted_messages_with_S/MIME"><a class="selflink" href="#Signed_and_encrypted_messages_with_S/MIME">Signed
  and encrypted messages with S/MIME</a></h2>
S/MIME provides two central mechanisms: message signing and message encryption.
  A signed message contains some data in addition to the regular text. The data
  can be used to verify that the message was sent using a valid certificate,
  that the sender's address in the message header matches that in the
  certificate, and that the message text has not been altered. Signing a message
  does not change its regular text; it can be read regardless of whether the
  recipient's software is able to handle S/MIME. It is thus usually possible to
  sign all outgoing messages if so desired.&#x2014;Encryption, in contrast,
  makes the message text invisible for all people except those who have access
  to the secret decryption key. To encrypt a message, the specific recipient's
  public encryption key must be known. It is thus not possible to send encrypted
  mail to people unless their key has been retrieved from either previous
  communication or public key directories. A message should always be signed
  before it is encrypted. Otherwise, it is still possible that the encrypted
  message text is altered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A central concept to S/MIME is that of the certification authority (CA). A CA is
  a trusted institution that issues certificates. For each of these
  certificates, it can be verified that it really originates from the CA,
  provided that the CA's own certificate is previously known. A set of CA
  certificates is usually delivered with OpenSSL and installed on your system.
  If you trust the source of your OpenSSL software installation, this offers
  reasonable security for S/MIME on the Internet. In general, a certificate
  cannot be more secure than the method its CA certificate has been retrieved
  with, though. Thus if you download a CA certificate from the Internet, you can
  only trust the messages you verify using that certificate as much as you trust
  the download process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first thing you need for participating in S/MIME message exchange is your
  personal certificate, including a private key. The certificate contains public
  information, in particular your name and your email address, and the public
  key that is used by others to encrypt messages for you, and to verify signed
  messages they supposedly received from you. The certificate is included in
  each signed message you send. The private key must be kept secret. It is used
  to decrypt messages that were previously encrypted with your public key, and
  to sign messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For personal use, it is recommended that you get a S/MIME certificate from one
  of the major CAs on the Internet using your WWW browser. (Many CAs offer such
  certificates for free.) You will usually receive a combined certificate and
  private key in PKCS#12 format which <i>mailx</i> does not directly accept if
  S/MIME support is built using OpenSSL. To convert it to PEM format, use the
  following shell command:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $  <b>openssl pkcs12 -in </b><i>cert.p12</i><b> -out </b><i>cert.pem</i><b> -clcerts \</b>
<b>        -nodes</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
If you omit the <i>-nodes</i> parameter, you can specifiy an additional <i>PEM
  pass phrase</i> for protecting the private key. <i>Mailx</i> will then ask you
  for that pass phrase each time it signs or decrypts a message. You can then
  use
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>set smime-sign-cert-</b><i>myname@myisp.example</i><b>=</b><i>cert.pem</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
to make this private key and certificate known to <i>mailx</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If S/MIME support is built using NSS, the PKCS#12 file must be installed using
  Mozilla (provided that <i>nss-config-dir</i> is set appropriately, see above),
  and no further action is necessary unless multiple user certificates for the
  same email address are installed. In this case, the <i>smime-sign-nickname</i>
  variable has to be set appropriately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can now sign outgoing messages. Just use
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>set smime-sign</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
to do so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
From each signed message you send, the recipient can fetch your certificate and
  use it to send encrypted mail back to you. Accordingly if somebody sends you a
  signed message, you can do the same. First use the <i>verify</i> command to
  check the validity of the certificate. After that, retrieve the certificate
  and tell <i>mailx</i> that it should use it for encryption:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>certsave</b><i> filename</i>
     <b>set smime-encrypt-</b><i>user@host</i><b>=</b><i>filename</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
If S/MIME support is built using NSS, the saved certificate must be installed
  using Mozilla. The value of the <i>smime-encrypt-user@host</i> is ignored
  then, but if multiple certificates for the recipient are available, the
  <i>smime-nickname-user@host</i> variable must be set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should carefully consider if you prefer to store encrypted messages in
  decrypted form. If you do, anybody who has access to your mail folders can
  read them, but if you do not, you might be unable to read them yourself later
  if you happen to lose your private key. The <i>decrypt</i> command saves
  messages in decrypted form, while the <i>save</i>, <i>copy</i>, and
  <i>move</i> commands leave them encrypted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that neither S/MIME signing nor encryption applies to message subjects or
  other header fields. Thus they may not contain sensitive information for
  encrypted messages, and cannot be trusted even if the message content has been
  verified. When sending signed messages, it is recommended to repeat any
  important header information in the message text.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_CRLs_with_S/MIME_or_SSL/TLS"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_CRLs_with_S/MIME_or_SSL/TLS">Using
  CRLs with S/MIME or SSL/TLS</a></h2>
Certification authorities (CAs) issue certificate revocation lists (CRLs) on a
  regular basis. These lists contain the serial numbers of certificates that
  have been declared invalid after they have been issued. Such usually happens
  because the private key for the certificate has been compromised, because the
  owner of the certificate has left the organization that is mentioned in the
  certificate, etc. To seriously use S/MIME or SSL/TLS verification, an
  up-to-date CRL is required for each trusted CA. There is otherwise no method
  to distinguish between valid and invalidated certificates. <i>Mailx</i>
  currently offers no mechanism to fetch CRLs, or to access them on the
  Internet, so you have to retrieve them by some external mechanism.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using OpenSSL, <i>mailx</i> accepts CRLs
  in PEM format only; CRLs in DER format must be converted, e.g. with the shell
  command
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $  <b>openssl crl -inform DER -in </b><i>crl.der</i><b> -out </b><i>crl.pem</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
To tell <i>mailx</i> about the CRLs, a directory that contains all CRL files
  (and no other files) must be created. The <i>smime-crl-dir</i> or
  <i>ssl-crl-dir</i> variables, respectively, must then be set to point to that
  directory. After that, <i>mailx</i> requires a CRL to be present for each CA
  that is used to verify a certificate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If S/MIME and SSL/TLS support are built using NSS, CRLs can be imported in
  Mozilla applications (provided that <i>nss-config-dir</i> is set
  appropriately).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sending_mail_from_scripts"><a class="selflink" href="#Sending_mail_from_scripts">Sending
  mail from scripts</a></h2>
If you want to send mail from scripts, you must be aware that <i>mailx</i> reads
  the user's configuration files by default. So unless your script is only
  intended for your own personal use (as e.g. a cron job), you need to
  circumvent this by invoking <i>mailx</i> like
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>MAILRC=/dev/null mailx -n</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
You then need to create a configuration for <i>mailx</i> for your script. This
  can be done by either pointing the <i>MAILRC</i> variable to a custom
  configuration file, or by passing the configuration in environment variables.
  Since many of the configuration options are not valid shell variables, the
  <i>env</i> command is useful in this situation. An invocation could thus look
  like
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>env MAILRC=/dev/null</b> from=<i>scriptreply@domain</i> smtp=<i>host</i> \
          smtp-auth-user= <i>login</i> smtp-auth-password=<i>secret</i> \
          smtp-auth= <i>login</i> <b>mailx -n</b> -s &quot;<i>subject</i>&quot; \
          -a  <i>attachment_file</i> <i>recipient@domain</i> &lt;<i>content_file</i>
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="selflink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
fmt(1), newaliases(1), openssl(1), pg(1), more(1), vacation(1), ssl(3),
  aliases(5), locale(7), mailaddr(7), sendmail(8)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Variables in the environment passed to <i>mailx</i> cannot be unset.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The character set conversion relies on the <i>iconv</i>(3) function. Its
  functionality differs widely between the various system environments
  <i>mailx</i> runs on. If the message `Cannot convert from <i>a</i> to
  <i>b</i>' appears, either some characters within the message header or text
  are not appropriate for the currently selected terminal character set, or the
  needed conversion is not supported by the system. In the first case, it is
  necessary to set an appropriate LC_CTYPE locale (e.g. <i>en_US</i>) or the
  <i>ttycharset</i> variable. In the second case, the <i>sendcharsets</i> and
  <i>ttycharset</i> variables must be set to the same value to inhibit character
  set conversion. If <i>iconv()</i> is not available at all, the value assigned
  to <i>sendcharsets</i> must match the character set that is used on the
  terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mailx expects input text to be in Unix format, with lines separated by
  <i>newline</i> (^J, \n) characters only. Non-Unix text files that use
  <i>carriage return</i> (^M, \r) characters in addition will be treated as
  binary data; to send such files as text, strip these characters e.&#x00A0;g.
  by
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
tr -d '\015' &lt;input | mailx .&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
or fix the tools that generate them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Limitations with IMAP mailboxes are: It is not possible to edit messages, but it
  is possible to append them. Thus to edit a message, create a local copy of it,
  edit it, append it, and delete the original. The line count for the header
  display is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded from the
  server. The marking of messages as `new' is performed by the IMAP server; use
  of the <i>exit</i> command instead of <i>quit</i> will not cause it to be
  reset, and if the <i>autoinc</i>/<i>newmail</i> variables are unset, messages
  that arrived during a session will not be in state `new' anymore when the
  folder is opened again. Also if commands queued in disconnected mode are
  committed, the IMAP server will delete the `new' flag for all messages in the
  changed folder, and new messages will appear as unread when it is selected for
  viewing later. The `flagged', `answered', and `draft' attributes are usually
  permanent, but some IMAP servers are known to drop them without notification.
  Message numbers may change with IMAP every time before the prompt is printed
  if <i>mailx</i> is notified by the server that messages have been deleted by
  some other client or process. In this case, `Expunged <i>n</i> messages' is
  printed, and message numbers may have changed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Limitations with POP3 mailboxes are: It is not possible to edit messages, they
  can only be copied and deleted. The line count for the header display is only
  appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded from the server. The
  status field of a message is maintained by the server between connections;
  some servers do not update it at all, and with a server that does, the `exit'
  command will not cause the message status to be reset. The `newmail' command
  and the `newmail' variable have no effect. It is not possible to rename or to
  remove POP3 mailboxes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <small>RUBOUT</small> (interrupt) is typed while an IMAP or POP3 operation
  is in progress, <i>mailx</i> will wait until the operation can be safely
  aborted, and will then return to the command loop and print the prompt again.
  When a second <i>RUBOUT</i> is typed while <i>mailx</i> is waiting for the
  operation to complete, the operation itself will be canceled. In this case,
  data that has not been fetched yet will have to be fetched before the next
  command can be performed. If the canceled operation was using an SSL/TLS
  encrypted channel, an error in the SSL transport will very likely result, and
  the connection is no longer usable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As <i>mailx</i> is a mail user agent, it provides only basic SMTP services. If
  it fails to contact its upstream SMTP server, it will not make further
  attempts to transfer the message at a later time, and it does not leave other
  information about this condition than an error message on the terminal and a
  `dead.letter' file. This is usually not a problem if the SMTP server is
  located in the same local network as the computer on which <i>mailx</i> is
  run. However, care should be taken when using a remote server of an ISP; it
  might be better to set up a local SMTP server then which just acts as a proxy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Mailx</i> immediately contacts the SMTP server (or <i>/usr/lib/sendmail</i>)
  even when operating in <i>disconnected</i> mode. It would not make much sense
  for <i>mailx</i> to defer outgoing mail since SMTP servers usually provide
  much more elaborated delay handling than <i>mailx</i> could perform as a
  client. Thus the recommended setup for sending mail in <i>disconnected</i>
  mode is to configure a local SMTP server such that it sends outgoing mail as
  soon as an external network connection is available again, i.e. to advise it
  to do that from a network startup script.
