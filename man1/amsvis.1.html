locally or remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program helps visualize operating system data as it
relates to running within an Active Memory Sharing (AMS)
environment. The tool can be run both locally or remotely.
<br>
Additionally, it can be run as a local data server, without
a graphical user interface (GUI), to provide data for
running the GUI remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the GUI is run for a single
host a number of panels will be displayed for the operating
system, these are the System, IO Bus Memory, and IO Devices
panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the GUI is run for multiple
hosts only the System Panel will be displayed for each of
the hosts. This is achieved by specifying multiple systems
on the command-line via the <br>
--hosts option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System Panel <br>
In an AMS environment, the amount of memory available will
change as memory is loaned to other partitions by the
Cooperative Memory Manager (CMM) module. This panel will
show <br>
how the total amount of memory provided to the system is
being utilized. The graph displays a histogram showing the
loaned, used, and free memory; the most recent value is
dis&acirc; <br>
played to the right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the system memory panel
there are six values displays beneath the graph, they
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Total This value, expressed in
kilobytes, is the maximum amount of memory available to the
operating system. This value represents the graph&rsquo;s
total height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loaned This is the amount of
memory, in kilobytes, that the operating system has
temporarily given back to the platform firmware to be used
by other partitions. This value fluc&acirc; <br>
tuates to meet the demands of all of the partitions in the
shared memory pool of an AMS environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used This value, displayed in
kilobytes, is the amount of system memory in-use, not
including buffers or cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Free This value, displayed in
kilobytes, is the amount of system memory which is
unused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Faults A fault occurs when an
attempt to access memory is made where the platform firmware
must suspend the partition and request data from disk. This
value is a sum of the num&acirc; <br>
ber of faults since the system was booted. Increases in this
value indicate contention for memory between partitions in
the AMS environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fault time <br>
This value is a running sum of the amount of time, since
boot time, that the operating system has been suspended by
platform firmware to process faults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO Bus Memory Panel <br>
This panel shows how the memory given to the operating
system for IO operations is being used by the bus and the
devices present on the bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graph will display a
histogram for the spare and in use memory with the most
recent value on the right side of the graph. The graph is
overlayed with a dashed line corre&acirc; <br>
sponding in color to the high water value and another dashed
line for the reserve pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the system&rsquo;s IO bus
memory panel there are eight values displayed beneath the
graph, they are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entitled <br>
The entitled memory is a specific amount of memory given to
the operating system that will be available to be mapped for
IO operations; this guarantee is maintained by the <br>
platform firmware and can be tuned through the HMC or IVM
depending on the particular environment. This value is
displayed in kilobytes. The amount of entitled memory is
<br>
changed by the HMC or IVM in response to hot-plug events or
explicit tuning. This value represents the graph&rsquo;s
total height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Desired <br>
Each device in the system that requires memory for mapping
IO operations will specify an amount of memory which is
desired for optimal performance. This value is the sum <br>
of the requests made by individual devices on the bus and is
measured in kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">High water <br>
This value, measured in kilobytes, represents the largest
amount of memory mapped at any one point in time since the
system was booted or the field was last reset. This <br>
value can be reset by writing a &rsquo;0&rsquo; to the file
/sys/bus/vio/cmo_high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In use This value represents the
amount of memory, in kilobytes, that is currently mapped by
device drivers for IO operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spare This value represents the
amount of memory, in kilobytes, kept unused to handle
hot-plug events, entitlement rebalancing between devices,
and module loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reserve pool <br>
The entitled memory is split into two pools, the first of
which is the reserve pool. This value, expressed in
kilobytes, represents the amount of memory guaranteed to
<br>
individual devices on the bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excess pool <br>
This pool contains any amount of entitled memory not placed
in the reserve pool; the value is displayed in kilobytes.
Any device can map memory from this pool for IO <br>
operations, after having used up its own allocation from the
reserve pool, until the excess pool is exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excess free <br>
This value represents the amount of memory, in kilobytes,
currently available for devices to use from the excess
pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO Devices Panel <br>
There will be one panel for each VIO device present in the
system that maps memory for IO operations. Panels will be
added and removed for devices as a result of DLPAR hot-plug
<br>
operations and module load/unload events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graph will display a
histogram for the values of allocated memory, with the most
recent value on the right side of the graph. The graph is
overlaid with a dashed line that <br>
represents the latest value of entitled memory. The area of
the graph above the dashed line represents the excess Pool
of IO bus memory, any portion of this area that is grayed
<br>
out has been mapped by other devices and is currently
unavailable to the particular device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each device panel there are
five values displayed beneath the graph, they are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device Name <br>
The name displayed for the device is its location on the
bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entitled <br>
The amount of memory, in kilobytes, that the device is
guaranteed that it may map for IO operations. The bus will
guarantee that the device can map this number of kilo&acirc;
<br>
bytes of memory for IO operations. The allocation of this
entitled memory is made to the device from the bus&rsquo;
reserve pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Desired <br>
The amount of memory, in kilobytes, that the device has
requested from the bus to provide optimal performance. The
amount of entitled memory will not exceed this amount. <br>
The device may receive a memory entitlement less than its
desired level in cases where resources are limited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocated <br>
The amount of memory, in kilobytes, that the device has
currently mapped for IO operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocs failed <br>
When the amount of memory allocated has exhausted both the
entitled memory and the bus&rsquo; excess pool, memory
mapping failures will occur. For each failed attempt, the
<br>
value displayed here will increase by 1. Large changes in
this value would indicate resource contention that may
require system tuning. The device drivers are written <br>
such that these failures, while impacting performance, do
not impede functionality. To reset this counter, the value
&rsquo;0&rsquo; can be written to the file <br>
/sys/bus/vio/devices/&lt;device
name&gt;/cmo_allocs_failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Though not a bug, the name of a number of files and
variables are of the form cmo* rather than Active Memory
Sharing (AMS). The kernel code for this feature was
committed under <br>
the name Cooperative Memory Overcommitment (CMO). Kernel
support is enabled using the kernel config option
CONFIG_PPC_SMLPAR, for shared memory logical partition
support.</p>
