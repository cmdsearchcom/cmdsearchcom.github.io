<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlxstypemap - Perl XS C/Perl type mapping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The more you think about interfacing between two languages,
the more you&rsquo;ll realize that the majority of
programmer effort has to go into converting between the data
structures <br>
that are native to either of the languages involved. This
trumps other matter such as differing calling conventions
because the problem space is so much greater. There are <br>
simply more ways to shove data into memory than there are
ways to implement a function call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl XS&rsquo; attempt at a
solution to this is the concept of typemaps. At an abstract
level, a Perl XS typemap is nothing but a recipe for
converting from a certain Perl data <br>
structure to a certain C data structure and vice versa.
Since there can be C types that are sufficiently similar to
warrant converting with the same logic, XS typemaps are <br>
represented by a unique identifier, henceforth called an
&lt;XS type&gt; in this document. You can then tell the XS
compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the
same XS <br>
typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In your XS code, when you define
an argument with a C type or when you are using a
&quot;CODE:&quot; and an &quot;OUTPUT:&quot; section
together with a C return type of your XSUB, it&rsquo;ll be
the <br>
typemapping mechanism that makes this easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anatomy of a typemap <br>
In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the xsubpp compiler to map C
function parameters and values to Perl values. The typemap
<br>
file may consist of three sections labelled
&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;, &quot;INPUT&quot;, and
&quot;OUTPUT&quot;. An unlabelled initial section is assumed
to be a &quot;TYPEMAP&quot; section. The INPUT section tells
the <br>
compiler how to translate Perl values into variables of
certain C types. The OUTPUT section tells the compiler how
to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl <br>
can understand. The TYPEMAP section tells the compiler which
of the INPUT and OUTPUT code fragments should be used to map
a given C type to a Perl value. The section labels <br>
&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;, &quot;INPUT&quot;, or
&quot;OUTPUT&quot; must begin in the first column on a line
by themselves, and must be in uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each type of section can appear
an arbitrary number of times and does not have to appear at
all. For example, a typemap may commonly lack
&quot;INPUT&quot; and &quot;OUTPUT&quot; sections if all it
<br>
needs to do is associate additional C types with core XS
types like T_PTROBJ. Lines that start with a hash
&quot;#&quot; are considered comments and ignored in the
&quot;TYPEMAP&quot; section, but <br>
are considered significant in &quot;INPUT&quot; and
&quot;OUTPUT&quot;. Blank lines are generally ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traditionally, typemaps needed
to be written to a separate file, conventionally called
&quot;typemap&quot; in a CPAN distribution. With
ExtUtils::ParseXS (the XS compiler) version 3.12 or <br>
better which comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be
embedded directly into XS code using a HERE-doc like
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP: &lt;&lt;HERE <br>
... <br>
HERE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &quot;HERE&quot; can be
replaced by other identifiers like with normal Perl
HERE-docs. All details below about the typemap textual
format remain valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;TYPEMAP&quot; section
should contain one pair of C type and XS type per line as
follows. An example from the core typemap file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP <br>
# all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap <br>
char * T_PV <br>
const char * T_PV <br>
unsigned char * T_PV <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;INPUT&quot; and
&quot;OUTPUT&quot; sections have identical formats, that is,
each unindented line starts a new in- or output map
respectively. A new in- or output map must start with the
<br>
name of the XS type to map on a line by itself, followed by
the code that implements it indented on the following lines.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br>
T_PV <br>
$var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg) <br>
T_PTR <br>
$var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll get to the meaning
of those Perlish-looking variables in a little bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, here&rsquo;s an example
of the full typemap file for mapping C strings of the
&quot;char *&quot; type to Perl scalars/strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP <br>
char * T_PV</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br>
T_PV <br>
$var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
T_PV <br>
sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a more complicated
example: suppose that you wanted &quot;struct
netconfig&quot; to be blessed into the class
&quot;Net::Config&quot;. One way to do this is to use
underscores (_) to <br>
separate package names, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef struct netconfig *
Net_Config;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And then provide a typemap entry
&quot;T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL&quot; that maps underscores to
double-colons (::), and declare &quot;Net_Config&quot; to be
of that type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP <br>
Net_Config T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br>
T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL <br>
if (sv_derived_from($arg, <br>
IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg)); <br>
$var = INT2PTR($type, tmp); <br>
} <br>
else <br>
croak(</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL <br>
sv_setref_pv($arg, <br>
(void*)$var);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The INPUT and OUTPUT sections
substitute underscores for double-colons on the fly, giving
the desired effect. This example demonstrates some of the
power and versatility of the <br>
typemap facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;INT2PTR&quot; macro
(defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer of a given
type, taking care of the possible different size of integers
and pointers. There are also <br>
&quot;PTR2IV&quot;, &quot;PTR2UV&quot;, &quot;PTR2NV&quot;
macros, to map the other way, which may be useful in OUTPUT
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Role of the typemap File in
Your Distribution <br>
The default typemap in the lib/ExtUtils directory of the
Perl source contains many useful types which can be used by
Perl extensions. Some extensions define additional typemaps
<br>
which they keep in their own directory. These additional
typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main
typemap. The xsubpp compiler will allow the
extension&rsquo;s own <br>
typemap to override any mappings which are in the default
typemap. Instead of using an additional typemap file,
typemaps may be embedded verbatim in XS with a heredoc-like
<br>
syntax. See the documentation on the &quot;TYPEMAP:&quot; XS
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For CPAN distributions, you can
assume that the XS types defined by the perl core are
already available. Additionally, the core typemap has
default XS types for a large number of <br>
C types. For example, if you simply return a &quot;char
*&quot; from your XSUB, the core typemap will have this C
type associated with the T_PV XS type. That means your C
string will be <br>
copied into the PV (pointer value) slot of a new scalar that
will be returned from your XSUB to to Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re developing a
CPAN distribution using XS, you may add your own file called
typemap to the distribution. That file may contain typemaps
that either map types that are <br>
specific to your code or that override the core typemap
file&rsquo;s mappings for common C types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sharing typemaps Between CPAN
Distributions <br>
Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with
perl 5.16 and better), it is rather easy to share typemap
code between multiple CPAN distributions. The general idea
<br>
is to share it as a module that offers a certain API and
have the dependent modules declare that as a built-time
requirement and import the typemap into the XS. An example
of <br>
such a typemap-sharing module on CPAN is
&quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot;. Two steps to getting
that module&rsquo;s typemaps available in your code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Declare
&quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot; as a build-time
dependency in &quot;Makefile.PL&quot; (use
&quot;BUILD_REQUIRES&quot;), or in your &quot;Build.PL&quot;
(use &quot;build_requires&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Include the
following line in the XS section of your XS file:
(don&rsquo;t break the line)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X
-MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd <br>
-e &quot;print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing typemap Entries <br>
Each INPUT or OUTPUT typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl
string that will be evaluated in the presence of certain
variables to get the final C code for mapping a certain C
<br>
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you can embed
Perl code in your typemap (C) code using constructs such as
&quot;${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here
}&quot;. A common use case is to <br>
generate error messages that refer to the true function name
even when using the ALIAS XS feature:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${ $ALIAS ? q[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))]
: qq[</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For many typemap examples, refer
to the core typemap file that can be found in the perl
source tree at lib/ExtUtils/typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl variables that are
available for interpolation into typemaps are the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $var - the name
of the input or output variable, eg. RETVAL for return
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $type - the raw
C type of the parameter, any &quot;:&quot; replaced with
&quot;_&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $ntype - the
supplied type with &quot;*&quot; replaced with
&quot;Ptr&quot;. e.g. for a type of &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;,
$ntype is &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $arg - the stack
entry, that the parameter is input from or output to, e.g.
ST(0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $argoff - the
argument stack offset of the argument. ie. 0 for the first
argument, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $pname - the
full name of the XSUB, with including the
&quot;PACKAGE&quot; name, with any &quot;PREFIX&quot;
stripped. This is the non-ALIAS name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $Package - the
package specified by the most recent &quot;PACKAGE&quot;
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $ALIAS -
non-zero if the current XSUB has any aliases declared with
&quot;ALIAS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full Listing of Core Typemaps
<br>
Each C type is represented by an entry in the typemap file
that is responsible for converting perl variables (SV, AV,
HV, CV, etc.) to and from that type. The following sections
<br>
list all XS types that come with perl by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_SV <br>
This simply passes the C representation of the Perl variable
(an SV*) in and out of the XS layer. This can be used if the
C code wants to deal directly with the Perl <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_SVREF <br>
Used to pass in and return a reference to an SV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this typemap does not
decrement the reference count when returning the reference
to an SV*. See also: T_SVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_SVREF_FIXED <br>
Used to pass in and return a reference to an SV. This is a
fixed variant of T_SVREF that decrements the refcount
appropriately when returning a reference to an SV*. <br>
Introduced in perl 5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_AVREF <br>
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an AV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this typemap does not
decrement the reference count when returning an AV*. See
also: T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED <br>
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl array.
From the C level this is a pointer to an AV. This is a fixed
variant of T_AVREF that decrements the refcount <br>
appropriately when returning an AV*. Introduced in perl
5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_HVREF <br>
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash. From
the C level this is a pointer to an HV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this typemap does not
decrement the reference count when returning an HV*. See
also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED <br>
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl hash. From
the C level this is a pointer to an HV. This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount <br>
appropriately when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl
5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_CVREF <br>
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. $sub = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a CV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this typemap does not
decrement the reference count when returning an HV*. See
also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED <br>
From the perl level this is a reference to a perl subroutine
(e.g. $sub = sub { 1 };). From the C level this is a pointer
to a CV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a fixed variant of
T_HVREF that decrements the refcount appropriately when
returning an HV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_SYSRET <br>
The T_SYSRET typemap is used to process return values from
system calls. It is only meaningful when passing values from
C to perl (there is no concept of passing a system <br>
return value from Perl to C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System calls return -1 on error
(setting ERRNO with the reason) and (usually) 0 on success.
If the return value is -1 this typemap returns
&quot;undef&quot;. If the return value is not <br>
-1, this typemap translates a 0 (perl false) to &quot;0 but
true&quot; (which is perl true) or returns the value itself,
to indicate that the command succeeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The POSIX module makes extensive
use of this type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_UV <br>
An unsigned integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_IV <br>
A signed integer. This is cast to the required integer type
when passed to C and converted to an IV when passed back to
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_INT <br>
A signed integer. This typemap converts the Perl value to a
native integer type (the &quot;int&quot; type on the current
platform). When returning the value to perl it is processed
in <br>
the same way as for T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Its behaviour is identical to
using an &quot;int&quot; type in XS with T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_ENUM <br>
An enum value. Used to transfer an enum component from C.
There is no reason to pass an enum value to C since it is
stored as an IV inside perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_BOOL <br>
A boolean type. This can be used to pass true and false
values to and from C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_U_INT <br>
This is for unsigned integers. It is equivalent to using
T_UV but explicitly casts the variable to type
&quot;unsigned int&quot;. The default type for
&quot;unsigned int&quot; is T_UV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_SHORT <br>
Short integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly
casts the return to type &quot;short&quot;. The default
typemap for &quot;short&quot; is T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_U_SHORT <br>
Unsigned short integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but
explicitly casts the return to type &quot;unsigned
short&quot;. The default typemap for &quot;unsigned
short&quot; is T_UV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_U_SHORT is used for type
&quot;U16&quot; in the standard typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_LONG <br>
Long integers. This is equivalent to T_IV but explicitly
casts the return to type &quot;long&quot;. The default
typemap for &quot;long&quot; is T_IV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_U_LONG <br>
Unsigned long integers. This is equivalent to T_UV but
explicitly casts the return to type &quot;unsigned
long&quot;. The default typemap for &quot;unsigned
long&quot; is T_UV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_U_LONG is used for type
&quot;U32&quot; in the standard typemap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_CHAR <br>
Single 8-bit characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_U_CHAR <br>
An unsigned byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_FLOAT <br>
A floating point number. This typemap guarantees to return a
variable cast to a &quot;float&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_NV <br>
A Perl floating point number. Similar to T_IV and T_UV in
that the return type is cast to the requested numeric type
rather than to a specific type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_DOUBLE <br>
A double precision floating point number. This typemap
guarantees to return a variable cast to a
&quot;double&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PV <br>
A string (char *).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PTR <br>
A memory address (pointer). Typically associated with a
&quot;void *&quot; type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PTRREF <br>
Similar to T_PTR except that the pointer is stored in a
scalar and the reference to that scalar is returned to the
caller. This can be used to hide the actual pointer value
<br>
from the programmer since it is usually not required
directly from within perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The typemap checks that a scalar
reference is passed from perl to XS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PTROBJ <br>
Similar to T_PTRREF except that the reference is blessed
into a class. This allows the pointer to be used as an
object. Most commonly used to deal with C structs. The <br>
typemap checks that the perl object passed into the XS
routine is of the correct class (or part of a subclass).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pointer is blessed into a
class that is derived from the name of type of the pointer
but with all &rsquo;*&rsquo; in the name replaced with
&rsquo;Ptr&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_REF_IV_REF <br>
NOT YET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_REF_IV_PTR <br>
Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the pointer is blessed into a
scalar object. The difference is that when the object is
passed back into XS it must be of the correct type <br>
(inheritance is not supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pointer is blessed into a
class that is derived from the name of type of the pointer
but with all &rsquo;*&rsquo; in the name replaced with
&rsquo;Ptr&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PTRDESC <br>
NOT YET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_REFREF <br>
Similar to T_PTRREF, except the pointer stored in the
referenced scalar is dereferenced and copied to the output
variable. This means that T_REFREF is to T_PTRREF as
T_OPAQUE <br>
is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the INPUT part of this is
implemented (Perl to XSUB) and there are no known users in
core or on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_REFOBJ <br>
NOT YET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_OPAQUEPTR <br>
This can be used to store bytes in the string component of
the SV. Here the representation of the data is irrelevant to
perl and the bytes themselves are just stored in the <br>
SV. It is assumed that the C variable is a pointer (the
bytes are copied from that memory location). If the pointer
is pointing to something that is represented by 8 bytes <br>
then those 8 bytes are stored in the SV (and length() will
report a value of 8). This entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In principle the unpack()
command can be used to convert the bytes back to a number
(if the underlying type is known to be a number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This entry can be used to store
a C structure (the number of bytes to be copied is
calculated using the C &quot;sizeof&quot; function) and can
be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF <br>
without having to worry about a memory leak (since Perl will
clean up the SV).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_OPAQUE <br>
This can be used to store data from non-pointer types in the
string part of an SV. It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except
that the typemap retrieves the pointer directly rather <br>
than assuming it is being supplied. For example, if an
integer is imported into Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than
T_IV the underlying bytes representing the integer will be
<br>
stored in the SV but the actual integer value will not be
available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data may be retrieved using
the &quot;unpack&quot; function if the underlying type of
the byte stream is known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_OPAQUE supports input and
output of simple types. T_OPAQUEPTR can be used to pass
these bytes back into C if a pointer is acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicit array <br>
xsubpp supports a special syntax for returning packed C
arrays to perl. If the XS return type is given as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array(type, nelem)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xsubpp will copy the contents of
&quot;nelem * sizeof(type)&quot; bytes from RETVAL to an SV
and push it onto the stack. This is only really useful if
the number of items to be <br>
returned is known at compile time and you don&rsquo;t mind
having a string of bytes in your SV. Use T_ARRAY to push a
variable number of arguments onto the return stack (they
<br>
won&rsquo;t be packed as a single string though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is similar to using
T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more than one
element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PACKED <br>
Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For
&quot;OUTPUT&quot; (XSUB to Perl), a function named
&quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot; is called with the output Perl
scalar and the C variable to <br>
convert from. $ntype is the normalized C type that is to be
mapped to Perl. Normalized means that all &quot;*&quot; are
replaced by the string &quot;Ptr&quot;. The return value of
the function <br>
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversely for &quot;INPUT&quot;
(Perl to XSUB) mapping, the function named
&quot;XS_unpack_$ntype&quot; is called with the input Perl
scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the <br>
mapped C type and assigned to the output C variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example conversion function
for a typemapped struct &quot;foo_t *&quot; might be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static void <br>
XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in) <br>
{ <br>
dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */ <br>
HV* hash = newHV(); <br>
hv_stores(hash, &quot;int_member&quot;,
newSViv(in-&gt;int_member)); <br>
hv_stores(hash, &quot;float_member&quot;,

/* ... */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conversion from Perl to C is
left as an exercise to the reader, but the prototype would
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static foo_t * <br>
XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of an actual C function
that has to fetch the thread context using &quot;dTHX&quot;,
you can define macros of the same name and avoid the
overhead. Also, keep in mind to <br>
possibly free the memory allocated by
&quot;XS_unpack_foo_tPtr&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_PACKEDARRAY <br>
T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to T_PACKED. In fact, the
&quot;INPUT&quot; (Perl to XSUB) typemap is indentical, but
the &quot;OUTPUT&quot; typemap passes an additional argument
to the <br>
&quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot; function. This third parameter
indicates the number of elements in the output so that the
function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable needs to
be <br>
declared by the user and must have the name
&quot;count_$ntype&quot; where $ntype is the normalized C
type name as explained above. The signature of the function
would be for the <br>
example above and &quot;foo_t **&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static void <br>
XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV
count_foo_tPtrPtr);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of the third parameter
is arbitrary as far as the typemap is concerned. It just has
to be in line with the declared variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, unless you know the
number of elements in the &quot;sometype **&quot; C array,
within your XSUB, the return value from &quot;foo_t **
XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)&quot; will be hard to <br>
decypher. Since the details are all up to the XS author (the
typemap user), there are several solutions, none of which
particularly elegant. The most commonly seen solution <br>
has been to allocate memory for N+1 pointers and assign
&quot;NULL&quot; to the (N+1)th to facilitate iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, using a
customized typemap for your purposes in the first place is
probably preferrable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_ARRAY <br>
This is used to convert the perl argument list to a C array
and for pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl
argument stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual calling signature
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@out = array_func( @in );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any number of arguments can
occur in the list before the array but the input and output
arrays must be the last elements in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used to pass a perl list to
C the XS writer must provide a function (named after the
array type but with &rsquo;Ptr&rsquo; substituted for
&rsquo;*&rsquo;) to allocate the memory required to <br>
hold the list. A pointer should be returned. It is up to the
XS writer to free the memory on exit from the function. The
variable &quot;ix_$var&quot; is set to the number of
elements <br>
in the new array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When returning a C array to Perl
the XS writer must provide an integer variable called
&quot;size_$var&quot; containing the number of elements in
the array. This is used to determine <br>
how many elements should be pushed onto the return argument
stack. This is not required on input since Perl knows how
many arguments are on the stack when the routine is <br>
called. Ordinarily this variable would be called
&quot;size_RETVAL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the type of each
element is determined from the type of the array. If the
array uses type &quot;intArray *&quot; xsubpp will
automatically work out that it contains <br>
variables of type &quot;int&quot; and use that typemap entry
to perform the copy of each element. All pointer
&rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;Array&rsquo; tags are removed
from the name to determine the subtype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_STDIO <br>
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C
using &quot;FILE *&quot; structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_INOUT <br>
This is used for passing perl filehandles to and from C
using &quot;PerlIO *&quot; structures. The file handle can
used for reading and writing. This corresponds to the
&quot;+&lt;&quot; mode, see <br>
also T_IN and T_OUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perliol for more information
on the Perl IO abstraction layer. Perl must have been built
with &quot;-Duseperlio&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no check to assert that
the filehandle passed from Perl to C was created with the
right &quot;open()&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: The perlxstut tutorial
covers the T_INOUT, T_IN, and T_OUT XS types nicely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_IN <br>
Same as T_INOUT, but the filehandle that is returned from C
to Perl can only be used for reading (mode
&quot;&lt;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T_OUT <br>
Same as T_INOUT, but the filehandle that is returned from C
to Perl is set to use the open mode &quot;+&gt;&quot;.</p>
