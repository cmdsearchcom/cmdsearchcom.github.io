perlxstypemap - Perl XS C/Perl type mapping
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The more you think about interfacing between two languages, the more you'll
  realize that the majority of programmer effort has to go into converting
  between the data structures that are native to either of the languages
  involved. This trumps other matter such as differing calling conventions
  because the problem space is so much greater. There are simply more ways to
  shove data into memory than there are ways to implement a function call.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl XS' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps. At an
  abstract level, a Perl XS typemap is nothing but a recipe for converting from
  a certain Perl data structure to a certain C data structure and vice versa.
  Since there can be C types that are sufficiently similar to warrant converting
  with the same logic, XS typemaps are represented by a unique identifier,
  henceforth called an &lt;XS type&gt; in this document. You can then tell the
  XS compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the same XS typemap.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In your XS code, when you define an argument with a C type or when you are using
  a &quot;CODE:&quot; and an &quot;OUTPUT:&quot; section together with a C
  return type of your XSUB, it'll be the typemapping mechanism that makes this
  easy.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Anatomy_of_a_typemap"><a class="selflink" href="#Anatomy_of_a_typemap">Anatomy
  of a typemap</a></h2>
In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code fragments which are
  used by the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler to map C function parameters and values to
  Perl values. The typemap file may consist of three sections labelled
  &quot;TYPEMAP&quot;, &quot;INPUT&quot;, and &quot;OUTPUT&quot;. An unlabelled
  initial section is assumed to be a &quot;TYPEMAP&quot; section. The INPUT
  section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values into variables of
  certain C types. The OUTPUT section tells the compiler how to translate the
  values from certain C types into values Perl can understand. The TYPEMAP
  section tells the compiler which of the INPUT and OUTPUT code fragments should
  be used to map a given C type to a Perl value. The section labels
  &quot;TYPEMAP&quot;, &quot;INPUT&quot;, or &quot;OUTPUT&quot; must begin in
  the first column on a line by themselves, and must be in uppercase.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each type of section can appear an arbitrary number of times and does not have
  to appear at all. For example, a typemap may commonly lack &quot;INPUT&quot;
  and &quot;OUTPUT&quot; sections if all it needs to do is associate additional
  C types with core XS types like T_PTROBJ. Lines that start with a hash
  &quot;#&quot; are considered comments and ignored in the &quot;TYPEMAP&quot;
  section, but are considered significant in &quot;INPUT&quot; and
  &quot;OUTPUT&quot;. Blank lines are generally ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Traditionally, typemaps needed to be written to a separate file, conventionally
  called &quot;typemap&quot; in a CPAN distribution. With ExtUtils::ParseXS (the
  XS compiler) version 3.12 or better which comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can
  also be embedded directly into XS code using a HERE-doc like syntax:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP: &lt;&lt;HERE
  ...
  HERE
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where &quot;HERE&quot; can be replaced by other identifiers like with normal
  Perl HERE-docs. All details below about the typemap textual format remain
  valid.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;TYPEMAP&quot; section should contain one pair of C type and XS type
  per line as follows. An example from the core typemap file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP
  # all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
  char *          T_PV
  const char *    T_PV
  unsigned char * T_PV
  ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;INPUT&quot; and &quot;OUTPUT&quot; sections have identical formats,
  that is, each unindented line starts a new in- or output map respectively. A
  new in- or output map must start with the name of the XS type to map on a line
  by itself, followed by the code that implements it indented on the following
  lines. Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  INPUT
  T_PV
    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
  T_PTR
    $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We'll get to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a little bit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, here's an example of the full typemap file for mapping C strings of the
  &quot;char *&quot; type to Perl scalars/strings:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP
  char *  T_PV
  
  INPUT
  T_PV
    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
  
  OUTPUT
  T_PV
    sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted &quot;struct
  netconfig&quot; to be blessed into the class &quot;Net::Config&quot;. One way
  to do this is to use underscores (_) to separate package names, as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And then provide a typemap entry &quot;T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL&quot; that maps
  underscores to double-colons (::), and declare &quot;Net_Config&quot; to be of
  that type:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP
  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
  
  INPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)){
      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
    }
    else
      croak(\&quot;$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)
  
  OUTPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    sv_setref_pv($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;,
                 (void*)$var);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The INPUT and OUTPUT sections substitute underscores for double-colons on the
  fly, giving the desired effect. This example demonstrates some of the power
  and versatility of the typemap facility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;INT2PTR&quot; macro (defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer
  of a given type, taking care of the possible different size of integers and
  pointers. There are also &quot;PTR2IV&quot;, &quot;PTR2UV&quot;,
  &quot;PTR2NV&quot; macros, to map the other way, which may be useful in OUTPUT
  sections.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Role_of_the_typemap_File_in_Your_Distribution"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Role_of_the_typemap_File_in_Your_Distribution">The
  Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution</a></h2>
The default typemap in the <i>lib/ExtUtils</i> directory of the Perl source
  contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions. Some
  extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.
  These additional typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main
  typemap. The <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
  override any mappings which are in the default typemap. Instead of using an
  additional <i>typemap</i> file, typemaps may be embedded verbatim in XS with a
  heredoc-like syntax. See the documentation on the &quot;TYPEMAP:&quot; XS
  keyword.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For CPAN distributions, you can assume that the XS types defined by the perl
  core are already available. Additionally, the core typemap has default XS
  types for a large number of C types. For example, if you simply return a
  &quot;char *&quot; from your XSUB, the core typemap will have this C type
  associated with the T_PV XS type. That means your C string will be copied into
  the PV (pointer value) slot of a new scalar that will be returned from your
  XSUB to to Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're developing a CPAN distribution using XS, you may add your own file
  called <i>typemap</i> to the distribution. That file may contain typemaps that
  either map types that are specific to your code or that override the core
  typemap file's mappings for common C types.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sharing_typemaps_Between_CPAN_Distributions"><a class="selflink" href="#Sharing_typemaps_Between_CPAN_Distributions">Sharing
  typemaps Between CPAN Distributions</a></h2>
Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16 and
  better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple CPAN
  distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that offers a
  certain API and have the dependent modules declare that as a built-time
  requirement and import the typemap into the XS. An example of such a
  typemap-sharing module on CPAN is &quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot;. Two
  steps to getting that module's typemaps available in your code:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Declare &quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot; as a
      build-time dependency in &quot;Makefile.PL&quot; (use
      &quot;BUILD_REQUIRES&quot;), or in your &quot;Build.PL&quot; (use
      &quot;build_requires&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Include the following line in the XS section of your XS
      file: (don't break the line)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X -MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd
                   -e &quot;print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})&quot;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Writing_typemap_Entries"><a class="selflink" href="#Writing_typemap_Entries">Writing
  typemap Entries</a></h2>
Each INPUT or OUTPUT typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl string that will be
  evaluated in the presence of certain variables to get the final C code for
  mapping a certain C type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
  constructs such as &quot;${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here
  }&quot;. A common use case is to generate error messages that refer to the
  true function name even when using the ALIAS XS feature:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ${ $ALIAS ? \q[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \qq[\&quot;$pname\&quot;] }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For many typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be found in
  the perl source tree at <i>lib/ExtUtils/typemap</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps are the
  following:

      the pointer is pointing to something that is represented by 8 bytes then
      those 8 bytes are stored in the SV (and <i>length()</i> will report a

      rather than T_IV the underlying bytes representing the integer will be
      stored in the SV but the actual integer value will not be available. i.e.
      The data is opaque to perl.

  array(type, nelem)

    xsubpp will copy the contents of &quot;nelem * sizeof(type)&quot; bytes from

      the number of items to be returned is known at compile time and you don't
      mind having a string of bytes in your SV. Use T_ARRAY to push a variable
      number of arguments onto the return stack (they won't be packed as a

  <dd class="It-tag">Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For
      &quot;OUTPUT&quot; (XSUB to Perl), a function named
      &quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot; is called with the output Perl scalar and the C
      variable to convert from. $ntype is the normalized C type that is to be
      mapped to Perl. Normalized means that all &quot;*&quot; are replaced by
      the string &quot;Ptr&quot;. The return value of the function is ignored.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Conversely for &quot;INPUT&quot; (Perl to XSUB) mapping, the function named
      &quot;XS_unpack_$ntype&quot; is called with the input Perl scalar as
      argument and the return value is cast to the mapped C type and assigned to
      the output C variable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An example conversion function for a typemapped struct &quot;foo_t *&quot;
      might be:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  static void
  XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in)
  {

    HV* hash = newHV();
    hv_stores(hash, &quot;int_member&quot;, newSViv(in-&gt;int_member));
    hv_stores(hash, &quot;float_member&quot;, newSVnv(in-&gt;float_member));
    /* ... */
    /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
    sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));
  }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The conversion from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the reader, but the
      prototype would be:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  static foo_t *
  XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Instead of an actual C function that has to fetch the thread context using
      &quot;dTHX&quot;, you can define macros of the same name and avoid the
      overhead. Also, keep in mind to possibly free the memory allocated by
      &quot;XS_unpack_foo_tPtr&quot;.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">T_PACKEDARRAY</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to T_PACKED. In fact, the
      &quot;INPUT&quot; (Perl to XSUB) typemap is indentical, but the
      &quot;OUTPUT&quot; typemap passes an additional argument to the
      &quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot; function. This third parameter indicates the
      number of elements in the output so that the function can handle C arrays
      sanely. The variable needs to be declared by the user and must have the
      name &quot;count_$ntype&quot; where $ntype is the normalized C type name
      as explained above. The signature of the function would be for the example
      above and &quot;foo_t **&quot;:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  static void
  XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The type of the third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap is
      concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared variable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Of course, unless you know the number of elements in the &quot;sometype
      **&quot; C array, within your XSUB, the return value from &quot;foo_t **
      XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)&quot; will be hard to decypher. Since the
      details are all up to the XS author (the typemap user), there are several
      solutions, none of which particularly elegant. The most commonly seen
      solution has been to allocate memory for N+1 pointers and assign
      &quot;NULL&quot; to the (N+1)th to facilitate iteration.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Alternatively, using a customized typemap for your purposes in the first
      place is probably preferrable.</dd>

      and for pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl argument stack.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The usual calling signature is
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  @out = array_func( @in );
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Any number of arguments can occur in the list before the array but the input
      and output arrays must be the last elements in the list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When used to pass a perl list to C the XS writer must provide a function
      (named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for '*') to
      allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer should be
      returned. It is up to the XS writer to free the memory on exit from the
      function. The variable &quot;ix_$var&quot; is set to the number of
      elements in the new array.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When returning a C array to Perl the XS writer must provide an integer
      variable called &quot;size_$var&quot; containing the number of elements in
      the array. This is used to determine how many elements should be pushed
      onto the return argument stack. This is not required on input since Perl
      knows how many arguments are on the stack when the routine is called.
      Ordinarily this variable would be called &quot;size_RETVAL&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Additionally, the type of each element is determined from the type of the
      array. If the array uses type &quot;intArray *&quot; xsubpp will
      automatically work out that it contains variables of type &quot;int&quot;
      and use that typemap entry to perform the copy of each element. All
      pointer '*' and 'Array' tags are removed from the name to determine the
      subtype.</dd>
