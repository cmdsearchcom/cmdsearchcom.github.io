<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gmtspatial - Do geospatial operations on lines and
polygons</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

-D[+ffile][+aamax][+ddmax][+c|Ccmax][+sfact] ] [ -E+|- ] [

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gmtspatial reads one or more data files (which may be
multisegment files) that contains closed polygons and
operates of these polygons in the specified way. Operations
include <br>
area calculation, handedness reversals, and polygon
intersections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
table One or more ASCII (or binary, see -bi[ncols][type])
data table file(s) holding a number of data columns. If no
tables are given then we read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A[amin_dist][unit] <br>
Perform spatial nearest neighbor (NN) analysis: Determine
the nearest neighbor of each point and report the NN
distances and the point IDs involved in each pair (IDs are
<br>
the input record numbers starting at 0). Use -Aa to decimate
a data set so that no NN distance is lower than the
threshold min_dist. In this case we write out the
(pos&acirc; <br>
sibly averaged) coordinates and the updated NN distances and
point IDs. A negative point number means the original point
was replaced by a weighted average (the absolute <br>
ID value gives the ID of the first original point ID to be
included in the average.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Clips polygons to the map
region, including map boundary to the polygon as needed. The
result is a closed polygon (see -T for truncation instead).
Requires -R.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[+ffile][+aamax][+ddmax][+c|Ccmax][+sfact]
<br>
Check for duplicates among the input lines or polygons, or,
if file is given via +f, check if the input features already
exist among the features in file. We consider the <br>
cases of exact (same number and coordinates) and approximate
matches (average distance between nearest points of two
features is less than a threshold). We also consider <br>
that some features may have been reversed. Features are
considered approximate matches if their minimum distance is
less than dmax [0] (see UNITS) and their closeness <br>
(defined as the ratio between the average distance between
the features divided by their average length) is less than
cmax [0.01]. For each duplicate found, the output <br>
record begins with the single letter Y (exact match) or ~
(approximate match). If the two matching segments differ in
length by more than a factor of 2 then we consider <br>
the duplicate to be either a subset (-) or a superset (+).
Finally, we also note if two lines are the result of
splitting a continuous line across the Dateline (|). For
<br>
polygons we also consider the fractional difference in
areas; duplicates must differ by less than amax [0.01]. By
default, we compute the mean line separation. Use +Ccmin
<br>
to instead compute the median line separation and therefore
a robust closeness value. Also by default we consider all
distances between points on one line and another. <br>
Append +p to limit the comparison to points that project
perpendicularly to points on the other line (and not its
extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E+|- ] <br>
Reset the handedness of all polygons to match the given +
(counter-clockwise) or - (clockwise). Implies -Q+.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F[l] Force input data to become
polygons on output, i.e., close them explicitly if not
already closed. Optionally, append l to force line
geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[e|i] <br>
Determine the intersection locations between all pairs of
polygons. Append i to only compute internal (i.e.,
self-intersecting polygons) crossovers or e to only compute
<br>
external (i.e., between paris of polygons) crossovers
[Default is both].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Npfile[+a][+pstart][+r][+z]
<br>
Determine if one (or all, with +a) points of each feature in
the input data are inside any of the polygons given in the
pfile. If inside, then report which polygon it is; <br>
the polygon ID is either taken from the aspatial value
assigned to Z, the segment header (first -Z, then -L are
scanned), or it is assigned the running number that is
ini&acirc; <br>
tialized to start [0]. By default the input segment that are
found to be inside a polygon are written to stdout with the
polygon ID encoded in the segment header as -ZID. <br>
Alternatively, append +r to just report which polygon
contains a feature or +z to have the IDs added as an extra
data column on output. Segments that fail to be inside a
<br>
polygon are not written out. If more than one polygon
contains the same segment we skip the second (and further)
scenario.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q[[-|+]*unit*][+cmin[/max]][+h][+l][+p][+s[a|d]]
<br>
Measure the area of all polygons or length of line segments.
Use -Q+h to append the area to each polygons segment header
[Default simply writes the area to stdout]. For <br>
polygons we also compute the centroid location while for
line data we compute the mid-point (half-length) position.
Append a distance unit to select the unit used (see <br>
UNITS). Note that the area will depend on the current
setting of PROJ_ELLIPSOID; this should be a recent ellipsoid
to get accurate results. The centroid is computed using <br>
the mean of the 3-D Cartesian vectors making up the polygon
vertices, while the area is obtained via an equal-area
projection. For line lengths you may prepend -|+ to the <br>
unit and the calculation will use Flat Earth or Geodesic
algorithms, respectively [Default is great circle
distances]. Normally, all input segments will be be
reflected <br>
on output. Use c to restrict processing to those whose
length (or area for polygons) fall inside the specified
range set by min and max. If max is not set it defaults to
<br>
infinity. To sort the segments based on their lengths or
area, use s and append a for ascending and d for descending
order [ascending]. By default, we consider open <br>
polygons as lines. Append +p to close open polygons and thus
consider all input as polygons, or append +l to consider all
input as lines, even if closed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[unit]west/east/south/north[/zmin/zmax][r]
<br>
west, east, south, and north specify the region of interest,
and you may specify them in decimal degrees or in
[+-]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format. Append r if lower left
<br>
and upper right map coordinates are given instead of
w/e/s/n. The two shorthands -Rg and -Rd stand for global
domain (0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with
<br>
-90/+90 in latitude). Alternatively for grid creation, give
Rcodelon/lat/nx/ny, where code is a 2-character combination
of L, C, R (for left, center, or right) and T, M, <br>
B for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., BL for lower left. This
indicates which point on a rectangular region the lon/lat
coordinate refers to, and the grid dimensions nx and <br>
ny with grid spacings via -I is used to create the
corresponding region. Alternatively, specify the name of an
existing grid file and the -R settings (and grid spacing,
<br>
if applicable) are copied from the grid. Using -Runit
expects projected (Cartesian) coordinates compatible with
chosen -J and we inversely project to determine actual
rec&acirc; <br>
tangular geographic region. For perspective view (-p),
optionally append /zmin/zmax. In case of perspective view
(-p), a z-range (zmin, zmax) can be appended to indicate
<br>
the third dimension. This needs to be done only when using
the -Jz option, not when using only the -p option. In the
latter case a perspective view of the plane is plot&acirc;
<br>
ted, with no third dimension. Clips polygons to the map
region, including map boundary to the polygon as needed. The
result is a closed polygon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Si|j|s|u <br>
Spatial processing of polygons. Choose from -Si which
returns the intersection of polygons (closed), -Su which
returns the union of polygons (closed), -Ss which will split
<br>
polygons that straddle the Dateline, and -Sj which will join
polygons that were split by the Dateline. Note: Only -Ss has
been implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T[clippolygon] <br>
Truncate polygons against the specified polygon given,
possibly resulting in open polygons. If no argument is given
to -T we create a clipping polygon from -R which then <br>
is required. Note that when the -R clipping is in effect we
will also look for polygons of length 4 or 5 that exactly
match the -R clipping polygon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more ...) <br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bi[ncols][t] (more ...) <br>
Select native binary input. [Default is 2 input
columns].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bo[ncols][type] (more ...) <br>
Select native binary output. [Default is same as input].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[i|o]nodata (more ...) <br>
Replace input columns that equal nodata with NaN and do the
reverse on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more ...) <br>
Specify data types of input and/or output columns.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g[a]x|y|d|X|Y|D|[col]z[+|-]gap[u]
(more ...) <br>
Determine data gaps and line breaks.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h[i|o][n][+c][+d][+rremark][+rtitle]
(more ...) <br>
Skip or produce header record(s).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icols[l][sscale][ooffset][,...]
(more ...) <br>
Select input columns (0 is first column).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ocols[,...] (more ...) <br>
Select output columns (0 is first column).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-:[i|o] (more ...) <br>
Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows use just -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
For map distance unit, append unit d for arc degree, m for
arc minute, and s for arc second, or e for meter [Default],
f for foot, k for km, M for statute mile, n for nautical
<br>
mile, and u for US survey foot. By default we compute such
distances using a spherical approximation with great
circles. Prepend - to a distance (or the unit is no distance
is <br>
given) to perform &quot;Flat Earth&quot; calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend + to perform exact
geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII FORMAT PRECISION <br>
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by
parameters in your gmt.conf file. Longitude and latitude are
formatted according to FORMAT_GEO_OUT, whereas other <br>
values are formatted according to FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT. Be aware
that the format in effect can lead to loss of precision in
the output, which can lead to various problems downstream.
<br>
If you find the output is not written with enough precision,
consider switching to binary output (-bo if available) or
specify more decimals using the FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
OGR/GMT files are considered complete datasets and thus you
cannot specify more than one at a given time. This causes
problems if you want to examine the intersections of two
<br>
OGR/GMT files. The solution is to convert them to regular
datasets via gmtconvert and then run gmtspatial on the
converted files.</p>
