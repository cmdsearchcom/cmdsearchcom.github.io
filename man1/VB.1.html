<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
VB - Visual Builder for the Prima toolkit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Visual Builder is a RAD-style suite for designing forms
under the Prima toolkit. It provides rich set of
perl-composed widgets, whose can be inserted into a form by
simple <br>
actions. The form can be stored in a file and loaded by
either user program or a simple wrapper,
&quot;utils/prima-fmview.pl&quot;; the form can be also
stored as a valid perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A form file typically has .fm
extension, an can be loaded by using Prima::VB::VBLoader
module. The following example is the only content of
&quot;prima-fmview.pl&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Prima qw(Application
VB::VBLoader); <br>
my $ret = Prima::VBLoad( $ARGV[0] ); <br>
die &quot;$@0 unless $ret; <br>
$ret-&gt; execute;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and is usually sufficient for
executing a form file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
The builder provides three main windows, that are used for
designing. These are called main panel, object inspector and
form window. When the builder is started, the form window
<br>
is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main panel consists of the
menu bar, speed buttons and the widget buttons. If the user
presses a widget button, and then clicks the mouse on the
form window, the designated <br>
widget is inserted into the form and becomes a child of the
form window. If the click was made on a visible widget in
the form window, the newly inserted widget becomes a <br>
children of that widget. After the widget is inserted, its
properties are accessible via the object inspector
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The menu bar contains the
following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File <br>
New Closes the current form and opens a new, empty form. If
the old form was not saved, the user is asked if the changes
made have to be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is an alias to a
&rsquo;new file&rsquo; icon on the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open <br>
Invokes a file open dialog, so a .fm form file can be
opened. After the successful file load, all form widgets are
visible and available for editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is an alias to an
&rsquo;open folder&rsquo; icon on the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save <br>
Stores the form into a file. The user here can select a type
of the file to be saved. If the form is saved as .fm form
file, then it can be re-loaded either in the <br>
builder or in the user program ( see Prima::VB::VBLoader for
details ). If the form is saved as .pl program, then it can
not be loaded; instead, the program can be run <br>
immediately without the builder or any supplementary
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the user assigned a name
and a type for the form, it is never asked when selecting
this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is an alias to a
&rsquo;save on disk&rsquo; icon on the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save as <br>
Same as Save, except that a new name or type of file are
asked every time the command is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close <br>
Closes the form and removes the form window. If the form
window was changed, the user is asked if the changes made
have to be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit <br>
Copy <br>
Copies the selected widgets into the clipboard, so they can
be inserted later by using Paste command. The form window
can not be copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste <br>
Reads the information, put by the builder Copy command into
the clipboard, and inserts the widgets into the form window.
The child-parent relation is kept by names of the <br>
widgets; if the widget with the name of the parent of the
clipboard-read widgets is not found, the widgets are
inserted into the form window. The form window is not <br>
affected by this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete <br>
Deletes the selected widgets. The form window can not be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select all <br>
Selects all of the widgets, inserted in the form window,
except the form window itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate <br>
Duplicates the selected widgets. The form window is not
affected by this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Align <br>
This menu item contains z-ordering actions, that are
performed on selected widgets. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bring to front Send to back Step
forward Step backward Restore order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change class <br>
Changes the class of an inserted widget. This is an advanced
option, and can lead to confusions or errors, if the default
widget class and the supplied class differ too much. <br>
It is used when the widget that has to be inserted is not
present in the builder installation. Also, it is called
implicitly when a loaded form does not contain a valid <br>
widget class; in such case Prima::Widget class is
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creation order <br>
Opens the dialog, that manages the creation order of the
widgets. It is not that important for the widget
child-parent relation, since the builder tracks these, and
does not <br>
allow a child to be created before its parent. However, the
explicit order might be helpful in a case, when, for
example, &quot;tabOrder&quot; property is left to its
default value, so <br>
it is assigned according to the order of widget
creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Toggle lock <br>
Changes the lock status for selected widgets. The lock, if
set, prevents a widget from being selected by mouse, to
avoid occasional positional changes. This is useful when a
<br>
widget is used as owner for many sub-widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+mouse click locks and
unlocks a widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View <br>
Object inspector <br>
Brings the object inspector window, if it was hidden or
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add widgets <br>
Opens a file dialog, where the additional VB modules can be
located. The modules are used for providing custom widgets
and properties for the builder. As an example, the <br>
Prima/VB/examples/Widgety.pm module is provided with the
builder and the toolkit. Look inside this file for the
implementation details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset guidelines <br>
Reset the guidelines on the form window into a center
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap to guidelines <br>
Specifies if the moving and resizing widget actions must
treat the form window guidelines as snapping areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap to grid <br>
Specifies if the moving and resizing widget actions must use
the form window grid granularity instead of the pixel
granularity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run This command hides the form
and object inspector windows and &rsquo;executes&rsquo; the
form, as if it would be run by &quot;prima-fmview.pl&quot;.
The execution session ends either by <br>
closing the form window or by calling Break command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is an alias to a
&rsquo;run&rsquo; icon on the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Break <br>
Explicitly terminates the execution session, initiated by
Run command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
About <br>
Displays the information about the visual builder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
Displays the information about the usage of the visual
builder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Widget property <br>
Invokes a help viewer on Prima::Widget manpage and tries to
open a topic, corresponding to the current selection of the
object inspector property or event list. While <br>
this manpage covers far not all ( but still many )
properties and events, it is still a little bit more
convenient than nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Form window <br>
The form widget is a common parent for all widgets, created
by the builder. The form window provides the following basic
navigation functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guidelines <br>
The form window contains two guidelines, the horizontal and
the vertical, drawn as blue dashed lines. Dragging with the
mouse can move these lines. If menu option &quot;Snap to
<br>
guidelines&quot; is on, the widgets moving and sizing
operations treat the guidelines as the snapping areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selection <br>
A widget can be selected by clicking with the mouse on it.
There can be more than one selected widget at a time, or
none at all. To explicitly select a widget in addition to
<br>
the already selected ones, hold the &quot;shift&quot; key
while clicking on a widget. This combination also deselects
the widget. To select all widgets on the form window, call
&quot;Select <br>
all&quot; command from the menu. To prevent widgets from
being occasionally selected, lock them with
&quot;Edit/Toggle lock&quot; command or Ctrl+mouse
click.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moving <br>
Dragging the mouse can move the selected widgets. The
widgets can be snapped to the grid or the guidelines during
the move. If one of the moving widgets is selected in the
<br>
object inspector window, the coordinate changes are
reflected in the &quot;origin&quot; property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;Tab&quot; key is
pressed during the move, the mouse pointer is changed
between three states, each reflecting the currently
accessible coordinates for dragging. The default <br>
accessible coordinates are both the horizontal and the
vertical; other two are the horizontal only and the vertical
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sizing <br>
The sizeable widgets can be dynamically resized. Regardless
to the amount of the selected widgets, only one widget at a
time can be resized. If the resized widget is <br>
selected in the object inspector window, the size changes
are reflected in the &quot;size&quot; property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context menus <br>
The right-click ( or the other system-defined pop-up menu
invocation command) provides the menu, identical to the main
panel&rsquo;s Edit submenu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternative context menus
can be provided with some widgets ( for example,
&quot;TabbedNotebook&quot; ), and are accessible with
&quot;control + right click&quot; combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object inspector window <br>
The inspector window reflects the events and properties of a
widget. To explicitly select a widget, it must be either
clicked by the mouse on the form window, or selected in the
<br>
widget combo-box. Depending on whether the properties or the
events are selected, the left panel of the inspector
provides the properties or events list, and the right panel
- a <br>
value of the currently selected property or event. To toggle
between the properties and the events, use the button below
the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The adjustable properties of a
widget include an incomplete set of the properties, returned
by the class method &quot;profile_default&quot; ( the
detailed explanation see in <br>
Prima::Object). Among these are such basic properties as
&quot;origin&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;name&quot;,
&quot;color&quot;, &quot;font&quot;, &quot;visible&quot;,
&quot;enabled&quot;, &quot;owner&quot; and many others. All
the widgets share some <br>
common denominator, but almost all provide their own
intrinsic properties. Each property can be selected by the
right-pane hosted property selector; in such case, the name
of a <br>
property is highlighted in the list - that means, that the
property is initialized. To remove a property from the
initialization list, double-click on it, so it is grayed
again. <br>
Some very basic properties as &quot;name&quot; can not be
deselected. This is because the builder keeps a name-keyed
list; another consequence of this fact is that no widgets of
same name <br>
can exist simultaneously within the builder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The events, much like the
properties, are accessible for direct change. All the events
provide a small editor, so the custom code can be supplied.
This code is executed when <br>
the form is run or loaded via
&quot;Prima::VB::VBLoader&quot; interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full explanation of
properties and events is not provided here. It is not even
the goal of this document, because the builder can work with
the widgets irrespective of their <br>
property or event capabilities; this information is
extracted by native toolkit functionality. To read on what
each property or event means, use the documentation on the
class of <br>
interest; Prima::Widget is a good start because it
encompasses the ground &quot;Prima::Widget&quot;
functionality. The other widgets are ( hopefully )
documented in their modules, for <br>
example, &quot;Prima::ScrollBar&quot; documentation can be
found in Prima::ScrollBar.</p>
