VB - Visual Builder for the Prima toolkit
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Visual Builder is a RAD-style suite for designing forms under the Prima toolkit.
  It provides rich set of perl-composed widgets, whose can be inserted into a
  form by simple actions. The form can be stored in a file and loaded by either
  user program or a simple wrapper, &quot;utils/prima-fmview.pl&quot;; the form
  can be also stored as a valid perl program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A form file typically has <i>.fm</i> extension, an can be loaded by using
  Prima::VB::VBLoader module. The following example is the only content of
  &quot;prima-fmview.pl&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        use Prima qw(Application VB::VBLoader);
        my $ret = Prima::VBLoad( $ARGV[0] );
        die &quot;$@\n&quot; unless $ret;
        $ret-&gt; execute;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and is usually sufficient for executing a form file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Help"><a class="selflink" href="#Help">Help</a></h1>
The builder provides three main windows, that are used for designing. These are
  called <i>main panel</i>, <i>object inspector</i> and <i>form window</i>. When
  the builder is started, the form window is empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main panel consists of the menu bar, speed buttons and the widget buttons.
  If the user presses a widget button, and then clicks the mouse on the form
  window, the designated widget is inserted into the form and becomes a child of
  the form window. If the click was made on a visible widget in the form window,
  the newly inserted widget becomes a children of that widget. After the widget
  is inserted, its properties are accessible via the object inspector window.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The menu bar contains the following commands:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">File</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">New</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Closes the current form and opens a new, empty form. If the
      old form was not saved, the user is asked if the changes made have to be
      saved.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This command is an alias to a 'new file' icon on the panel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Open</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invokes a file open dialog, so a <i>.fm</i> form file can
      be opened. After the successful file load, all form widgets are visible
      and available for editing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This command is an alias to an 'open folder' icon on the panel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Save</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Stores the form into a file. The user here can select a
      type of the file to be saved. If the form is saved as <i>.fm</i> form
      file, then it can be re-loaded either in the builder or in the user
      program ( see Prima::VB::VBLoader for details ). If the form is saved as
      <i>.pl</i> program, then it can not be loaded; instead, the program can be
      run immediately without the builder or any supplementary code.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Once the user assigned a name and a type for the form, it is never asked
      when selecting this command.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This command is an alias to a 'save on disk' icon on the panel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      widget that has to be inserted is not present in the builder installation.
      Also, it is called implicitly when a loaded form does not contain a valid

      before its parent. However, the explicit order might be helpful in a case,
      when, for example, &quot;tabOrder&quot; property is left to its default

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Form_window"><a class="selflink" href="#Form_window">Form
  window</a></h2>
The form widget is a common parent for all widgets, created by the builder. The
  form window provides the following basic navigation functionality.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Guidelines</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The form window contains two guidelines, the horizontal and
      the vertical, drawn as blue dashed lines. Dragging with the mouse can move
      these lines. If menu option &quot;Snap to guidelines&quot; is on, the
      widgets moving and sizing operations treat the guidelines as the snapping
      areas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Selection</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A widget can be selected by clicking with the mouse on it.
      There can be more than one selected widget at a time, or none at all. To
      explicitly select a widget in addition to the already selected ones, hold
      the &quot;shift&quot; key while clicking on a widget. This combination
      also deselects the widget. To select all widgets on the form window, call
      &quot;Select all&quot; command from the menu. To prevent widgets from
      being occasionally selected, lock them with &quot;Edit/Toggle lock&quot;
      command or Ctrl+mouse click.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Moving</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Dragging the mouse can move the selected widgets. The
      widgets can be snapped to the grid or the guidelines during the move. If
      one of the moving widgets is selected in the object inspector window, the
      coordinate changes are reflected in the &quot;origin&quot; property.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the &quot;Tab&quot; key is pressed during the move, the mouse pointer is
      changed between three states, each reflecting the currently accessible
      coordinates for dragging. The default accessible coordinates are both the
      horizontal and the vertical; other two are the horizontal only and the
      vertical only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Sizing</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The sizeable widgets can be dynamically resized. Regardless
      to the amount of the selected widgets, only one widget at a time can be
      resized. If the resized widget is selected in the object inspector window,
      the size changes are reflected in the &quot;size&quot; property.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Context menus</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The right-click ( or the other system-defined pop-up menu
      invocation command) provides the menu, identical to the main panel's Edit
      submenu.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The alternative context menus can be provided with some widgets ( for
      example, &quot;TabbedNotebook&quot; ), and are accessible with
      &quot;control + right click&quot; combination.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Object_inspector_window"><a class="selflink" href="#Object_inspector_window">Object
  inspector window</a></h2>
The inspector window reflects the events and properties of a widget. To
  explicitly select a widget, it must be either clicked by the mouse on the form
  window, or selected in the widget combo-box. Depending on whether the
  properties or the events are selected, the left panel of the inspector
  provides the properties or events list, and the right panel - a value of the
  currently selected property or event. To toggle between the properties and the
  events, use the button below the list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The adjustable properties of a widget include an incomplete set of the
  properties, returned by the class method &quot;profile_default&quot; ( the
  detailed explanation see in Prima::Object). Among these are such basic
  properties as &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;name&quot;,
  &quot;color&quot;, &quot;font&quot;, &quot;visible&quot;, &quot;enabled&quot;,
  &quot;owner&quot; and many others. All the widgets share some common
  denominator, but almost all provide their own intrinsic properties. Each
  property can be selected by the right-pane hosted property selector; in such
  case, the name of a property is highlighted in the list - that means, that the
  property is initialized. To remove a property from the initialization list,
  double-click on it, so it is grayed again. Some very basic properties as
  &quot;name&quot; can not be deselected. This is because the builder keeps a
  name-keyed list; another consequence of this fact is that no widgets of same
  name can exist simultaneously within the builder.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The events, much like the properties, are accessible for direct change. All the
  events provide a small editor, so the custom code can be supplied. This code
  is executed when the form is run or loaded via &quot;Prima::VB::VBLoader&quot;
  interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The full explanation of properties and events is not provided here. It is not
  even the goal of this document, because the builder can work with the widgets
  irrespective of their property or event capabilities; this information is
  extracted by native toolkit functionality. To read on what each property or
  event means, use the documentation on the class of interest; Prima::Widget is
  a good start because it encompasses the ground &quot;Prima::Widget&quot;
  functionality. The other widgets are ( hopefully ) documented in their
  modules, for example, &quot;Prima::ScrollBar&quot; documentation can be found
  in Prima::ScrollBar.
