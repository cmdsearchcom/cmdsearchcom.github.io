<p>C44(1) DjVuLibre-3.5 C44(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
c44 - DjVuPhoto encode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
c44 [options] inputfilename [outputfilename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Produces a DjVuPhoto encoded image. The input image file
inputfilename can be either a portable gray-map (PGM) or a
portable pix-map (PPM). Input images compressed with JPEG
<br>
are also accepted. It is however suggested to only use high
quality JPEG files (low compression ratio, large size)
because the wavelet compression will increase the defects
<br>
already present in highly compressed JPEG files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program produces a DjVuPhoto
file outputfilename. If the output file name is not
specified, a default file name will be generated by
replacing the input file name suffix by <br>
suffix djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main design objective for
the DjVu wavelets consisted of allowing progressive
rendering and smooth scrolling of large images with limited
memory requirements. Decoding func&acirc; <br>
tions process the compressed data and update a memory
efficient representation of the wavelet coefficients.
Imaging function then can quickly render an arbitrary
segment of the <br>
image using the available data. Both process can be carried
out in two threads of execution. This design plays an
important role in the DjVu system. We investigated various
<br>
state-of-the-art wavelet compression schemes. Although these
schemes may achieve slightly smaller file sizes, the
decoding functions did not even approach our requirements.
The <br>
IW44 wavelets reach these requirements today and may in the
future implement more modern refinements if these
refinements can be implemented within our constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUALITY SELECTION OPTIONS <br>
DjVuPhoto files are logically composed of a sequence of
&quot;slices&quot; containing successive image refinements.
Slices are grouped in &quot;chunks&quot; defining the
progressive rendering <br>
sequence. The viewer is able to display an intermediate
image after processing each chunk. A typical DjVuPhoto files
contains 80 to 120 slices grouped into 1 to 4 chunks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quality selection options
provide various ways to specify the number of chunks and the
number of slices per chunk. The c44 program adds slices to
the current chunk until <br>
exceeding a target number of slices, a target file size, or
a target quality specification. The following options define
targets for each chunk. The option argument contain <br>
several numerical values (one per chunk) separated by either
commas or pluses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-slice n+...+n <br>
Specify the number of slices in each chunk. The option
argument contains plus-separated numerical values (one per
chunk) indicating the number of slices per chunk. <br>
Option -slice 74+13+10, for instance, would be appropriate
for compressing a photographic image with three progressive
refinements. More quality and more refinements can <br>
be obtained with option -slice 72+11+10+10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-slice n,...,n <br>
Specify the cumulative number of slices for each chunk.
Since the final quality is determined by the total number of
slices, it is often more convenient to use comma-sep&acirc;
<br>
arated values (one per chunk) indicating the cumulative
number of slices for each chunk (i.e. including those
encoded in all previous chunks). The values suggested above
<br>
can also be expressed as -slice 74,87,97 and -slice
72,83,93,103.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size n,...,n <br>
Specify size targets for each chunk expressed in bytes. The
option argument can be either a plus-separated list
specifying a size for each chunk, or a comma separated <br>
list specifying cumulative sizes for each chunk and all
previous chunks. Size targets are approximates. Slices will
be added to each chunk until exceeding the specified <br>
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bpp n,...,n <br>
Specify size targets for each chunk expressed in
bits-per-pixel. Both comma-separated and plus-separated
specifications are accepted. Option -bpp 0.25,0.5,1 usually
pro&acirc; <br>
vides good results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-percent n,...,n <br>
Specify size targets for each chunk expressed as a
percentage of the input file size. Both comma-separated and
plus-separated specifications are accepted. Results can be
<br>
drastically different according to the format of the input
image (raw or JPEG compressed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-decibel n,...,n <br>
Specify quality targets for each chunk expressed as a
comma-separated list of increasing decibel values. Decibel
values range from 16 (very low quality) to 48 (very high
<br>
quality). This criterion should not be relied upon when
re-encoding an image previously compressed by another
compression scheme. Selecting this option significantly <br>
increases the compression time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dbfrac frac <br>
Indicate that the decibel values specified in option
-decibel should be computed by averaging the mean squared
errors of only the fraction frac of the most mis-represented
<br>
blocks of 32 x 32 pixels. This option is useful with
composite images containing solid color features (e.g. an
image with a large white border).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Providing no quality
specification options automatically selects a default
quality specification -slice 74,89,99. Multiple quality
specification options are allowed. The pro&acirc; <br>
gram outputs a file whose total number of chunks is the
largest number of chunks of all quality specifications.
Slices are added to each chunk until reaching any of the
quality <br>
target for this chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
The following additional options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dpi n Specify the resolution
information encoded into the output file expressed in dots
per inch. The resolution information encoded in DjVu files
determine how the decoder <br>
scales the image on a particular display. Meaningful
resolutions range from 25 to 1200. The default value, 100
dpi, should be suitable for most photographic images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma n <br>
Specify the gamma correction information encoded into the
output file. The argument n specified the gamma value of the
device for which the input image was designed. The <br>
default value is 2.2. This is appropriate for images
designed for a standard computer monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mask pbmfilename <br>
The design of the IW44 wavelets allows for compressing
partially masked images. This option can be used when
certain pixels of a background image are going to be covered
<br>
by foreground objects like text or drawings. File pbmfile
must be a PBM file whose size matches the size of the input
file. Each black pixel in pbmfile means that the <br>
value of the corresponding pixel in the input file is
irrelevant. The IW44 encoder will replace the masked pixels
by a color value whose coding cost is minimal (see <br>
http://www.djvuzone.org/djvu/techpapers/mask/index.djvu for
technical details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crcbnormal <br>
Select normal chrominance encoding. Chrominance information
is encoded at the same resolution as the luminance. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crcbhalf <br>
Selects half resolution chrominance encoding. Chrominance
information is encoded at half the luminance resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crcbdelay n <br>
This option can be used with -crcbnormal and -crcbhalf to
modify the quality of the chrominance information. The
option arguments specifies a parameter n, expressed in <br>
slices, that reduces the bit-rate associated with the
chrominance. The default chrominance encoding delay is 10
slices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crcbfull <br>
Select the highest possible quality for encoding the
chrominance information. This is equivalent to specifying
-crcbnormal and -crcbdelay 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crcbnone <br>
Disable the encoding of the chrominance. Only the luminance
information will be encoded. The resulting image will show
in shades of gray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMARKS <br>
The default quality setting of the DjVuLibre version of c44
has been increased. It produces larger files with a better
quality. Quality can be lowered using the quality
selec&acirc; <br>
tion options!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The encoder requires more memory than necessary. <br>
The rechunking capability is currently broken.</p>
