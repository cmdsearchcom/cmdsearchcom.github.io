<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
msort - sort records in complex ways</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
msort &lt;options&gt; [&lt;input file&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
msort is a program for sorting text files in sophisticated
ways. It was developed initially for alphabetizing
dictionaries of languages in which the ordering may be quite
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent from English but has many other uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msort allows you to sort blocks
of text delimited in a number of ways rather than just lines
and to specify particular fields of a record as sort keys
using either their posi&acirc; <br>
tion, counted from either end, or by matching regular
expressions to their tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msort is capable of sorting on
multiple keys, so that when two records tie on one key, the
tie may be broken on another. Any or all keys may be
optional. How absent optional <br>
keys are ordered with respect to present keys may be set
separately for each key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msort allows you to specify
arbitrary sort orders and to define virtually unlimited
numbers of multigraphs of effectively unlimited length. The
sort order and multigraphs are <br>
defined separately for each key. If your system has locale
support, you can also use locale collation rules instead of
specify your own sort order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msort provides twelve types of
key comparison: lexicographic, numeric, numeric string,
hybrid, by string length, by angle, by date, by domain name,
by time, by ISO8601 date/time <br>
stamp, by month name, and random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What month names are used is a
bit complicated. If the -s flag is used on the same key and
its argument is the name of a file, the month names are read
from the file, which <br>
should be in the same format as a sort order definition
file. If the -s flag is used and its argument is a locale
name, the month names recognized will be the month names and
<br>
abbreviations associated with the specified locale. If the
-s flag is not used the month names recognized will be the
month names and abbreviations associated with the current
<br>
locale. If your system does not have locale support and you
do not use the -s flag to read the month names from a file,
the month names recognized will be the English month names
<br>
and abbreviations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msort can reverse the characters
in a key, allowing it to be used to generate reverse
dictionaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A choice of sorting algorithms
is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msort fully supports Unicode.
The text to be sorted, and all specifications, should be in
UTF-8 Unicode. (If you have plain ASCII text, this is not a
problem as ASCII is a subset <br>
of Unicode.) Full Unicode case-folding is available, in
Turkic and non-Turkic variants. Unicode normalization is
performed before sorting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For usage information, execute
msort with no arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full information about msort is
currently to be found in the reference manual, which is
distributed as a PDF (Portable Document Format) file. If a
copy is not available locally, <br>
you can download it from msort&rsquo;s home page: <br>
http://billposer.org/Software/msort.html</p>

List the supported number systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options <br>
-b,--block <br>
A record is terminated by two or more newlines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l,--line <br>
A record consists of a single line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r,--record-separator
&lt;separator&gt; <br>
A record is terminated by separator character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O,--fixed-size-record
&lt;bytes&gt; <br>
A record consists of the specified number of bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d,--field-separators
&lt;character&gt;+ <br>
Fields are delimited by the named character(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w,--whole <br>
Sort on the entire text of the record</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a,--algorithm &lt;algorithm&gt;
<br>
Use the specified sort algorithm. The choices are:
I(nsertionSort), M(ergeSort), Q(uickSort), and S(hellSort).
Note that InsertionSort and MergeSort are stable, while <br>
QuickSort and ShellSort are unstable. The default is
QuickSort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M,-initial-maximum-records
&lt;records&gt; <br>
Set initial maximum number of records</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m,--line-end-carriage-return
<br>
End-of-line in the input data is marked by Carriage Return
(0x0D) as on the Macintosh rather than by Line Feed (0x0A)
as on Unix systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I,--invert-globally <br>
Invert sense of comparisons globally</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B,--BMP <br>
No characters fall outside the Basic Multingual Plane (that
is, have values greater than 0xFFFF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z,--skip-first-record <br>
Copy the first record in the input to the output without
sorting it. This is useful for sorting files with a
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p,--reserve-private-use-area
<br>
Do not make internal use of the Private Use areas. By
default, multigraphs are assigned internally to codepoints
in the Supplementary Private Use areas if full Unicode is
<br>
in use or to codepoints in the Private Use area if input is
restricted to the Basic Multilingual Plane by means of the
-B option. If your input makes use of the Private <br>
Use areas, this option prevents interference with your
input. In this case, multigraphs will be assigned to the Low
and High Surrogate areas (0xD800-0xDFFF). Note that <br>
this limits the number of multigraphs to 2,048.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P,--random-seed &lt;seed&gt;
<br>
Set the seed for the random number generator. If not set
here, it is set to a value determined by the time. The seed
used is reported in the log. This option allows runs <br>
to be replicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q,--check-only <br>
Check whether the input is already sorted. Do not generate
any output. Exit status is 0 if input is already sorted, 11
if not sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1,--in &lt;input file
name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2,--out &lt;output file
name&gt; <br>
If the output file is the same as the input file, the input
file will be overwritten. The input file will not be
overwritten if the run is unsuccessful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j,--suppress-log <br>
Suppress output to the log. If this flag is given before
there is any output to the log from a command line flag,
nothing will be written to the log and the log file will
<br>
not be created. If a command line flag generates a log
message before this flag is processed, the log file will be
created but no log messages will be written to it once <br>
this flag is processed. To guarantee that no attempt will be
made to open a log file, give this flag first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q,--quiet <br>
Be quiet - do not chat while working</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u,--unicode-normalization
&lt;mode&gt; <br>
Select Unicode normalization mode. The choices of mode are:
c for normalization form C (NFC), d for normalization form D
(NFD), C for normalization form KC (NFKC), D for <br>
normalization form KD (NFKD), and n for no normalization.
The default is NFC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key specific options <br>
-e,--character-range &lt;m,n&gt; <br>
Sort on characters m through n. Positive indices start from
one. Negative indices indicate position with respect to the
end of the record. For example, the range 3,-2 <br>
consists of the third character through the next-to-last
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n,--position
&lt;POS&gt;(,&lt;POS&gt;) <br>
Sort on the specified POS or contiguous range of POSs, where
a POS is of the form &lt;field number&gt;(.&lt;character
number&gt;). Both counts begin at one. Field numbers but not
<br>
character numbers may be negative, in which case they are
counted from the right. Thus, 1.2 is the second character of
the first field; -2.1 is the first character of the <br>
next to last field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t,--tag &lt;tag regexp&gt; <br>
Sort on the field with the specified tag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o,--optional &lt;comparison&gt;
<br>
Optional: compare as (&lt;,=,&gt;) to present key if
absent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C,--fold-case <br>
Fold case</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z,--fold-case-turkic <br>
Fold case with additional Turkic conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c,--comparison-type
&lt;comparison type&gt; <br>
a(ngle),l(exicographic), i(so8601 date/time), t(ime),
D(omain name/email address), d(ate), m(onth name),
n(umeric), N(umeric string),s(ize), h(hybrid), r(andom)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y,--number-system &lt;number
system&gt; <br>
Specifies the number system expected for this key. This
affects only numeric and numeric string keys. There are two
special values. If the number system is &quot;all&quot;,
records <br>
may contain any number system that msort can interpret.
Different records may contain different number systems. If
the number system is &quot;any&quot;, records may contain
any <br>
writing system that msort can interpret, but all records
must make use of the same number system. msort sets the
number system on the basis of the first record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f,--date-format &lt;date
format&gt; <br>
Permutation of ymd with separators, e.g. y-m-d for
international date format, m/d/y for American date format,
or a permutation of yd with separators, e.g. y-d, for
day-of- <br>
year dates. All three components may be numbers in any
available number system. The month field may also be a month
name, determined by the same devices as independent <br>
month name fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W,--sort-order-file-separators
&lt;file name&gt; <br>
Read the list of characters to be treated as separators in
the sort order definition file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S,--substitutions &lt;file
name&gt; <br>
Read substitutions from named file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s,--sort-order &lt;file
name&gt;|&lt;locale name&gt;|&quot;locale&quot; <br>
If the argument is a file name, it is taken to be a sort
order file and the sort order for the key is read from the
file. If the argument is a locale name, the collation <br>
rules for that locale are used. If the argument is
&quot;locale&quot;, the collation rules for the current
locale are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T,--transformations
&lt;(d)(e)(s)&gt; <br>
Apply the specified transformations. d specifies that
diacritics are to be stripped. Separately encoded combining
diacritics are removed. Characters with diacritics
rep&acirc; <br>
resented by single codepoints are replaced with the
corresponding ASCII character without the diacritics, if
there is one. e specifies that enclosed characters, that
<br>
is, characters within circles or parentheses, are to be
replaced with the corresponding plain ASCII character if
there is one. s specifies that characters in special <br>
styles are to be replaced with the corresponding plain ASCII
character if there is one. Stylistic equivalents include:
small capitals (e.g. U+1D04), script forms (e.g. <br>
U+212C), black letter forms (e.g. U+212D), Arabic
presentation forms (e.g. U+FE81), Hebrew presentation forms
(e.g. U+FB1D), fullwidth forms (e.g. U+FF01), halfwidth
forms <br>
(e.g. U+FF7B), and the mathematical alphanumeric symbols
(e.g. U+1D400).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x,--exclusion-file &lt;file
name&gt; <br>
Read exclusions from named file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X,--exclude-characters
&lt;exclusions&gt; <br>
Exclude specified characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i,--invert-locally <br>
Invert sense of comparisons</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R,--reverse-key <br>
Reverse characters of key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A,--first-character-only <br>
Ignore all but the first character of the field, after
substitutions, exclusions, etc.</p>
