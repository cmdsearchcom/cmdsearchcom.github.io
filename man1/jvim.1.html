<p>VIM(1) General Commands Manual VIM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vim [options] [file ..] <br>
vim [options] -t tag <br>
vim [options] -e [errorfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. It
can be used to edit any ASCII text. It is especially useful
for editing programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a lot of enhancements
above vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers,
command line editing, filename completion, on-line help,
visual selection, etc.. Read dif&acirc; <br>
ference.doc for a summary of the differences between vi and
Vim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most often Vim is started to
edit a single file with the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vim file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More generally VIM is started
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vim [options] [filelist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filelist is missing, the
editor will start with an empty buffer. Otherwise exactly
one out of the following three may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file .. A list of file names.
The first one (alphabetically) will be the current file and
read into the buffer. The cursor will be positioned on the
first line of the buffer. <br>
You can get to the other files with the &quot;:next&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t {tag} The file to edit and
the initial cursor position depends on a &quot;tag&quot;, a
sort of goto label. {tag} is looked up in the tags file, the
associated file becomes the cur&acirc; <br>
rent file and the associated command is executed. Mostly
this is used for C programs. {tag} then should be a function
name. The effect is that the file containing <br>
that function becomes the current file and the cursor is
positioned on the start of the function (see reference.doc,
section &quot;tag searches&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [errorfile] <br>
Start in quickFix mode. The file [errorfile] is read and the
first error is displayed. If [errorfile] is omitted the file
name is obtained from the &rsquo;errorfile&rsquo; option
<br>
(defaults to &quot;AztecC.Err&quot; for the Amiga,
&quot;errors&quot; on other systems). Further errors can be
jumped to with the &quot;:cn&quot; command. See
reference.doc section 5.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options, if present, must precede the filelist. The
options may be given in any order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Recovery mode. The swap file
is used to recover a crashed editing session. The swap file
is a file with the same file name as the text file with
&quot;.swp&quot; appended. See <br>
reference.doc, chapter &quot;Recovery after a
crash&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v View mode. The
&rsquo;readonly&rsquo; option will be set. You can still
edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file. If you do want to overwrite a <br>
file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in
&quot;:w!&quot;. The -v option also implies the -n option
(see below). The &rsquo;readonly&rsquo; option can be reset
with &quot;:set <br>
noro&quot; (see reference.doc, options chapter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Binary. A few options will be
set that makes it possible to edit a binary or executable
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[num] For the first file the
cursor will be positioned on line &quot;num&quot;. If
&quot;num&quot; is missing, the cursor will be positioned on
the last line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/pat For the first file the
cursor will be positioned on the first occurrence of
&quot;pat&quot; (see reference.doc, section &quot;pattern
searches&quot; for the available search patterns).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+{command}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c {command} <br>
{command} will be executed after the first file has been
read. {command} is interpreted as an Ex command. If the
{command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in dou&acirc;
<br>
ble quotes (this depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim &quot;+set si&quot; main.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x (Amiga only) Vim is not
restarted to open a new window. This option should be used
when Vim is executed by a program that will wait for the
edit session to finish <br>
(e.g. mail). The &quot;:sh&quot; and &quot;:!&quot; commands
will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o[N] Open N windows. When N is
omitted, open one window for each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible. Handy if you want
to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy). Can also
be done with <br>
&quot;:set uc=0&quot;. Can be undone with &quot;:set
uc=200&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s {scriptin} <br>
The script file {scriptin} is read. The characters in the
file are interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can
be done with the command &quot;:source! {scriptin}&quot;.
<br>
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits,
further characters are read from the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w {scriptout} <br>
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit VIM. This is useful if you want
to create a script file to be used with &quot;vim -s&quot;
<br>
or &quot;:source!&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T terminal Tells Vim the name
of the terminal you are using. Should be a terminal known to
Vim (builtin) or defined in the termcap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d device Open
&quot;device&quot; for use as a terminal. Only on the Amiga.
Example: &quot;-d con:20/30/600/150&quot;.</p>
