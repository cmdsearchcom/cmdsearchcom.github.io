<p>htdig(1) General Commands Manual htdig(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
htdig - retrieve HTML documents for ht://Dig search
engine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
htdig [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and
gathers information from these documents which can later be
used to search these documents. This program can be <br>
referred to as the search robot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
- Get the list of URLs to start indexing from standard
input. This will override the default parameter start_url
specified in the config file and the file supplied to the
<br>
-m option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Use alternate work files.
Tells htdig to append .work to database files, causing a
second copy of the database to be built. This allows the
original files to be used by <br>
htsearch during the indexing run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c configfile <br>
Use the specified configfile instead of the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h maxhops <br>
Restrict the dig to documents that are at most maxhops links
away from the starting document. This only works if option
-i is also given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Initial. Do not use any old
databases. Old databases will be erased before running the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m filename <br>
Minimal run. Only index the URLs given in the file filename,
ignoring all others. URLs in the file should be formatted
one URL per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Print statistics about the
dig after completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Create an ASCII version of
the document database. This database is easy to parse with
other programs so that information can be extracted from it
for purposes other than <br>
searching. One could gather some interesting statistics from
this database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fieldname Value <br>
u URL <br>
t Title <br>
a State <br>
(0 normal, 1 not found, 2 not indexed, 3 obsolete) <br>
m Time of last modification reported by the server <br>
s Document Size in bytes <br>
H Excerpt of the document <br>
h Meta Description <br>
l Time of last retrieval <br>
L Count of links in the document or of outgoing links <br>
b Number of links to the document, also called <br>
incoming links or backlinks <br>
c Hop count of this document <br>
g Signature of this document <br>
(used to detect duplicates) <br>
e E-Mail address to use for a notification from htnotify
<br>
n Date on which such notification is sent <br>
S Subject of the notifcation message <br>
d The text of Incoming links pointing to this document <br>
(e.g. &lt;a
href=&quot;docURL&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;) <br>
A Anchors in the document (i.e. &lt;A NAME=...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username:password <br>
Tells htdig to send the supplied username and password with
each HTTP request. The credentials will be encoded using the
&Acirc;&acute;Basic&Acirc;&acute; authentication method.
There HAS to be a <br>
colon (:) between the username and password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. This increases
the verbosity of the program. Using more than 2 is probably
only useful for debugging purposes. The default verbose mode
(using only one -v) <br>
gives a nice progress report while digging. Please consult
the section below on the exact format of the progress
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT OF THE PROGRESS REPORT
GIVEN IN VERBOSE MODE <br>
A line is shown for each URL, with 3 numbers before the URL
and some symbols after the URL. The first number is the
number of documents parsed so far, the second is the <br>
DocID for this document, and the third is the hop count of
the document (number of hops from one of the start_url
documents). Signification of the symbols printed after <br>
the url:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*&quot; is printed for a
link already visited</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;+&quot; is printed for a
new link just queued</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-&quot; is output for a
link rejected for any of a number of reasons. To find out
what those reasons are, you need to run htdig with at least
3 -v options, i.e. -vvv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are no &quot;*&quot;,
&quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; symbols after the URL, it
doesn&rsquo;t mean the document was not parsed or was empty,
but only that no links to other documents were found within
it. <br>
With more verbose output, these symbols will get
interspersed in several lines of debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/htdig/htdig.conf <br>
The default configuration file.</p>
