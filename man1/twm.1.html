<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
twm - Tab Window Manager for the X Window System</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
twm [ -display dpy ] [ -s ] [ -f initfile ] [ -v ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Twm is a window manager for the X Window System. It provides
titlebars, shaped windows, several forms of icon management,
user-defined macro functions, click-to-type and <br>
pointer-driven keyboard focus, and user-specified key and
pointer button bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is usually started
by the user&rsquo;s session manager or startup script. When
used from xdm(1) or xinit(1) without a session manager, twm
is frequently executed in the <br>
foreground as the last client. When run this way, exiting
twm causes the session to be terminated (i.e., logged
out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, application windows
are surrounded by a &lsquo;&lsquo;frame&rsquo;&rsquo; with a
titlebar at the top and a special border around the window.
The titlebar contains the window&rsquo;s name, a rec&acirc;
<br>
tangle that is lit when the window is receiving keyboard
input, and function boxes known as
&lsquo;&lsquo;titlebuttons&rsquo;&rsquo; at the left and
right edges of the titlebar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing pointer Button1
(usually the left-most button unless it has been changed
with xmodmap) on a titlebutton will invoke the function
associated with the button. In the <br>
default interface, windows are iconified by clicking
(pressing and then immediately releasing) the left
titlebutton (which looks like a Dot). Conversely, windows
are deiconified <br>
by clicking in the associated icon or entry in the icon
manager (see description of the variable ShowIconManager and
of the function f.showiconmgr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows are resized by pressing
the right titlebutton (which resembles a group of nested
squares), dragging the pointer over edge that is to be
moved, and releasing the pointer <br>
when the outline of the window is the desired size.
Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or
highlight region, dragging a window outline to the new
location, and <br>
then releasing when the outline is in the desired position.
Just clicking in the title or highlight region raises the
window without moving it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When new windows are created,
twm will honor any size and location information requested
by the user (usually through -geometry command line argument
or resources for the indi&acirc; <br>
vidual applications). Otherwise, an outline of the
window&rsquo;s default size, its titlebar, and lines
dividing the window into a 3x3 grid that track the pointer
are displayed. <br>
Clicking pointer Button1 will position the window at the
current position and give it the default size. Pressing
pointer Button2 (usually the middle pointer button) and
dragging <br>
the outline will give the window its current position but
allow the sides to be resized as described above. Clicking
pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer button) will give
<br>
the window its current position but attempt to make it long
enough to touch the bottom the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Twm accepts the following command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display dpy <br>
This option specifies the X server to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s This option indicates that
only the default screen (as specified by -display or by the
DISPLAY environment variable) should be managed. By default,
twm will attempt to <br>
manage all screens on the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
This option specifies the name of the startup file to use.
By default, twm will look in the user&rsquo;s home directory
for files named .twmrc.num (where num is a screen num&acirc;
<br>
ber) or .twmrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option indicates that
twm should print error messages whenever an unexpected X
Error event is received. This can be useful when debugging
applications but can be <br>
distracting in regular use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMIZATION <br>
Much of twm&rsquo;s appearance and behavior can be
controlled by providing a startup file in one of the
following locations (searched in order for each screen being
managed when twm <br>
begins):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.twmrc.screennumber <br>
The screennumber is a small positive number (e.g. 0, 1,
etc.) representing the screen number (e.g. the last number
in the DISPLAY environment variable host:dis&acirc; <br>
playnum.screennum) that would be used to contact that screen
of the display. This is intended for displays with multiple
screens of differing visual types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.twmrc <br>
This is the usual name for an individual user&rsquo;s
startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/X11/twm/system.twmrc
<br>
If neither of the preceding files are found, twm will look
in this file for a default configuration. This is often
tailored by the site administrator to provide conve&acirc;
<br>
nient menus or familiar bindings for novice users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no startup files are found,
twm will use the built-in defaults described above. The only
resource used by twm is bitmapFilePath for a colon-separated
list of directories to <br>
search when looking for bitmap files (for more information,
see the Athena Widgets manual and xrdb(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Twm startup files are logically
broken up into three types of specifications: Variables,
Bindings, Menus. The Variables section must come first and
is used to describe the <br>
fonts, colors, cursors, border widths, icon and window
placement, highlighting, autoraising, layout of titles,
warping, use of the icon manager. The Bindings section
usually <br>
comes second and is used to specify the functions that
should be to be invoked when keyboard and pointer buttons
are pressed in windows, icons, titles, and frames. The Menus
<br>
section gives any user-defined menus (containing functions
to be invoked or commands to be executed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable names and keywords are
case-insensitive. Strings must be surrounded by double quote
characters (e.g. &quot;blue&quot;) and are case-sensitive. A
pound sign (#) outside of a <br>
string causes the remainder of the line in which the
character appears to be treated as a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES <br>
Many of the aspects of twm&rsquo;s user interface are
controlled by variables that may be set in the user&rsquo;s
startup file. Some of the options are enabled or disabled
simply by the <br>
presence of a particular keyword. Other options require
keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of all of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists are surrounded by braces
and are usually separated by whitespace or a newline. For
example: <br>
AutoRaise { &quot;emacs&quot; &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;Xmh&quot; } <br>
or <br>
AutoRaise <br>
{ <br>
&quot;emacs&quot; <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; <br>
&quot;Xmh&quot; <br>
} <br>
When a variable containing a list of strings representing
windows is searched (e.g. to determine whether or not to
enable autoraise as shown above), a string must be an exact,
<br>
case-sensitive match to the window&rsquo;s name (given by
the WM_NAME window property), resource name or class name
(both given by the WM_CLASS window property). The preceding
example <br>
would enable autoraise on windows named
&lsquo;&lsquo;emacs&rsquo;&rsquo; as well as any xterm
(since they are of class &lsquo;&lsquo;XTerm&rsquo;&rsquo;)
or xmh windows (which are of class
&lsquo;&lsquo;Xmh&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String arguments that are
interpreted as filenames (see the Pixmaps, Cursors, and
IconDirectory below) will prepend the user&rsquo;s directory
(specified by the HOME environment vari&acirc; <br>
able) if the first character is a tilde (~). If, instead,
the first character is a colon (:), the name is assumed to
refer to one of the internal bitmaps that are used to create
<br>
the default titlebars symbols: :xlogo or :delete (both refer
to the X logo), :dot or :iconify (both refer to the dot),
:resize (the nested squares used by the resize button), <br>
:menu (a page with lines), and :question (the question mark
used for non-existent bitmap files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables may be
specified at the top of a twm startup file. Lists of Window
name prefix strings are indicated by win-list. Optional
arguments are shown in square <br>
brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRaise { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows that should
automatically be raised whenever the pointer enters the
window. This action can be interactively enabled or
dis&acirc; <br>
abled on individual windows using the function
f.autoraise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRelativeResize <br>
This variable indicates that dragging out a window size
(either when initially sizing the window with pointer
Button2 or when resizing it) should not wait until the <br>
pointer has crossed the window edges. Instead, moving the
pointer automatically causes the nearest edge or edges to
move by the same amount. This allows the resizing of <br>
windows that extend off the edge of the screen. If the
pointer is in the center of the window, or if the resize is
begun by pressing a titlebutton, twm will still wait <br>
for the pointer to cross a window edge (to prevent
accidents). This option is particularly useful for people
who like the press-drag-release method of sweeping out
win&acirc; <br>
dow sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderColor string [{
wincolorlist }] <br>
This variable specifies the default color of the border to
be placed around all non-iconified windows, and may only be
given within a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. <br>
The optional wincolorlist specifies a list of window and
color name pairs for specifying particular border colors for
different types of windows. For example: <br>
BorderColor &quot;gray50&quot; <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;red&quot; <br>
&quot;xmh&quot; &quot;green&quot; <br>
} <br>
The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderTileBackground string [{
wincolorlist }] <br>
This variable specifies the default background color in the
gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if
NoHighlight hasn&rsquo;t been set), and may only be given
within <br>
a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional
wincolorlist allows per-window colors to be specified. The
default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderTileForeground string [{
wincolorlist }] <br>
This variable specifies the default foreground color in the
gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if
NoHighlight hasn&rsquo;t been set), and may only be given
within <br>
a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional
wincolorlist allows per-window colors to be specified. The
default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderWidth pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding all client window frames if ClientBorderWidth
has not been specified. This value is also used to <br>
set the border size of windows created by twm (such as the
icon manager). The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonIndent pixels <br>
This variable specifies the amount by which titlebuttons
should be indented on all sides. Positive values cause the
buttons to be smaller than the window text and high&acirc;
<br>
light area so that they stand out. Setting this and the
TitleButtonBorderWidth variables to 0 makes titlebuttons be
as tall and wide as possible. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBorderWidth <br>
This variable indicates that border width of a
window&rsquo;s frame should be set to the initial border
width of the window, rather than to the value of
BorderWidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color { colors-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of color assignments to be
made if the default display is capable of displaying more
than simple black and white. The colors-list is made <br>
up of the following color variables and their values:
DefaultBackground, DefaultForeground, MenuBackground,
MenuForeground, MenuTitleBackground, MenuTitleForeground,
<br>
MenuShadowColor, MenuBorderColor, PointerForeground, and
PointerBackground. The following color variables may also be
given a list of window and color name pairs to <br>
allow per-window colors to be specified (see BorderColor for
details): BorderColor, IconManagerHighlight,
BorderTitleBackground, BorderTitleForeground,
TitleBackground, <br>
TitleForeground, IconBackground, IconForeground,
IconBorderColor, IconManagerBackground, and
IconManagerForeground. For example: <br>
Color <br>
{ <br>
MenuBackground &quot;gray50&quot; <br>
MenuForeground &quot;blue&quot; <br>
BorderColor &quot;red&quot; { &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;yellow&quot; } <br>
TitleForeground &quot;yellow&quot; <br>
TitleBackground &quot;blue&quot; <br>
} <br>
All of these color variables may also be specified for the
Monochrome variable, allowing the same initialization file
to be used on both color and monochrome displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConstrainedMoveTime milliseconds
<br>
This variable specifies the length of time between button
clicks needed to begin a constrained move operation. Double
clicking within this amount of time when invoking <br>
f.move will cause the window to be moved only in a
horizontal or vertical direction. Setting this value to 0
will disable constrained moves. The default is 400
mil&acirc; <br>
liseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursors { cursor-list } <br>
This variable specifies the glyphs that twm should use for
various pointer cursors. Each cursor may be defined either
from the cursor font or from two bitmap files. <br>
Shapes from the cursor font may be specified directly as:
<br>
cursorname &quot;string&quot; <br>
where cursorname is one of the cursor names listed below,
and string is the name of a glyph as found in the file
/usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h (without the
&lsquo;&lsquo;XC_&rsquo;&rsquo; pre&acirc; <br>
fix). If the cursor is to be defined from bitmap files, the
following syntax is used instead: <br>
cursorname &quot;image&quot; &quot;mask&quot; <br>
The image and mask strings specify the names of files
containing the glyph image and mask in bitmap(1) form. The
bitmap files are located in the same manner as icon
bit&acirc; <br>
map files. The following example shows the default cursor
definitions: <br>
Cursors <br>
{ <br>
Frame &quot;top_left_arrow&quot; <br>
Title &quot;top_left_arrow&quot; <br>
Icon &quot;top_left_arrow&quot; <br>
IconMgr &quot;top_left_arrow&quot; <br>
Move &quot;fleur&quot; <br>
Resize &quot;fleur&quot; <br>
Menu &quot;sb_left_arrow&quot; <br>
Button &quot;hand2&quot; <br>
Wait &quot;watch&quot; <br>
Select &quot;dot&quot; <br>
Destroy &quot;pirate&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DecorateTransients <br>
This variable indicates that transient windows (those
containing a WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property) should have
titlebars. By default, transients are not reparented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultBackground string <br>
This variable specifies the background color to be used for
sizing and information windows. The default is
&quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultForeground string <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color to be used for
sizing and information windows. The default is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontIconifyByUnmapping {
win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows that should not be
iconified by simply unmapping the window (as would be the
case if IconifyByUnmapping had been set). This is <br>
frequently used to force some windows to be treated as icons
while other windows are handled by the icon manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontMoveOff <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be allowed
to be moved off the screen. It can be overridden by the
f.forcemove function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontSqueezeTitle [{ win-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that titlebars should not be
squeezed to their minimum size as described under
SqueezeTitle below. If the optional window list is supplied,
only <br>
those windows will be prevented from being squeezed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ForceIcons <br>
This variable indicates that icon pixmaps specified in the
Icons variable should override any client-supplied
pixmaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FramePadding pixels <br>
This variable specifies the distance between the titlebar
decorations (the button and text) and the window frame. The
default is 2 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grayscale { colors } <br>
This variable specifies a list of color assignments that
should be made if the screen has a GrayScale default visual.
See the description of Colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBackground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the background color of icons, and
may only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or
Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a list of
win&acirc; <br>
dow names and colors so that per-window colors may be
specified. See the BorderColor variable for a complete
description of the win-list. The default is
&quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBorderColor string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the color of the border used for
icon windows, and may only be specified inside of a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional win-list <br>
is a list of window names and colors so that per-window
colors may be specified. See the BorderColor variable for a
complete description of the win-list. The default is <br>
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBorderWidth pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding icon windows. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconDirectory string <br>
This variable specifies the directory that should be
searched if if a bitmap file cannot be found in any of the
directories in the bitmapFilePath resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font to be used to display icon
names within icons. The default is &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconForeground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color to be used when
displaying icons, and may only be specified inside of a
Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional <br>
win-list is a list of window names and colors so that
per-window colors may be specified. See the BorderColor
variable for a complete description of the win-list. The
<br>
default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconifyByUnmapping [{ win-list
}] <br>
This variable indicates that windows should be iconified by
being unmapped without trying to map any icons. This assumes
that the user will remap the window through the <br>
icon manager, the f.warpto function, or the TwmWindows menu.
If the optional win-list is provided, only those windows
will be iconified by simply unmapping. Windows <br>
that have both this and the IconManagerDontShow options set
may not be accessible if no binding to the TwmWindows menu
is set in the user&rsquo;s startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerBackground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the background color to use for icon
manager entries, and may only be specified inside of a
Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional <br>
win-list is a list of window names and colors so that
per-window colors may be specified. See the BorderColor
variable for a complete description of the win-list. The
<br>
default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerDontShow [{ win-list
}] <br>
This variable indicates that the icon manager should not
display any windows. If the optional win-list is given, only
those windows will not be displayed. This variable <br>
is used to prevent windows that are rarely iconified (such
as xclock or xload) from taking up space in the icon
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font to be used when displaying
icon manager entries. The default is
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerForeground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color to be used when
displaying icon manager entries, and may only be specified
inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. <br>
The optional win-list is a list of window names and colors
so that per-window colors may be specified. See the
BorderColor variable for a complete description of the <br>
win-list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerGeometry string [
columns ] <br>
This variable specifies the geometry of the icon manager
window. The string argument is standard geometry
specification that indicates the initial full size of the
icon <br>
manager. The icon manager window is then broken into columns
pieces and scaled according to the number of entries in the
icon manager. Extra entries are wrapped to form <br>
additional rows. The default number of columns is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerHighlight string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the border color to be used when
highlighting the icon manager entry that currently has the
focus, and can only be specified inside of a Color, <br>
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a
list of window names and colors so that per-window colors
may be specified. See the BorderColor variable for a <br>
complete description of the win-list. The default is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagers { iconmgr-list }
<br>
This variable specifies a list of icon managers to create.
Each item in the iconmgr-list has the following format: <br>
&quot;winname&quot; [&quot;iconname&quot;]
&quot;geometry&quot; columns <br>
where winname is the name of the windows that should be put
into this icon manager, iconname is the name of that icon
manager window&rsquo;s icon, geometry is a standard
geome&acirc; <br>
try specification, and columns is the number of columns in
this icon manager as described in IconManagerGeometry. For
example: <br>
IconManagers <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;=300x5+800+5&quot; 5 <br>
&quot;myhost&quot; &quot;=400x5+100+5&quot; 2 <br>
} <br>
Clients whose name or class is
&lsquo;&lsquo;XTerm&rsquo;&rsquo; will have an entry created
in the &lsquo;&lsquo;XTerm&rsquo;&rsquo; icon manager.
Clients whose name was &lsquo;&lsquo;myhost&rsquo;&rsquo;
would be put into the &lsquo;&lsquo;myhost&rsquo;&rsquo;
<br>
icon manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerShow { win-list }
<br>
This variable specifies a list of windows that should appear
in the icon manager. When used in conjunction with the
IconManagerDontShow variable, only the windows in <br>
this list will be shown in the icon manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconRegion geomstring vgrav
hgrav gridwidth gridheight <br>
This variable specifies an area on the root window in which
icons are placed if no specific icon location is provided by
the client. The geomstring is a quoted string <br>
containing a standard geometry specification. If more than
one IconRegion lines are given, icons will be put into the
succeeding icon regions when the first is full. <br>
The vgrav argument should be either North or South and
control and is used to control whether icons are first
filled in from the top or bottom of the icon region.
Simi&acirc; <br>
larly, the hgrav argument should be either East or West and
is used to control whether icons should be filled in from
left from the right. Icons are laid out within the <br>
region in a grid with cells gridwidth pixels wide and
gridheight pixels high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of window names and the
bitmap filenames that should be used as their icons. For
example: <br>
Icons <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;xterm.icon&quot; <br>
&quot;xfd&quot; &quot;xfd_icon&quot; <br>
} <br>
Windows that match &lsquo;&lsquo;XTerm&rsquo;&rsquo; and
would not be iconified by unmapping, and would try to use
the icon bitmap in the file
&lsquo;&lsquo;xterm.icon&rsquo;&rsquo;. If ForceIcons is
specified, this <br>
bitmap will be used even if the client has requested its own
icon pixmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InterpolateMenuColors <br>
This variable indicates that menu entry colors should be
interpolated between entry specified colors. In the example
below: <br>
Menu &quot;mymenu&quot; <br>
{ <br>
&quot;Title&quot; (&quot;black&quot;:&quot;red&quot;)
f.title <br>
&quot;entry1&quot; f.nop <br>
&quot;entry2&quot; f.nop <br>
&quot;entry3&quot; (&quot;white&quot;:&quot;green&quot;)
f.nop <br>
&quot;entry4&quot; f.nop <br>
&quot;entry5&quot; (&quot;red&quot;:&quot;white&quot;) f.nop
<br>
} <br>
the foreground colors for &lsquo;&lsquo;entry1&rsquo;&rsquo;
and &lsquo;&lsquo;entry2&rsquo;&rsquo; will be interpolated
between black and white, and the background colors between
red and green. Similarly, the fore&acirc; <br>
ground for &lsquo;&lsquo;entry4&rsquo;&rsquo; will be
half-way between white and red, and the background will be
half-way between green and white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MakeTitle { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows on which a
titlebar should be placed and is used to request titles on
specific windows when NoTitle has been set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxWindowSize string <br>
This variable specifies a geometry in which the width and
height give the maximum size for a given window. This is
typically used to restrict windows to the size of the <br>
screen. The default width is 32767 - screen width. The
default height is 32767 - screen height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuBackground string <br>
This variable specifies the background color used for menus,
and can only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome
list. The default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuBorderColor string <br>
This variable specifies the color of the menu border and can
only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome
list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuBorderWidth pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding menu windows. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font to use when displaying
menus. The default is &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuForeground string <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color used for menus,
and can only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or
Monochrome list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuShadowColor string <br>
This variable specifies the color of the shadow behind
pull-down menus and can only be specified inside of a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The default is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuTitleBackground string <br>
This variable specifies the background color for f.title
entries in menus, and can only be specified inside of a
Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The default is <br>
&quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuTitleForeground string <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color for f.title
entries in menus and can only be specified inside of a Color
or Monochrome list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Monochrome { colors } <br>
This variable specifies a list of color assignments that
should be made if the screen has a depth of 1. See the
description of Colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveDelta pixels <br>
This variable specifies the number of pixels the pointer
must move before the f.move function starts working. Also
see the f.deltastop function. The default is zero <br>
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoBackingStore <br>
This variable indicates that twm&rsquo;s menus should not
request backing store to minimize repainting of menus. This
is typically used with servers that can repaint faster <br>
than they can handle backing store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoCaseSensitive <br>
This variable indicates that case should be ignored when
sorting icon names in an icon manager. This option is
typically used with applications that capitalize the first
<br>
letter of their icon name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoDefaults <br>
This variable indicates that twm should not supply the
default titlebuttons and bindings. This option should only
be used if the startup file contains a completely new <br>
set of bindings and definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoGrabServer <br>
This variable indicates that twm should not grab the server
when popping up menus and moving opaque windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoHighlight [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that borders should not be
highlighted to track the location of the pointer. If the
optional win-list is given, highlighting will only be
dis&acirc; <br>
abled for those windows. When the border is highlighted, it
will be drawn in the current BorderColor. When the border is
not highlighted, it will be stippled with a <br>
gray pattern using the current BorderTileForeground and
BorderTileBackground colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoIconManagers <br>
This variable indicates that no icon manager should be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoMenuShadows <br>
This variable indicates that menus should not have drop
shadows drawn behind them. This is typically used with
slower servers since it speeds up menu drawing at the <br>
expense of making the menu slightly harder to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnDeiconify <br>
This variable indicates that windows that are deiconified
should not be raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnMove <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be raised
when moved. This is typically used to allow windows to slide
underneath each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnResize <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be raised
when resized. This is typically used to allow windows to be
resized underneath each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnWarp <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be raised
when the pointer is warped into them with the f.warpto
function. If this option is set, warping to an occluded <br>
window may result in the pointer ending up in the occluding
window instead the desired window (which causes unexpected
behavior with f.warpring).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoSaveUnders <br>
This variable indicates that menus should not request
save-unders to minimize window repainting following menu
selection. It is typically used with displays that can <br>
repaint faster than they can handle save-unders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoStackMode [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that client window requests to
change stacking order should be ignored. If the optional
win-list is given, only requests on those windows will be
<br>
ignored. This is typically used to prevent applications from
relentlessly popping themselves to the front of the window
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitle [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not have
titlebars. If the optional win-list is given, only those
windows will not have titlebars. MakeTitle may be used <br>
with this option to force titlebars to be put on specific
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitleFocus <br>
This variable indicates that twm should not set keyboard
input focus to each window as it is entered. Normally, twm
sets the focus so that focus and key events from the <br>
titlebar and icon managers are delivered to the application.
If the pointer is moved quickly and twm is slow to respond,
input can be directed to the old window instead <br>
of the new. This option is typically used to prevent this
&lsquo;&lsquo;input lag&rsquo;&rsquo; and to work around
bugs in older applications that have problems with focus
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitleHighlight [{ win-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that the highlight area of the
titlebar, which is used to indicate the window that
currently has the input focus, should not be displayed. If
the <br>
optional win-list is given, only those windows will not have
highlight areas. This and the SqueezeTitle options can be
set to substantially reduce the amount of screen <br>
space required by titlebars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMove <br>
This variable indicates that the f.move function should
actually move the window instead of just an outline so that
the user can immediately see what the window will look <br>
like in the new position. This option is typically used on
fast displays (particularly if NoGrabServer is set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pixmaps { pixmaps } <br>
This variable specifies a list of pixmaps that define the
appearance of various images. Each entry is a keyword
indicating the pixmap to set, followed by a string giving
<br>
the name of the bitmap file. The following pixmaps may be
specified: <br>
Pixmaps <br>
{ <br>
TitleHighlight &quot;gray1&quot; <br>
} <br>
The default for TitleHighlight is to use an even stipple
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Priority priority <br>
This variable sets twm&rsquo;s priority. priority should be
an unquoted, signed number (e.g. 999). This variable has an
effect only if the server supports the SYNC extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RandomPlacement <br>
This variable indicates that windows with no specified
geometry should be placed in a pseudo-random location
instead of having the user drag out an outline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font to be used for in the
dimensions window when resizing windows. The default is
&quot;fixed&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RestartPreviousState <br>
This variable indicates that twm should attempt to use the
WM_STATE property on client windows to tell which windows
should be iconified and which should be left visible. <br>
This is typically used to try to regenerate the state that
the screen was in before the previous window manager was
shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveColor { colors-list } <br>
This variable indicates a list of color assignments to be
stored as pixel values in the root window property
_MIT_PRIORITY_COLORS. Clients may elect to preserve these
<br>
values when installing their own colormap. Note that use of
this mechanism is a way an for application to avoid the
&quot;technicolor&quot; problem, whereby useful screen
objects <br>
such as window borders and titlebars disappear when a
programs custom colors are installed by the window manager.
For example: <br>
SaveColor <br>
{ <br>
BorderColor <br>
TitleBackground <br>
TitleForeground <br>
&quot;red&quot; <br>
&quot;green&quot; <br>
&quot;blue&quot; <br>
} <br>
This would place on the root window 3 pixel values for
borders and titlebars, as well as the three color strings,
all taken from the default colormap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShowIconManager <br>
This variable indicates that the icon manager window should
be displayed when twm is started. It can always be brought
up using the f.showiconmgr function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SortIconManager <br>
This variable indicates that entries in the icon manager
should be sorted alphabetically rather than by simply
appending new windows to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SqueezeTitle [{ squeeze-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that twm should attempt to use the
SHAPE extension to make titlebars occupy only as much screen
space as they need, rather than extending all the <br>
way across the top of the window. The optional squeeze-list
may be used to control the location of the squeezed titlebar
along the top of the window. It contains <br>
entries of the form: <br>
&quot;name&quot; justification num denom <br>
where name is a window name, justification is either left,
center, or right, and num and denom are numbers specifying a
ratio giving the relative position about which the <br>
titlebar is justified. The ratio is measured from left to
right if the numerator is positive, and right to left if
negative. A denominator of 0 indicates that the <br>
numerator should be measured in pixels. For convenience, the
ratio 0/0 is the same as 1/2 for center and -1/1 for right.
For example: <br>
SqueezeTitle <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; left 0 0 <br>
&quot;xterm1&quot; left 1 3 <br>
&quot;xterm2&quot; left 2 3 <br>
&quot;oclock&quot; center 0 0 <br>
&quot;emacs&quot; right 0 0 <br>
} <br>
The DontSqueezeTitle list can be used to turn off squeezing
on certain titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartIconified [{ win-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that client windows should initially
be left as icons until explicitly deiconified by the user.
If the optional win-list is given, only those <br>
windows will be started iconic. This is useful for programs
that do not support an -iconic command line option or
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleBackground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the background color used in
titlebars, and may only be specified inside of a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a
<br>
list of window names and colors so that per-window colors
may be specified. The default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleButtonBorderWidth pixels
<br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding titlebuttons. This is typically set to 0 to
allow titlebuttons to take up as much space as possible <br>
and to not have a border. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font to be used for displaying
window names in titlebars. The default is
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleForeground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color used in
titlebars, and may only be specified inside of a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a
<br>
list of window names and colors so that per-window colors
may be specified. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitlePadding pixels <br>
This variable specifies the distance between the various
buttons, text, and highlight areas in the titlebar. The
default is 8 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UnknownIcon string <br>
This variable specifies the filename of a bitmap file to be
used as the default icon. This bitmap will be used as the
icon of all clients which do not provide an icon <br>
bitmap and are not listed in the Icons list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UsePPosition string <br>
This variable specifies whether or not twm should honor
program-requested locations (given by the PPosition flag in
the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property) in the absence of a <br>
user-specified position. The argument string may have one of
three values: &quot;off&quot; (the default) indicating that
twm should ignore the program-supplied position,
&quot;on&quot; <br>
indicating that the position should be used, and
&quot;non-zero&quot; indicating that the position should
used if it is other than (0,0). The latter option is for
working around a <br>
bug in older toolkits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpCursor [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped
into windows when they are deiconified. If the optional
win-list is given, the pointer will only be warped when <br>
those windows are deiconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowRing { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows along which the
f.warpring function cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpUnmapped <br>
This variable indicates that the f.warpto function should
deiconify any iconified windows it encounters. This is
typically used to make a key binding that will pop a <br>
particular window (such as xmh), no matter where it is. The
default is for f.warpto to ignore iconified windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XorValue number <br>
This variable specifies the value to use when drawing window
outlines for moving and resizing. This should be set to a
value that will result in a variety of of distin&acirc; <br>
guishable colors when exclusive-or&rsquo;ed with the
contents of the user&rsquo;s typical screen. Setting this
variable to 1 often gives nice results if adjacent colors in
the <br>
default colormap are distinct. By default, twm will attempt
to cause temporary lines to appear at the opposite end of
the colormap from the graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom [ count ] <br>
This variable indicates that outlines suggesting movement of
a window to and from its iconified state should be displayed
whenever a window is iconified or deiconified. <br>
The optional count argument specifies the number of outlines
to be drawn. The default count is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables must be
set after the fonts have been assigned, so it is usually
best to put them at the end of the variables or beginning of
the bindings sections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DefaultFunction function <br>
This variable specifies the function to be executed when a
key or button event is received for which no binding is
provided. This is typically bound to f.nop, f.beep, or <br>
a menu containing window operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowFunction function <br>
This variable specifies the function to execute when a
window is selected from the TwmWindows menu. If this
variable is not set, the window will be deiconified and <br>
raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINDINGS <br>
After the desired variables have been set, functions may be
attached titlebuttons and key and pointer buttons.
Titlebuttons may be added from the left or right side and
appear <br>
in the titlebar from left-to-right according to the order in
which they are specified. Key and pointer button bindings
may be given in any order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Titlebuttons specifications must
include the name of the pixmap to use in the button box and
the function to be invoked when a pointer button is pressed
within them: <br>
LeftTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; = function <br>
or <br>
RightTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; = function <br>
The bitmapname may refer to one of the built-in bitmaps
(which are scaled to match TitleFont) by using the
appropriate colon-prefixed name described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key and pointer button
specifications must give the modifiers that must be pressed,
over which parts of the screen the pointer must be, and what
function is to be invoked. Keys <br>
are given as strings containing the appropriate keysym name;
buttons are given as the keywords Button1-Button5: <br>
&quot;FP1&quot; = modlist : context : function <br>
Button1 = modlist : context : function <br>
The modlist is any combination of the modifier names shift,
control, lock, meta, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, or mod5 (which
may be abbreviated as s, c, l, m, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, <br>
respectively) separated by a vertical bar (|). Similarly,
the context is any combination of window, title, icon, root,
frame, iconmgr, their first letters (iconmgr abbreviation
<br>
is m), or all, separated by a vertical bar. The function is
any of the f. keywords described below. For example, the
default startup file contains the following bindings: <br>
Button1 = : root : f.menu &quot;TwmWindows&quot; <br>
Button1 = m : window | icon : f.function
&quot;move-or-lower&quot; <br>
Button2 = m : window | icon : f.iconify <br>
Button3 = m : window | icon : f.function
&quot;move-or-raise&quot; <br>
Button1 = : title : f.function &quot;move-or-raise&quot;
<br>
Button2 = : title : f.raiselower <br>
Button1 = : icon : f.function &quot;move-or-iconify&quot;
<br>
Button2 = : icon : f.iconify <br>
Button1 = : iconmgr : f.iconify <br>
Button2 = : iconmgr : f.iconify <br>
A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows from the
keyboard could use the following bindings: <br>
&quot;F1&quot; = : all : f.iconify <br>
&quot;F2&quot; = : all : f.raiselower <br>
&quot;F3&quot; = : all : f.warpring &quot;next&quot; <br>
&quot;F4&quot; = : all : f.warpto &quot;xmh&quot; <br>
&quot;F5&quot; = : all : f.warpto &quot;emacs&quot; <br>
&quot;F6&quot; = : all : f.colormap &quot;next&quot; <br>
&quot;F7&quot; = : all : f.colormap &quot;default&quot; <br>
&quot;F20&quot; = : all : f.warptoscreen &quot;next&quot;
<br>
&quot;Left&quot; = m : all : f.backiconmgr <br>
&quot;Right&quot; = m | s : all : f.forwiconmgr <br>
&quot;Up&quot; = m : all : f.upiconmgr <br>
&quot;Down&quot; = m | s : all : f.downiconmgr <br>
Twm provides many more window manipulation primitives than
can be conveniently stored in a titlebar, menu, or set of
key bindings. Although a small set of defaults are supplied
<br>
(unless the NoDefaults is specified), most users will want
to have their most common operations bound to key and button
strokes. To do this, twm associates names with each of <br>
the primitives and provides user-defined functions for
building higher level primitives and menus for interactively
selecting among groups of functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User-defined functions contain
the name by which they are referenced in calls to f.function
and a list of other functions to execute. For example: <br>
Function &quot;move-or-lower&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.lower } <br>
Function &quot;move-or-raise&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.raise } <br>
Function &quot;move-or-iconify&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.iconify } <br>
Function &quot;restore-colormap&quot; { f.colormap
&quot;default&quot; f.lower } <br>
The function name must be used in f.function exactly as it
appears in the function specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the descriptions below, if
the function is said to operate on the selected window, but
is invoked from a root menu, the cursor will be changed to
the Select cursor and the <br>
next window to receive a button press will be chosen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! string <br>
This is an abbreviation for f.exec string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.autoraise <br>
This function toggles whether or not the selected window is
raised whenever entered by the pointer. See the description
of the variable AutoRaise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.backiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the previous column in
the current icon manager, wrapping back to the previous row
if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.beep This function sounds the
keyboard bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.bottomzoom <br>
This function is similar to the f.fullzoom function, but
resizes the window to fill only the bottom half of the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.circledown <br>
This function lowers the top-most window that occludes
another window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.circleup <br>
This function raises the bottom-most window that is occluded
by another window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.colormap string <br>
This function rotates the colormaps (obtained from the
WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the window) that twm will
display when the pointer is in this window. The argument
<br>
string may have one of the following values:
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;prev&quot;, and &quot;default&quot;.
It should be noted here that in general, the installed
colormap is determined by keyboard <br>
focus. A pointer driven keyboard focus will install a
private colormap upon entry of the window owning the
colormap. Using the click to type model, private colormaps
<br>
will not be installed until the user presses a mouse button
on the target window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.deiconify <br>
This function deiconifies the selected window. If the window
is not an icon, this function does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.delete <br>
This function sends the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message to the
selected window if the client application has requested it
through the WM_PROTOCOLS window property. The applica&acirc;
<br>
tion is supposed to respond to the message by removing the
indicated window. If the window has not requested
WM_DELETE_WINDOW messages, the keyboard bell will be rung
<br>
indicating that the user should choose an alternative
method. Note this is very different from f.destroy. The
intent here is to delete a single window, not necessarily
<br>
the entire application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.deltastop <br>
This function allows a user-defined function to be aborted
if the pointer has been moved more than MoveDelta pixels.
See the example definition given for Function &quot;move-
<br>
or-raise&quot; at the beginning of the section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.destroy <br>
This function instructs the X server to close the display
connection of the client that created the selected window.
This should only be used as a last resort for shut&acirc;
<br>
ting down runaway clients. See also f.delete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.downiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the next row in the
current icon manger, wrapping to the beginning of the next
column if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.exec string <br>
This function passes the argument string to /bin/sh for
execution. In multiscreen mode, if string starts a new X
client without giving a display argument, the client <br>
will appear on the screen from which this function was
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.focus This function toggles
the keyboard focus of the server to the selected window,
changing the focus rule from pointer-driven if necessary. If
the selected window already <br>
was focused, this function executes an f.unfocus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.forcemove <br>
This function is like f.move except that it ignores the
DontMoveOff variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.forwiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the next column in the
current icon manager, wrapping to the beginning of the next
row if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.fullzoom <br>
This function resizes the selected window to the full size
of the display or else restores the original size if the
window was already zoomed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.function string <br>
This function executes the user-defined function whose name
is specified by the argument string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hbzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.bottomzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hideiconmgr <br>
This function unmaps the current icon manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.horizoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.zoom function except that
the selected window is resized to the full width of the
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.htzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.topzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hzoom This function is a
synonym for f.horizoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.iconify <br>
This function iconifies or deiconifies the selected window
or icon, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.identify <br>
This function displays a summary of the name and geometry of
the selected window. If the server supports the SYNC
extension, the priority of the client owning the window <br>
is also displayed. Clicking the pointer or pressing a key in
the window will dismiss it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lefticonmgr <br>
This function similar to f.backiconmgr except that wrapping
does not change rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.leftzoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function but
causes the selected window is only resized to the left half
of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lower This function lowers the
selected window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.menu string <br>
This function invokes the menu specified by the argument
string. Cascaded menus may be built by nesting calls to
f.menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.move This function drags an
outline of the selected window (or the window itself if the
OpaqueMove variable is set) until the invoking pointer
button is released. Double <br>
clicking within the number of milliseconds given by
ConstrainedMoveTime warps the pointer to the center of the
window and constrains the move to be either horizontal or
<br>
vertical depending on which grid line is crossed. To abort a
move, press another button before releasing the first
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.nexticonmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the next icon manager
containing any windows on the current or any succeeding
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.nop This function does nothing
and is typically used with the DefaultFunction or
WindowFunction variables or to introduce blank lines in
menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.previconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the previous icon manager
containing any windows on the current or preceding
screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.priority string <br>
This function sets the priority of the client owning the
selected window to the numeric value of the argument string,
which should be a signed integer in double quotes <br>
(e.g. &quot;999&quot; ). This function has an effect only if
the server supports the SYNC extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.quit This function causes twm
to restore the window&rsquo;s borders and exit. If twm is
the first client invoked from xdm, this will result in a
server reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.raise This function raises the
selected window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.raiselower <br>
This function raises the selected window to the top of the
stacking order if it is occluded by any windows, otherwise
the window will be lowered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.refresh <br>
This function causes all windows to be refreshed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.resize <br>
This function displays an outline of the selected window.
Crossing a border (or setting AutoRelativeResize) will cause
the outline to begin to rubber band until the <br>
invoking button is released. To abort a resize, press
another button before releasing the first button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.restart <br>
This function kills and restarts twm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.startwm string <br>
This function kills twm and starts another window manager,
as specified by string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.righticonmgr <br>
This function is similar to f.nexticonmgr except that
wrapping does not change rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.rightzoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function except
that the selected window is only resized to the right half
of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.saveyourself <br>
This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF message to the
selected window if it has requested the message in its
WM_PROTOCOLS window property. Clients that accept this
mes&acirc; <br>
sage are supposed to checkpoint all state associated with
the window and update the WM_COMMAND property as specified
in the ICCCM. If the selected window has not <br>
selected for this message, the keyboard bell will be
rung.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.showiconmgr <br>
This function maps the current icon manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.sorticonmgr <br>
This function sorts the entries in the current icon manager
alphabetically. See the variable SortIconManager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.title This function provides a
centered, unselectable item in a menu definition. It should
not be used in any other context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.topzoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function except
that the selected window is only resized to the top half of
the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.unfocus <br>
This function resets the focus back to pointer-driven. This
should be used when a focused window is no longer
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.upiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the previous row in the
current icon manager, wrapping to the last row in the same
column if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.vlzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.leftzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.vrzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.rightzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warpring string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the next or previous
window (as indicated by the argument string, which may be
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;prev&quot;) specified in the
WindowRing variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warpto string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the window which has a
name or class that matches string. If the window is
iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable
WarpUn&acirc; <br>
mapped is set or else ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warptoiconmgr string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the icon manager entry
associated with the window containing the pointer in the
icon manager specified by the argument string. If <br>
string is empty (i.e. &quot;&quot;), the current icon
manager is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warptoscreen string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the screen specified by
the argument string. String may be a number (e.g.
&quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;), the word &quot;next&quot;
(indicating the current screen <br>
plus 1, skipping over any unmanaged screens), the word
&quot;back&quot; (indicating the current screen minus 1,
skipping over any unmanaged screens), or the word
&quot;prev&quot; (indicating <br>
the last screen visited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.winrefresh <br>
This function is similar to the f.refresh function except
that only the selected window is refreshed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.zoom This function is similar
to the f.fullzoom function, except that the only the height
of the selected window is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS <br>
Functions may be grouped and interactively selected using
pop-up (when bound to a pointer button) or pull-down (when
associated with a titlebutton) menus. Each menu
specifica&acirc; <br>
tion contains the name of the menu as it will be referred to
by f.menu, optional default foreground and background
colors, the list of item names and the functions they should
<br>
invoke, and optional foreground and background colors for
individual items: <br>
Menu &quot;menuname&quot; [
(&quot;deffore&quot;:&quot;defback&quot;) ] <br>
{ <br>
string1 [ (&quot;fore1&quot;:&quot;backn&quot;)] function1
<br>
string2 [ (&quot;fore2&quot;:&quot;backn&quot;)] function2
<br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
stringN [ (&quot;foreN&quot;:&quot;backN&quot;)] functionN
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The menuname is case-sensitive.
The optional deffore and defback arguments specify the
foreground and background colors used on a color display to
highlight menu entries. The <br>
string portion of each menu entry will be the text which
will appear in the menu. The optional fore and back
arguments specify the foreground and background colors of
the menu <br>
entry when the pointer is not in the entry. These colors
will only be used on a color display. The default is to use
the colors specified by the MenuForeground and
MenuBack&acirc; <br>
ground variables. The function portion of the menu entry is
one of the functions, including any user-defined functions,
or additional menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a special menu named
TwmWindows which contains the names of all of the client and
twm-supplied windows. Selecting an entry will cause the
WindowFunction to be executed <br>
on that window. If WindowFunction hasn&rsquo;t been set, the
window will be deiconified and raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICONS <br>
Twm supports several different ways of manipulating
iconified windows. The common pixmap-and-text style may be
laid out by hand or automatically arranged as described by
the <br>
IconRegion variable. In addition, a terse grid of icon
names, called an icon manager, provides a more efficient use
of screen space as well as the ability to navigate among
win&acirc; <br>
dows from the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An icon manager is a window that
contains names of selected or all windows currently on the
display. In addition to the window name, a small button
using the default iconify <br>
symbol will be displayed to the left of the name when the
window is iconified. By default, clicking on an entry in the
icon manager performs f.iconify. To change the actions <br>
taken in the icon manager, use the the iconmgr context when
specifying button and keyboard bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moving the pointer into the icon
manager also directs keyboard focus to the indicated window
(setting the focus explicitly or else sending synthetic
events NoTitleFocus is set). <br>
Using the f.upiconmgr, f.downiconmgr f.lefticonmgr, and
f.righticonmgr functions, the input focus can be changed
between windows directly from the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The resource manager should have been used instead of all of
the window lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IconRegion variable should
take a list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double clicking very fast to get
the constrained move function will sometimes cause the
window to move, even though the pointer is not moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If IconifyByUnmapping is on and
windows are listed in IconManagerDontShow but not in
DontIconifyByUnmapping, they may be lost if they are
iconified and no bindings to f.menu <br>
&quot;TwmWindows&quot; or f.warpto are setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DISPLAY This variable is used to determine which X server to
use. It is also set during f.exec so that programs come up
on the proper screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME This variable is used as
the prefix for files that begin with a tilde and for
locating the twm startup file.</p>
