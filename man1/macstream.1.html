<p>MACSTREAM(1) General Commands Manual MACSTREAM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
macstream - Convert a series of files to a MacBinary
stream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
macstream [ - options ] files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
macstream takes the files specified in files and combines
them to a MacBinary stream on standard output subject to the
options specified. If files also specifies directories <br>
they are followed recursively, and all files found will be
put in the MacBinary stream, together with directory
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In the absence of any options, macstream takes the specified
files and silently combines them to a MacBinary stream,
writing the result to standard output. Directories named in
<br>
files are followed recursively, all files found will be put
in the MacBinary stream, together with directory
information. Files are assumed to be in MacBinary format.
However, <br>
if the filename ends with .info the file is assumed to be
the info fork of a MacIntosh file split amongst more than
one file. In that case the files with .data and .rsrc
exten&acirc; <br>
sion are also read (if present). Also, if the info fork is
mentioned in the parameter list, the names of data and
resource forks can also be mentioned, but those will be
ignored <br>
(this is to allow wild-card expansion by the shell.)
Further, if some form of AppleShare is supported by the
installed program, and if the current directory, or one of
the <br>
directories found during recursive processing, is a
directory in the format of the supported version of
AppleShare, those files will be handled according to the
properties of <br>
AppleShare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r No intelligent
file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to
be plain resource files, and are written as MacIntosh
resource files with creator &quot;RSED&quot; and <br>
type &quot;RSRC&quot;, unless another creator and/or type
are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d No intelligent
file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to
be plain data files, and are written as MacIntosh data files
with creator &quot;MACA&quot; and type <br>
&quot;TEXT&quot;, unless another creator and/or type are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u As -d, but the codes for CR
and LF are interchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Is a synonym for -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c creator <br>
Defines the creator name to be used if one of the previous
options is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous
options is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List every file and directory
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Do not output files, give
information only (implies -l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Ask the user for every
file/directory whether it should be visited (implies
-l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Gives the patchlevel of the
program, and other information. Other options are ignored
and the program quits immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Give short information about
the options. Other options are ignored and the program quits
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As this is a beta release, there may still be some
problems.</p>
