<p>DJVUSED(1) DjVuLibre-3.5 DJVUSED(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
djvused - Multi-purpose DjVu document editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
djvused [options] djvufile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Program djvused is a powerful command line tool for
manipulating multi-page documents, creating or editing
annotation chunks, creating or editing hidden text layers,
pre-comput&acirc; <br>
ing thumbnail images, and more. The program first reads the
DjVu document djvufile and executes a number of djvused
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Djvused commands can be read
from a specific file (when option -f is specified), read
from the command line (when option -e is specified), or read
from the standard input (the <br>
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Cause djvused to print a command line prompt before
reading commands and a brief message describing how each
command was executed. This option is very useful for
debug&acirc; <br>
ging djvused scripts and also for interactively entering
djvused commands on the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f scriptfile <br>
Cause djvused to read commands from file scriptfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command <br>
Cause djvused to execute the commands specified by the
option argument commands. It is advisable to surround the
djvused commands by single quotes in order to prevent <br>
unwanted shell expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Cause djvused to save the
file djvufile after executing the specified commands. This
is similar to executing command save immediately before
terminating the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Cause djvused to print hidden
text and annotations as UTF-8 instead of encoding non-ASCII
characters with octal escape sequences for maximal
portability. This option is <br>
convenient for manually editing or viewing the djvused
output. This option also causes the emission of an UTF-8 BOM
under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Cause djvused to disregard
save commands. This is useful for debugging djvused scripts
without overwriting files on your disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVUSED EXAMPLES <br>
There are many ways to use program djvused. The following
examples illustrate some common uses of this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obtaining the size of a page
<br>
Command size outputs the width and height of the selected
pages using a HTML friendly syntax. For instance, the
following command prints the size of page 3 of document <br>
myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;select 3; size&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting the hidden text <br>
Command print-pure-txt outputs the text associated with a
page or a document. For instance, the following shell
command outputs the text for the entire document. Lines and
<br>
pages are delimited by the usual control characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;print-pure-txt&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command print-txt produces a
more extensive output describing the structure and the
location of the text components. The syntax of this output
is described later in this man <br>
page. For instance, the following shell command outputs
extended text information for page 3 of document
myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;select 3; print-txt&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting the annotations <br>
Annotation data can be extracted using command print-ant.
The syntax of the annotation data is described later in this
man page. For instance, the following shell command
out&acirc; <br>
puts the annotation data for the first page of document
myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;select 1; print-ant&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command print-ant only prints
the annotations stored in the selected component file.
Command print-merged-ant also retrieves annotations from all
the component files referenced <br>
by the current page (using INCL chunks) and prints the
merged information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping/restoring annotations
and text <br>
Three commands, output-txt, output-ant, and output-all,
produce djvused scripts. For instance, the following shell
command produces a djvused script, myfile.dsed, that
recreates <br>
all the text and annotation data in document
myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;output-all&rsquo; &gt; myfile.dsed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script myfile.dsed is a text
file that can be easily edited. The following shell command
then recreates the text and annotation information in file
myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -f
myfile.dsed -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting a page <br>
Both commands save-page and save-page-with create a DjVu
file representing the selected component file of a document.
The following shell command, for instance, creates a file
<br>
p05.djvu containing page 5 of document myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;select 5; save-page p05.djvu&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each page of a document might
import data from another component file using the so-called
inclusion ( INCL ) chunks. Command save-page then produces a
file with unresolved ref&acirc; <br>
erences to imported data. Such a file should then be made
part of a multi-page document containing the required data
in other component files. On the other hand, command save-
<br>
page-with copies all the imported data into the output file.
This file is directly usable. Yet collecting several such
files into a multi-page document might lead to useless <br>
data replication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pre-computing thumbnails <br>
Commands set-thumbnails constructs thumbnails that can be
later displayed by DjVu viewers. The following shell
command, for instance, computes thumbnails of size 64x64
pixels <br>
for all pages of file myfile.djvu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused myfile.djvu -e
&rsquo;set-thumbnails 64&rsquo; -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVUSED COMMANDS <br>
Command lines might contain zero, one, or more djvused
commands and an optional comment. Multiple djvused commands
must be separated by a semicolon character &rsquo;;&rsquo;.
Comments are <br>
introduced by the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character and extend until
the end of the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selection commands <br>
Multi-page DjVu documents are composed of a number of
component files. Most component files describe a specific
page of a document. Some component files contain information
<br>
shared by several pages such as shared image data, shared
annotations or thumbnails. Many djvused commands operate on
selected component files. All component files are ini&acirc;
<br>
tially selected. The following commands are useful for
changing the selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Print the total number of
pages in the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls List all component files in
the document. Each line contains an optional page number, a
letter describing the component file type, the size of the
component file, and <br>
identifier of the component file. Component file type
letters P, I, A, and T respectively stand for page data,
shared image data, shared annotation data, and thumbnail
<br>
data. Page numbers are only listed for component files
containing page data. When it is set, the optional page
title (see command set-page-title below) is displayed <br>
after the component file identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select [fileid] <br>
Select the component file identified by argument fileid.
Argument fileid must be either a page number or a component
file identifier. The select command selects all com&acirc;
<br>
ponent files when the argument fileid is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-shared-ant <br>
Select a component file containing shared annotations. Only
one such component file is supported by the current DjVu
software. This component file usually contains anno&acirc;
<br>
tations pertaining to the whole document as opposed to
specific pages. An error message is displayed if there is no
such component file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create-shared-ant <br>
Create and select a component file containing shared
annotations. This command only selects the shared annotation
component file if such a component file already exists. <br>
Otherwise it creates a new shared annotation component file
and makes sure that it is imported by all pages in the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showsel <br>
Shows the currently selected component files with the same
format as command ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text and annotation commands
<br>
print-pure-txt <br>
Print the text stored in the hidden text layer of the
selected pages. A similar capability is offered by program
djvutxt. Structural information is sometimes represented
<br>
by control characters. Text from different pages is
delimited by form feed characters (&quot;). Lines are
delimited by newline characters (&quot;0). Columns, regions,
and <br>
paragraphs are sometimes delimited by vertical tab (&quot;
13&quot;), group separators (&quot; 35&quot;) and unit
separators (&quot; 37&quot;) respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print-txt <br>
Prints extensive hidden text information for the selected
pages. This information describes the structure of the text
on the document page and locates the structural ele&acirc;
<br>
ments in the page image. The syntax of this output is
described later in this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-txt <br>
Remove the hidden text information from the selected
component files. For instance, executing commands select and
remove-txt removes all hidden text information from the <br>
DjVu document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-txt [djvusedtxtfile] <br>
Insert hidden text information into the selected pages. The
optional argument djvusedtxtfile names a file containing the
hidden text information. This file must contain <br>
data similar to what is produced by command print-txt. When
the optional argument is omitted, the program reads the
hidden text information from the djvused script until <br>
reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output-txt <br>
Prints a djvused script that reconstructs the hidden text
information for the selected pages. This script can later be
edited and executed by invoking program djvused <br>
with option -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print-ant <br>
Prints the annotations of the selected component file. The
annotation data is represented using a simple syntax
described later in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print-merged-ant <br>
Merge the annotations stored in the selected component files
with the annotations imported from other component files
such as the shared annotation component file.. The <br>
annotation data is represented using a simple syntax
described later in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-ant <br>
Remove the annotation information from the selected
component files. For instance, executing commands select and
remove-ant removes all annotation information from the <br>
DjVu document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-ant [djvusedantfile] <br>
Insert annotations into the selected component file. The
optional argument djvusedantfile names a file containing the
annotation data. This file must contain data simi&acirc;
<br>
lar to what is produced by command print-ant. When the
optional argument is omitted, the program reads the
annotation data from the djvused script itself until
reaching <br>
an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output-ant <br>
Print a djvused script that reconstructs the annotation
information for the selected pages. This script can later be
edited and executed by invoking program djvused with <br>
option -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print-meta <br>
Print the metadata part of the annotations for the selected
component file. This command displays a subset of the
information printed by command print-ant using a
differ&acirc; <br>
ent syntax. metadata are organized as key-value pairs. Each
printed line contains the key name such as author,
title,etc., followed by a tab character (&quot;&quot;) and a
dou&acirc; <br>
ble-quoted string representing the UTF-8 encoded metadata
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-meta <br>
Remove the metadata part of the annotations of the selected
component files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-meta [djvusedmetafile] <br>
Set the metadata part of the annotations of the selected
component file. The remaining part of the annotations is
left unchanged. The optional argument djvusedmetafile <br>
names a file containing the metadata. This file must contain
data similar to what is produced by command print-meta. When
the optional argument is omitted, the program <br>
reads the annotation data from the djvused script itself
until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print-xmp <br>
Print the XMP metadata string contained in the annotation
chunk of the selected component file. This command displays
in fact a subset of the information printed by com&acirc;
<br>
mand print-ant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-xmp <br>
Removes the XMP tag from the annotation chunk of the
selected component file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-xmp [xmpfile] <br>
Set the XMP metadata part of the annotations of the selected
component file. The remaining part of the annotations is
left unchanged. The optional argument xmpfile names <br>
a file containing the XMP metadata in a format similar to
that produced by command print-xmp. When the optional
argument is omitted, the program reads the XMP annotation
<br>
data from the djvused script itself until reaching an
end-of-file or a line containing a single period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output-all <br>
Print a djvused script that reconstructs both the hidden
text and the annotation information for the selected pages.
This script can later be edited and executed by <br>
invoking program djvused with option -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outline/bookmarks commands <br>
print-outline <br>
Print the outline of the document. Nothing is printed if the
document contains no outline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-outline <br>
Removes the outline from the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-outline [djvusedoutlinefile]
<br>
Insert outline information into the document. The optional
argument djvusedoutlinefile names a file containing the
outline information. This file must contain data simi&acirc;
<br>
lar to what is produced by command print-outline. When the
optional argument is omitted, the program reads the hidden
text information from the djvused script until <br>
reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thumbnail commands <br>
set-thumbnails sz <br>
Compute thumbnails of size szxsz pixels and insert them into
the document. DjVu viewers can later display these
thumbnails very efficiently without need to download the
<br>
data for each page. Typical thumbnail size range from 48 to
128 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-thumbnails <br>
Remove the pre-computed thumbnails from the DjVu document.
New thumbnails can then be computed using command
set-thumbnails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save commands <br>
The above commands only modify the memory image of the DjVu
document. The following commands provide means to save the
modified data into the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save Save the modified DjVu
document back into the input file djvufile specified by the
arguments of the program djvused. Nothing is done if the
DjVu file was not modified. <br>
Passing option -s program djvused is equivalent to executing
command save before exiting the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-bundled filename <br>
Save the current DjVu document as a bundled multi-page DjVu
document named filename. A similar capability is offered by
program djvmcvt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-indirect filename <br>
Save the current DjVu document as an indirect multi-page
DjVu document. The index file of the indirect document will
be named filename. All other files composing the <br>
indirect document will be saved into the same directory as
the index file. A similar capability is offered by program
djvmcvt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-page filename <br>
Save the selected component file into DjVu file filename.
The selected component file might import data from another
component file using the so-called inclusion ( INCL ) <br>
chunks. This command then produces a file with unresolved
references to imported data. Such a file should then be made
part of a multi-page document containing the <br>
required data in other component files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-page-with filename <br>
Save the selected component file into DjVu file filename.
All data imported from other component files is copied into
the output file as well. This command always pro&acirc; <br>
duces a usable DjVu file. On the other hand, collecting
several such files into a multi-page document might lead to
useless data replication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous commands <br>
help Display a help message listing all commands supported
by djvused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump Display the EA IFF 85
structure of the document or of the selected component file.
A similar capability is offered by program djvudump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size Display the width and the
height of the selected pages. The dimensions of each page
are displayed using a syntax suitable for direct insertion
into the &lt;EMBED...&gt;&lt;/EMBED&gt; <br>
tags. This command also displays the default page
orientation when it is different from zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-rotation [+-]rot <br>
Changes the default orientation of the selected pages. The
orientation is expressed as an integer in range 0..3
representing a number of 90 degree counter-clockwise
rota&acirc; <br>
tions. When the argument is preceded by a sign + or -,
argument rot counts how many additional 90 degree
counter-clockwise rotations should be applied to the page.
Other&acirc; <br>
wise, argument rot represents the desired absolute page
orientation. Only DjVu pages can be rotated. Pages
represented as a raw IW44 image cannot be rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-dpi dpi <br>
Sets the resolution of the page image in dots per inche.
Argument dpi should be in range 25..6000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-page-title title <br>
Sets a page title for the selected page. When page titles
are available, recent versions of the DjVuLibre viewers
display these page titles instead of page numbers and <br>
also accept them in page selection options. Command ls can
be used to see both the page titles and page identifiers. To
unset a page title, simply make it equal to the <br>
page identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVUSED FILE FORMATS <br>
Djvused uses a simple parenthesized syntax to represent both
annotations and hidden text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This syntax is the native
syntax used by DjVu for storing annotations. Program djvused
simply compresses the annotation data using the bzz(1)
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This syntax differs from the
native syntax used by DjVu for storing the hidden text.
Program djvused performs the translations between the
compact binary representation used <br>
by DjVu and the easily modifiable parenthesized syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General syntax <br>
Djvused files are ASCII text files. The legal characters in
djvused files are the printable ASCII characters and the
space, tab, cr, and nl characters. Using other characters
<br>
has undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Djvused files are composed of a
sequence of expressions separated by blank characters
(space, tab, cr, or nl). There are four kind of expressions,
namely integers, symbols, <br>
strings and lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integers: <br>
Integer numbers are represented by one or more digits, with
the usual interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbols: <br>
Symbols, or identifiers, are sequences of printable ascii
characters representing a name or a keyword. Acceptable
characters are the alpha-numeric characters, the
under&acirc; <br>
score &quot;_&quot;, the minus character &quot;-&quot;, and
the hash character &quot;#&quot;. Names should not begin
with a digit or a minus character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings: <br>
Strings denote an arbitrary sequence of bytes, usually
interpreted as a sequence of UTF-8 encoded characters.
Strings in djvused files are similar to strings in the C
<br>
language. They are surrounded by double quote characters.
Certain sequences of characters starting with a backslash
(&quot; <br>
by letter &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;t&quot;,
&quot;n&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;,
&quot; <br>
DOUBLEQUOTE(042) respectively. A backslash followed by one
to three digits stands for the byte whose octal code is
expressed by the digits. All other backslash sequences <br>
are illegal. All non printable ascii characters must be
escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists: Lists are sequence of
expressions separated by blanks and surrounded by
parentheses. All expressions types are acceptable within a
list, including sub-lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hidden text syntax <br>
The building blocks of the hidden text syntax are lists
representing each structural component of the hidden text.
Structural components have the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(type xmin ymin xmax ymax ...
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symbol type must be one of
page, column, region, para, line, word, or char, listed here
by decreasing order of importance. The integers xmin, ymin,
xmax, and ymax represent <br>
the coordinates of a rectangle indicating the position of
the structural component in the page. Coordinates are
measured in pixels and have their origin at the bottom left
cor&acirc; <br>
ner of the page. The remaining expressions in the list
either is a single string representing the encoded text
associated with this structural component, or is a sequence
of <br>
structural components with a lesser type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hidden text for each page is
simply represented by a single structural element of type
page. Various level of structural information are
acceptable. For instance, the page <br>
level component might only specify a page level string, or
might only provide a list of lines, or might provide a full
hierarchy down to the individual characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outline/Bookmark syntax <br>
The outline syntax is a single list of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(bookmarks ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first element of the list is
symbol bookmarks. The subsequent elements are lists
representing the toplevel outline entries. Each outline
entry is represented by a list with <br>
the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(title url ... )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string title is the title of
the outline entry. The destination string url can be either
an arbitrary percent encoded URL, or composed of the hash
character (&quot;#&quot;) followed <br>
by a page name or number, or composed of the question mark
character (&quot;?&quot;) followed by cgi-style arguments
interpreted by the djvu viewer. The remaining expressions in
the list <br>
describe subentries of this outline entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annotation syntax <br>
Annotations are represented by a sequence of annotation
expressions. The following annotation expressions are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(background color) <br>
Specify the color of the viewer area surrounding the DjVu
image. Colors are represented with the X11 hexadecimal
syntax #RRGGBB. For instance, #000000 is black and <br>
#FFFFFF is white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(zoom zoomvalue) <br>
Specify the initial zoom factor of the image. Argument
zoomvalue can be one of stretch, one2one, width, page, or
composed of the letter d followed by a number in range 1
<br>
to 999 representing a zoom factor (such as in d300 or d150
for instance.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(mode modevalue) <br>
Specify the initial display mode of the image. Argument
modevalue is one of color, bw, fore, or back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(align horzalign vertalign) <br>
Specify how the image should be aligned on the viewer
surface. By default the image is located in the center.
Argument horzalign can be one of left, center, or right.
<br>
Argument vertalign can be one of top, center, or bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(maparea url comment area ...)
<br>
Define an hyper-link for the specified destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument url can have one of the
following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">href <br>
(url href target)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where href is a string
representing the destination and target is a string
representing the target frame for the hyper-link, as defined
by the HTML anchor tag &lt;A&gt;. The <br>
destination string href can be either an arbitrary percent
encoded URL, or composed of the hash character
(&quot;#&quot;) followed by a page name or number, or
composed of the ques&acirc; <br>
tion mark character (&quot;?&quot;) followed by cgi-style
arguments interpreted by the djvu viewer. Page numbers may
be prefixed with an optional sign to represent a page
dis&acirc; <br>
placement. For instance the strings &quot;#-1&quot; and
&quot;#+1&quot; can be used to access the previous page and
the next page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument comment is a string
that might be displayed by the viewer when the user moves
the mouse over the hyper-link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument area defines the shape
and the location of the hyperlink. The following forms are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(rect xmin ymin width height)
<br>
(oval xmin ymin width height) <br>
(poly x0 y0 x1 y1 ... ) <br>
(text xmin ymin width height) <br>
(line x0 y0 x1 y1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All parameters are numbers
representing coordinates. Coordinates are measured in pixels
and have their origin at the bottom left corner of the
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining expressions in the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A first set of options defines
how borders are drawn for rect, oval, polygon, or text
hyperlink areas.</p>

(shadow_ein [thickness]) <br>
(shadow_eout [thickness])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where parameter color has syntax
#RRGGBB as described above, and parameter thickness is an
integer in range 1 to 32. The last four border options are
only supported for <br>
rect hyperlink areas. Although the border mode defaults to
(xor), it is wise to always specify the border mode. Border
options do not apply to line areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a border option is
specified, the border becomes visible when the user moves
the mouse over the hyperlink. The border may be made always
visible by using the follow&acirc; <br>
ing option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(border_avis)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following two options may be
used with rect hyperlink areas. The complete area will be
highlighted using the specified color at the specified
opacity (0-100, default <br>
50).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is often used with an empty
URL for simply emphasizing a specific segment of an
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following three options may
be used with line areas to specify an optional ending arrow,
the line width and color. The default is a black line with
width 1 and with&acirc; <br>
out arrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(arrow) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally the following three
options can be used with text areas. The default background
color is transparent. The default text color is black. The
pushpin option indi&acirc; <br>
cates that the text is symbolized by a small pushpin icon.
Clicking the icon reveals the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(metadata ... (key value) ... )
<br>
Define metadata entries. Each entry is identified by a
symbol key representing the nature of the meta data entry.
The string value represents the value associated with <br>
the corresponding key. Two sets of keys are noteworthy: keys
borrowed from the BibTex bibliography system, and keys
borrowed from the PDF DocInfo metadata. BibTex keys <br>
are always expressed in lowercase, such as year, booktitle,
editor, author, etc.. DocInfo keys start with an uppercase
letter, such as Title, Author, Subject, Creator, <br>
Produced, Trapped, CreationDate, and ModDate. The values
associated with the last two keys should be dates expressed
according to RFC 3339.</p>
