<p>PMIE_CHECK(1) General Commands Manual PMIE_CHECK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmie_check, pmie_daily - administration of the Performance
Co-Pilot inference engine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmie_check [-CNsV] [-c control] [-l logfile]
<br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmie_daily [-NV] [-c control] [-k discard]
[-l logfile] [-m addresses] [-x compress] [-X program] [-Y
regex]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This series of shell scripts and associated control files
may be used to create a customized regime of administration
and management for the Performance Co-Pilot (see
PCPin&acirc; <br>
tro(1)) inference engine, pmie(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmie_daily is intended to be run
once per day, preferably in the early morning, as soon after
midnight as practicable. Its task is to rotate the log files
for the running pmie <br>
processes - these files may grow without bound if the
&lsquo;&lsquo;print&rsquo;&rsquo; action is used, or any
other pmie action writes to its stdout/stderr streams. After
some period, old pmie log <br>
files are discarded. This period is 14 days by default, but
may be changed using the -k option. Two special values are
recognized for the period (discard), namely 0 to keep no
<br>
log files beyond the current one, and forever to prevent any
log files being discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log files can optionally be
compressed after some period (compress), to conserve disk
space. This is particularly useful for large numbers of pmie
processes under the control of <br>
pmie_check. The -x option specifies the number of days after
which to compress archive data files, and the -X option
specifies the program to use for compression - by default
<br>
this is xz(1). Use of the -Y option allows a regular
expression to be specified causing files in the set of files
matched for compression to be omitted - this allows only the
<br>
data file to be compressed, and also prevents the program
from attempting to compress it more than once. The default
regex is
&quot;.(meta|index|Z|gz|bz2|zip|xz|lzma|lzo|lz4)$&quot; -
<br>
such files are filtered using the -v option to egrep(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the -m option causes
pmie_daily to construct a summary of the log files generated
for all monitored hosts in the last 24 hours (lines matching
&lsquo;&lsquo; OK &rsquo;&rsquo; are culled), and e- <br>
mail that summary to the set of space-separated
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmie_check may be run at any
time, and is intended to check that the desired set of
pmie(1) processes are running, and if not to re-launch any
failed inference engines. Use of <br>
the -s option provides the reverse functionality, allowing
the set of pmie processes to be cleanly shutdown. Use of the
-C option queries the system service runlevel information
<br>
for pmie, and uses that to determine whether to start
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both pmie_check and pmie_daily
are controlled by PCP inference engine control file(s) that
specify the pmie instances to be managed. The default
control file is $PCP_PMIECON&acirc; <br>
TROL_PATH but an alternate may be specified using the -c
option. If the directory $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d (or
control.d from the -c option) exists, then the contents of
any <br>
additional control files therein will be appended to the
main control file (which must exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The
$PCP_PMIECONTROL_PATH and $PCP_PMIECONTROL_PATH.d files must
not be writable by any user other than root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control file(s) should be
customized according to the following rules that define for
the current version (1.1) of the control file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Lines beginning with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; are comments. <br>
2. Lines beginning with a &lsquo;&lsquo;$&rsquo;&rsquo; are
assumed to be assignments to environment variables in the
style of sh(1), and all text following the
&lsquo;&lsquo;$&rsquo;&rsquo; will be eval&rsquo;ed by the
script <br>
reading the control file, and the corresponding variable
exported into the environment. This is particularly useful
to set and export variables into the environment of the <br>
administrative script, e.g. <br>
$ PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20 <br>
3. There must be a version line in the initial control file
of the form: <br>
$ version=1.1 <br>
4. There should be one line in the control file(s) for each
pmie instance of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host y|n y|n logfile args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Fields within a line of the
control file(s) are separated by one or more spaces or tabs.
<br>
6. The first field is the name of the host that is the
default source of the performance metrics for this pmie
instance. <br>
7. The second field indicates if this is a primary pmie
instance (y) or not (n). Since the primary inference engine
must run on the local host, and there may be at most one
<br>
primary for a particular host, this field can be y for at
most one pmie instance, in which case the host name must be
the name of the local host. When generating pmie con&acirc;
<br>
figuration files, the primary clause indicates that pmieconf
(1) should enable all rules in the primary group, in
addition to all other default rules. <br>
8. The third field indicates whether this pmie instance
needs to be started under the control of pmsocks(1) to
connect to a pmcd through a firewall (y or n). <br>
9. The fourth field is the name of the pmie activity log
file. A useful convention is that pmie instances monitoring
the local host with hostname myhost are maintained in the
<br>
directory $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/myhost, while activity logs for
the remote host mumble are maintained in
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/mumble. This is consistent with the way
pmlogger(1) <br>
maintains its activity logs and archive files. <br>
10. All other fields are interpreted as arguments to be
passed to pmie(1). Most typically this would be the -c
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sample control
lines specify one pmie instance monitoring the local host
(wobbly), and another monitoring performance metrics from
the host splat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wobbly n PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/wobbly
-c config.default <br>
splat n PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/splat -c splat/cpu.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical crontab(5) entries for
periodic execution of pmie_daily and pmie_check are given in
$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmie/crontab (unless installed by default
in /etc/cron.d already) and <br>
shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># daily processing of pmie logs
<br>
08 0 * * * $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmie_daily <br>
# every 30 minutes, check pmie instances are running <br>
28,58 * * * * $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmie_check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to ensure that mail is
not unintentionally sent when these scripts are run from
cron(8) diagnostics are always sent to log files. By
default, these files are <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/pmie_daily.log and
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/pmie_check.log but this can be changed
using the -l option. If this log file already exists when
the script starts, it <br>
will be renamed with a .prev suffix (overwriting any log
file saved earlier) before diagnostics are generated to the
new log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from the cron
execution of the scripts may be extended using the -V option
to the scripts which will enable verbose tracing of their
activity. By default the scripts <br>
generate no output unless some error or warning condition is
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N option enables a
&lsquo;&lsquo;show me&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, where the actions
are echoed, but not executed, in the style of
&lsquo;&lsquo;make -n&rsquo;&rsquo;. Using -N in conjunction
with -V maximizes the diagnostic <br>
capabilities for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMIECONTROL_PATH <br>
the default PCP inference engine control file <br>
Warning: this file must not be writable by any user other
than root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_PMIECONTROL_PATH.d <br>
optional directory containing additional PCP inference
engine control files, typically one per host <br>
Warning: this files herein must not be writable by any user
other than root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmie/crontab
<br>
sample crontab for automated script execution by $PCP_USER
(or root) - exists only if the platform does not support the
/etc/cron.d mechanism.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmie/config.default
<br>
default pmlogger configuration file location for a localhost
inference engine, typically generated automatically by
pmieconf(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/hostname <br>
default location for the pmie log file for the host
hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/hostname/lock
<br>
transient lock file to guarantee mutual exclusion during
pmie administration for the host hostname - if present, can
be safely removed if neither pmie_daily nor <br>
pmie_check are running</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES <br>
PCP &lsquo;&lsquo;notices&rsquo;&rsquo; file used by pmie(1)
and friends</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
