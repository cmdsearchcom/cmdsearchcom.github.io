<p>KILLER(1) KILLER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
killer - Background job killer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
killer [-h] [-V] [-n] [-d]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
killer is a perl script that gets rid of background jobs.
Background jobs are defined as processes that belong to
users who are not currently logged into the machine. Jobs
can <br>
be run in the background (and are expempt from
killer&rsquo;s acctions) if their scheduling priority has
been reduced by increasing their nice(1) value or if they
are being run through <br>
condor. For more details, see the PACKAGE main section of
this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections describe
the perl(1) packages that make up the killer program. I
don&rsquo;t expect that the version that works for me will
work for everyone. I think that the <br>
ProcessTable and Terminals packages offer enough flexibility
that most modifications can be done in the main package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Tell me how to get help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not kill, just print what
would be killed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable debug output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE ProcessTable <br>
Each ProcessTable object contains hashes (or associative
arrays) that map various aspects of a job to the process ID
(PID). The following hashes are provided:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2user Login name associated
with the effective UID that the process is running as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2ruser Login name associate
with the real UID that the process is running as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2uid Effective UID that the
process is running as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2ruid Real UID that the
process is running as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2tty Terminal associated with
the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2ppid Parent process of the
process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2nice nice(1) value of the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid2comm Command name of the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the
%remainingprocs hash provides the list of processes that
will be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intended use of this package
calls for readProcessTable to be called to fill in all of
the hashes defined above. Then, processes that meet specific
requirements are removed <br>
from the %remainingprocs hash. Those that are not removed
are considered to be background processes and may be
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new <br>
This function creates a new ProcessTable object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $ptable = new
ProcessTable;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialize <br>
This function (re)initializes arrays and any environment
variables for external commands. It generally will not need
to be called, as it is invoked by new().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Empty out the process table
for reuse <br>
$ptable-&gt;initialize();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readProcessTable <br>
This function executes the ps(1) command to figure out which
processes are running. Note that it requires a SYSV style
ps(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get a list of processes from
the OS <br>
$ptable-&gt;readProcessTable();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleanForkBombs <br>
This function looks for a large number of processes owned by
one user, and assumes that it is someone that is using
fork() for the first time. An effective way to clean up such
<br>
a mess is to &quot;kill -STOP&quot; each process then
&quot;kill -KILL&quot; each process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note this function ignores such
mistakes by root. If root is running a fork(2) bomb, this
script wouldn&rsquo;t run, right? Also, you should be sure
that the number of processes <br>
mentioned below (490) is less (equal to would be better,
right?) than the maximum number of processes per user. Also,
the OS should have a process limit at least a couple <br>
hundred higher than any individual. Otherwise, you will have
to use the power switch to get rid of fork bombs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each time a process is sent a
signal, it is logged via syslog(3C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get rid of fork bombs. Keep
track of who did it in @idiots. <br>
my @idiots = $ptable-&gt;cleanForkBombs();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getUserProcessIds user <br>
This returns the list of process ID&rsquo;s where the login
associated with the real UID of the process matches the
argument to the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Find all processes owned by
httpd <br>
my @webservers =
$ptable-&gt;getUserProcessIds(&rsquo;httpd&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getUniqueTtys <br>
This function returns a list of terminals in use. Note that
the format will be the same as given by ps(1), which will
generally lack the leading &quot;/dev/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get a list of all terminals
that processes are attached to <br>
my @ttylist = $ptable-&gt;getUniqueTtys();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removeProcessId pid <br>
This function removes pid from the list of processes to be
killed. That is, it gets rid of a process that should be
allowed to run. Most likely this will only be called by <br>
other functions in this package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># For some reason I know that
PID 1234 should be allowed to run <br>
$ptable-&gt;removeProcessId(1234);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removeProcesses psfield, psvalue
<br>
This function removes processes that possess certain traits.
For example, if you want to get rid of all processes owned
by the user &quot;lp&quot; or all processes that have
/dev/console <br>
as their controlling terminal, this is the function for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psfield can be any of the
following</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid Removes process id given in
second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user Removes processes with
effective UID associated with login name given in second
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ruser Removes processes with
real UID associated with login name given in second
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid Removes processes with
effective UID given in second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ruid Removes processes with real
UID given in second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tty Removes processes with
controlling terminal given in second argument. Note that it
should NOT start with &quot;/dev/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppid Removes children of process
with PID given in second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice Removes children with a
nice value equal to the second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comm Removes children with a
command name that is the same as the second argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Allow all imapd processes to
run <br>
$ptable-&gt;removeProcesses(&rsquo;comm&rsquo;,
&rsquo;imapd&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Be sure not to kill print jobs
<br>
$ptable-&gt;removeProcesses(&rsquo;ruser&rsquo;,
&rsquo;lp&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removeChildren pid <br>
This function removes all decendents of the given pid. That
is, if the pid argument is 1, it will ensure that nothing is
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Be sure not to kill off any
mail deliveries (assumes you have <br>
# written getSendmailPid()). (Sendmail changes uid when it
does <br>
# local delivery.) <br>
$ptable-&gt;removeChildren(getSendmailPid);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removeCondorChildren <br>
Condor is a batch job system that allows migration of jobs
between machines (see http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/). This
ensures that condor jobs are left alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Be nice to the people that are
running their jobs through condor. <br>
$ptable-&gt;removeCondorChildren();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">findChildProcs pid <br>
This function finds and returns a list of all of the
processess that are descendents of a the PID given in the
first argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Find the processes that are
decendents of PID 1234 <br>
my @procs = $ptable-&gt;findChildProcs(1234);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getTtys user <br>
This function returns a list of tty&rsquo;s that are in use
by processes owned by a particular user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># find all tty&rsquo;s in use by
gerdts. <br>
my @ttylist = getTtys(&rsquo;gerdts&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getUsers <br>
This function lists all the users that have active
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get all users that are logged
in <br>
my @lusers = $ptable-&gt;getUsers()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removeNiceJobs <br>
This function removes all jobs that have a nice value
greater than 9. That is, they have a lower sceduling
priority than the default (0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Allow people to run background
jobs so long as they yield to <br>
# those with &quot;foreground&quot; jobs <br>
$ptable-&gt;removeNiceJobs();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printProcess filehandle, pid
<br>
This function displays information about the process, kinda
like &quot;ps | grep&quot; would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Print info about init to
STDERR <br>
$ptable-&gt;printProcess(TDERR, 1);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printProcessTable <br>
printProcessTable filehandle <br>
This function prints info about all the processes discoverd
by readProcessTable. If an argument is given, it should be a
file handle to which the output should be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Print the process table to
stdout <br>
$ptable-&gt;printProcessTable();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Mail the process table to
someone <br>
open MAIL &rsquo;|/usr/bin/mail someone&rsquo;; <br>
$ptable-&gt;printProcessTable(AIL); <br>
close(MAIL);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printRemainingProcesses <br>
printRemainingProcesses filehandle <br>
This function prints info about all the processes discoverd
by readProcessTable, but not removed from %remainingprocs.
If an argument is given, it should be a file handle to <br>
which the output should be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Print the jobs to be killed to
stdout <br>
$ptable-&gt;printRemainingProcesses();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Mail the jobs to be killed to
someone <br>
open MAIL &rsquo;|/usr/bin/mail someone&rsquo;; <br>
$ptable-&gt;printRemainingProcesses(AIL); <br>
close(MAIL);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getRemainingProcesses <br>
Returns a list of processes that are likely background
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get a list of the processes
that I plan to kill <br>
my @procsToKill = $ptable-&gt;getRemainingProcesses();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">killAll signalNumber <br>
Sends the specified signal to all the processes listed. A
syslog entry is made for each signal sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Send all of the remaining
processes a TERM signal, then a <br>
# KILL signal <br>
$ptable-&gt;killAll(15); <br>
sleep(10); # Give them a bit of a chance to clean up <br>
$ptable-&gt;killAll(9);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE Terminals <br>
The Terminals package provides a means for figuring out how
long various users have been idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new <br>
This function is used to instantiate a new Terminals
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Get a new Terminals object.
<br>
my $term = new Terminals;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialize <br>
This function figures out who is on the system and how long
they have been idle for. It will generally only be called by
new().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Refresh the state of the
terminals. <br>
$term-&gt;initialize();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showConsoleUser <br>
This function returns the login of the person that is
physically sitting at the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Print out the login of the
person on the console <br>
printf &quot;%s is on the console0,
$term-&gt;showConsoleUser();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initializeTty terminal statparts
<br>
This initializes internal structures for the given
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getX11IdleTime user <br>
Figure out how long a user has been idle in X11. Return the
seconds of idle time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getIdleTime user <br>
Figure out how long a user has been idle. This is
accomplished by examining all terminals that the user owns
and returns the amount of time since the most recently
accessed one <br>
was used. Additionally, if the user is at the console it is
possible that he/she is not typing, yet is quite active with
the mouse or typing into an application that does not <br>
use a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Figure out how long the user
on the console has been idle <br>
my $consoleIdle =
$term-getIdleTime($term-&gt;showConsoleUser());</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printEverything <br>
Prints to stdout who is on what terminal and how long they
have been idle. Only useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Take a look at the contents of
structures in my <br>
# Terminals object <br>
$term-&gt;printEverything();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGE main <br>
The main package is the version used on the Unix
workstations at the University of Wisonsin&rsquo;s
Computer-Aided Engineering Center (CAE). I suspect that
folks at places other than <br>
CAE will want to do things slightly differently. Feel free
to take this as an example of how you can make effective use
of the processTable and Terminals packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration options <br>
$forkadmin Email address to notify of fork bombs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$killadmin Email address to
notify of run-of-the-mill kills</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$fromaddr Who do email messages
claim to be from?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$stubbornadmin <br>
Email address to notify when jobs will not die</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@validusers These are the folks
that you should never kill off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$minuid Do not kill processes of
users with uid lower than this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$maxidletime <br>
The maximum number of seconds that a user can be idle
without being classified as having &quot;background&quot;
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If I am a user really trying to
avoid a background job killer, I would likely include a
signal handler that would wait for signal 15. When I saw it,
I would fork causing the <br>
parent to die and the child would continue on to do my
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming that everyone thinks
like me, I figure that I will need to make at least two
complete passes to clear up the bad users. The first pass is
relatively nice (sends a <br>
signal 15, followed a bit later by a signal 9). A
well-written program will take the signal 15 as a sign that
it should clean up and then shut down. When a process gets a
<br>
signal 9, it has no choice but to die.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second pass is not so nice.
It finds all background processes, sends them a signal 23
(SIGSTOP), then a signal 9 (SIGKILL). This pretty much (but
not absolutely) guarantees <br>
that processes are unable to find a way around the
background job killer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gatherInfo <br>
This function gathers information from the Terminals and
ProcessTable packages, then based on that information
decides which jobs should be allowed to run. Specifically it
does <br>
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Instantiates new
ProcessTable and Terminals objects. Note that Terminals::new
fills in all the necessary structures to catch users that
have logged in between calls to <br>
gatherinfo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Reads the
process table</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removes condor
processes and condor jobs from the list of processes to be
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removes all jobs
belonging to all users in the configuration array
@validusers from the list of processes to be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removes all
nice(1) jobs from the list of jobs to be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removes all jobs
belonging to users where the user has less than $maxidletime
idle time on at least one terminal. Additionally, jobs
associated with ttys that are owned by <br>
users that have less than $maxidletime idle time on at least
one terminal are preserved. This makes it so that if luser
uses su(1) to gain the privileges of boozer, processes <br>
owned by boozer will not be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removes all
processes of users with uid lower than the $minuid
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finally, the
process table and terminal objects are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is a small window of opportunity for a user that
reaches $maxidletime in the middle of this script to get
unfair treatment. This could probably be reconciled by
shaving <br>
some time off of maxidletime for the second call to
main::gatherInfo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is still possible to get
around the background job killer by having a lot of proceses
that watch each other to be sure that they are still
responding (have not yet gotten a <br>
signal 23). As soon as a stopped process is found, the still
running process could fork(), thus leaving a background
process that is not going to be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different operating systems have
different notions of nice values. Some go from -20 to +19.
Some go from 0 to 39. Solaris and HP-UX (using System V ps
command) report nice <br>
values between 0 and 39.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is bad to assume that all
systems that run this have the same number of processes per
user. The script should ask the OS how many processes normal
(non-root) users can run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
The configuration is quite minimalistic. It should be made
possible to have per-host configuration directives so that
you can, for instance, allow certain people to run <br>
background jobs on certain hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">People that really care about
finding habitual offenders will probably want to have a way
to add entries to a database and flag those that pop up too
often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thoroughly test on more
operating systems. A very close relative of this code has
performed well on about 60 Solaris 2.5.1 machines. It has
been lightly tested on HP-UX 10.20 <br>
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make mailing to someone
optional. If you have a lot of workstations killing off
boring stuff all the time, too much meaningless mail traffic
is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you plan to run this on a
machine that runs special processes like a POP or IMAP
server, it would be handy to be able to check multiple
conditions easily. Perhaps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ptable-&gt;removeProcesses( {
comm =&gt; &rsquo;imapd&rsquo;, <br>
parentComm =&gt; &rsquo;inetd&rsquo;, <br>
parentUser =&gt; &rsquo;root&rsquo; } );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would make it so that
people don&rsquo;t rename the crack binary imapd to escape
the wrath of killer.</p>
