<i>killer</i> is a perl script that gets rid of background jobs. Background jobs
  are defined as processes that belong to users who are not currently logged
  into the machine. Jobs can be run in the background (and are expempt from
  <i>killer</i>'s acctions) if their scheduling priority has been reduced by
  increasing their <i>nice</i>(1) value or if they are being run through
  <i>condor</i>. For more details, see the <i>PACKAGE main</i> section of this
  document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following sections describe the <i>perl</i>(1) packages that make up the
  killer program. I don't expect that the version that works for me will work
  for everyone. I think that the ProcessTable and Terminals packages offer
  enough flexibility that most modifications can be done in the main package.

  ProcessTable</a></h1>
Each ProcessTable object contains hashes (or associative arrays) that map
  various aspects of a job to the process ID (PID). The following hashes are
  provided:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">pid2user</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Login name associated with the effective UID that the
      process is running as.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">pid2comm</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Command name of the process.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, the %remainingprocs hash provides the list of processes that will
  be killed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The intended use of this package calls for <i>readProcessTable</i> to be called
  to fill in all of the hashes defined above. Then, processes that meet specific
  requirements are removed from the %remainingprocs hash. Those that are not
  removed are considered to be background processes and may be killed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="new"><a class="selflink" href="#new">new</a></h2>
This function creates a new <i>ProcessTable</i> object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $ptable = new ProcessTable;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="initialize"><a class="selflink" href="#initialize">initialize</a></h2>
This function (re)initializes arrays and any environment variables for external
  commands. It generally will not need to be called, as it is invoked by
  <i>new()</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Empty out the process table for reuse
    $ptable-&gt;initialize();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="readProcessTable"><a class="selflink" href="#readProcessTable">readProcessTable</a></h2>
This function executes the <i>ps</i>(1) command to figure out which processes
  are running. Note that it requires a SYSV style <i>ps</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Get a list of processes from the OS
    $ptable-&gt;readProcessTable();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="cleanForkBombs"><a class="selflink" href="#cleanForkBombs">cleanForkBombs</a></h2>
This function looks for a large number of processes owned by one user, and
  assumes that it is someone that is using <i>fork()</i> for the first time. An
  effective way to clean up such a mess is to &quot;kill -STOP&quot; each
  process then &quot;kill -KILL&quot; each process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note this function ignores such mistakes by root. If root is running a
  <i>fork</i>(2) bomb, this script wouldn't run, right? Also, you should be sure
  that the number of processes mentioned below (490) is less (equal to would be
  better, right?) than the maximum number of processes per user. Also, the OS
  should have a process limit at least a couple hundred higher than any
  individual. Otherwise, you will have to use the power switch to get rid of
  fork bombs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each time a process is sent a signal, it is logged via syslog(3C).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Get rid of fork bombs.  Keep track of who did it in @idiots.
    my @idiots = $ptable-&gt;cleanForkBombs();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getUserProcessIds_user"><a class="selflink" href="#getUserProcessIds_user">getUserProcessIds
  user</a></h2>
This returns the list of process ID's where the login associated with the real
  UID of the process matches the argument to the function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Find all processes owned by httpd
    my @webservers = $ptable-&gt;getUserProcessIds('httpd');
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getUniqueTtys"><a class="selflink" href="#getUniqueTtys">getUniqueTtys</a></h2>
This function returns a list of terminals in use. Note that the format will be
  the same as given by <i>ps</i>(1), which will generally lack the leading
  &quot;/dev/&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Get a list of all terminals that processes are attached to
    my @ttylist = $ptable-&gt;getUniqueTtys();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="removeProcessId_pid"><a class="selflink" href="#removeProcessId_pid">removeProcessId
  pid</a></h2>
This function removes pid from the list of processes to be killed. That is, it
  gets rid of a process that should be allowed to run. Most likely this will
  only be called by other functions in this package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # For some reason I know that PID 1234 should be allowed to run
    $ptable-&gt;removeProcessId(1234);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="removeProcesses_psfield,_psvalue"><a class="selflink" href="#removeProcesses_psfield,_psvalue">removeProcesses
  psfield, psvalue</a></h2>
This function removes processes that possess certain traits. For example, if you
  want to get rid of all processes owned by the user &quot;lp&quot; or all
  processes that have /dev/console as their controlling terminal, this is the
  function for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
psfield can be any of the following
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">pid</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Removes process id given in second argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt class="It-tag">comm</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Removes children with a command name that is the same as
      the second argument.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Allow all imapd processes to run
    $ptable-&gt;removeProcesses('comm', 'imapd');
    # Be sure not to kill print jobs
    $ptable-&gt;removeProcesses('ruser', 'lp');
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="removeChildren_pid"><a class="selflink" href="#removeChildren_pid">removeChildren
  pid</a></h2>
This function removes all decendents of the given pid. That is, if the pid
  argument is 1, it will ensure that nothing is killed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Be sure not to kill off any mail deliveries (assumes you have
    # written getSendmailPid()).  (Sendmail changes uid when it does
    # local delivery.)
    $ptable-&gt;removeChildren(getSendmailPid);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="removeCondorChildren"><a class="selflink" href="#removeCondorChildren">removeCondorChildren</a></h2>
Condor is a batch job system that allows migration of jobs between machines (see
  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/). This ensures that condor jobs are left alone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Be nice to the people that are running their jobs through condor.
    $ptable-&gt;removeCondorChildren();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="findChildProcs_pid"><a class="selflink" href="#findChildProcs_pid">findChildProcs
  pid</a></h2>
This function finds and returns a list of all of the processess that are
  descendents of a the PID given in the first argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<pre>
    # Find the processes that are decendents of PID 1234
    my @procs = $ptable-&gt;findChildProcs(1234);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getTtys_user"><a class="selflink" href="#getTtys_user">getTtys
  user</a></h2>
This function returns a list of tty's that are in use by processes owned by a
  particular user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # find all tty's in use by gerdts.
    my @ttylist = getTtys('gerdts');
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getUsers"><a class="selflink" href="#getUsers">getUsers</a></h2>

    my @lusers = $ptable-&gt;getUsers()
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="removeNiceJobs"><a class="selflink" href="#removeNiceJobs">removeNiceJobs</a></h2>
This function removes all jobs that have a nice value greater than 9. That is,
  they have a lower sceduling priority than the default (0).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Allow people to run background jobs so long as they yield to

</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="printProcess_filehandle,_pid"><a class="selflink" href="#printProcess_filehandle,_pid">printProcess
  filehandle, pid</a></h2>
This function displays information about the process, kinda like &quot;ps |
  grep&quot; would.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Print info about init to STDERR
    $ptable-&gt;printProcess(\*STDERR, 1);

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="printProcessTable"><a class="selflink" href="#printProcessTable">printProcessTable</a></h2>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="printProcessTable_filehandle"><a class="selflink" href="#printProcessTable_filehandle">printProcessTable
  filehandle</a></h2>
This function prints info about all the processes discoverd by
  <i>readProcessTable</i>. If an argument is given, it should be a file handle
  to which the output should be printed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Print the process table to stdout
    $ptable-&gt;printProcessTable();
    # Mail the process table to someone
    open MAIL '|/usr/bin/mail someone';

  <i>readProcessTable</i>, but not removed from %remainingprocs. If an argument
  is given, it should be a file handle to which the output should be printed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Print the jobs to be killed to stdout
    $ptable-&gt;printRemainingProcesses();
    # Mail the jobs to be killed to someone
    open MAIL '|/usr/bin/mail someone';
    $ptable-&gt;printRemainingProcesses(\*MAIL);
    close(MAIL);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getRemainingProcesses"><a class="selflink" href="#getRemainingProcesses">getRemainingProcesses</a></h2>
Returns a list of processes that are likely background jobs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Get a list of the processes that I plan to kill
    my @procsToKill = $ptable-&gt;getRemainingProcesses();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="killAll_signalNumber"><a class="selflink" href="#killAll_signalNumber">killAll
  signalNumber</a></h2>
Sends the specified signal to all the processes listed. A syslog entry is made
  for each signal sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Send all of the remaining processes a TERM signal, then a 
    # KILL signal
    $ptable-&gt;killAll(15);
    sleep(10);          # Give them a bit of a chance to clean up
    $ptable-&gt;killAll(9);
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PACKAGE_Terminals"><a class="selflink" href="#PACKAGE_Terminals">PACKAGE
  Terminals</a></h1>
The Terminals package provides a means for figuring out how long various users
  have been idle.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="new"><a class="selflink" href="#new">new</a></h2>
This function is used to instantiate a new Terminals object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Get a new Terminals object.
    my $term = new Terminals;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="initialize"><a class="selflink" href="#initialize">initialize</a></h2>
This function figures out who is on the system and how long they have been idle
  for. It will generally only be called by <i>new()</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Refresh the state of the terminals.
    $term-&gt;initialize();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="showConsoleUser"><a class="selflink" href="#showConsoleUser">showConsoleUser</a></h2>
This function returns the login of the person that is physically sitting at the
  machine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Print out the login of the person on the console
    printf &quot;%s is on the console\n&quot;, $term-&gt;showConsoleUser();
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="initializeTty_terminal_statparts"><a class="selflink" href="#initializeTty_terminal_statparts">initializeTty
  terminal statparts</a></h2>
This initializes internal structures for the given terminal.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getX11IdleTime_user"><a class="selflink" href="#getX11IdleTime_user">getX11IdleTime
  user</a></h2>
Figure out how long a user has been idle in X11. Return the seconds of idle
  time.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="getIdleTime_user"><a class="selflink" href="#getIdleTime_user">getIdleTime
  user</a></h2>
Figure out how long a user has been idle. This is accomplished by examining all
  terminals that the user owns and returns the amount of time since the most
  recently accessed one was used. Additionally, if the user is at the console it
  is possible that he/she is not typing, yet is quite active with the mouse or
  typing into an application that does not use a terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Figure out how long the user on the console has been idle
    my $consoleIdle = $term-getIdleTime($term-&gt;showConsoleUser());
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="printEverything"><a class="selflink" href="#printEverything">printEverything</a></h2>
Prints to stdout who is on what terminal and how long they have been idle. Only
  useful for debugging.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Take a look at the contents of structures in my 
    # Terminals object
    $term-&gt;printEverything();
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PACKAGE_main"><a class="selflink" href="#PACKAGE_main">PACKAGE
  main</a></h1>
The main package is the version used on the Unix workstations at the University
  of Wisonsin's Computer-Aided Engineering Center (CAE). I suspect that folks at
  places other than CAE will want to do things slightly differently. Feel free
  to take this as an example of how you can make effective use of the
  processTable and Terminals packages.

<div class="Pp"></div>
If I am a user really trying to avoid a background job killer, I would likely
  include a signal handler that would wait for signal 15. When I saw it, I would
  fork causing the parent to die and the child would continue on to do my work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assuming that everyone thinks like me, I figure that I will need to make at
  least two complete passes to clear up the bad users. The first pass is
  relatively nice (sends a signal 15, followed a bit later by a signal 9). A
  well-written program will take the signal 15 as a sign that it should clean up
  and then shut down. When a process gets a signal 9, it has no choice but to
  die.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second pass is not so nice. It finds all background processes, sends them a
  signal 23 (SIGSTOP), then a signal 9 (SIGKILL). This pretty much (but not
  absolutely) guarantees that processes are unable to find a way around the
  background job killer.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="gatherInfo"><a class="selflink" href="#gatherInfo">gatherInfo</a></h2>
This function gathers information from the Terminals and ProcessTable packages,
  then based on that information decides which jobs should be allowed to run.
  Specifically it does the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Instantiates new ProcessTable and Terminals objects. Note
      that Terminals::new fills in all the necessary structures to catch users

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>

      it so that if luser uses <i>su</i>(1) to gain the privileges of boozer,
      processes owned by boozer will not be killed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
There is a small window of opportunity for a user that reaches $maxidletime in
  the middle of this script to get unfair treatment. This could probably be
  reconciled by shaving some time off of maxidletime for the second call to
  main::gatherInfo.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is still possible to get around the background job killer by having a lot of
  proceses that watch each other to be sure that they are still responding (have
  not yet gotten a signal 23). As soon as a stopped process is found, the still
  running process could <i>fork()</i>, thus leaving a background process that is
  not going to be killed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Different operating systems have different notions of nice values. Some go from
  -20 to +19. Some go from 0 to 39. Solaris and HP-UX (using System V ps
  command) report nice values between 0 and 39.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is bad to assume that all systems that run this have the same number of
  processes per user. The script should ask the OS how many processes normal
  (non-root) users can run.

The configuration is quite minimalistic. It should be made possible to have
  per-host configuration directives so that you can, for instance, allow certain

People that really care about finding habitual offenders will probably want to
  have a way to add entries to a database and flag those that pop up too often.

Thoroughly test on more operating systems. A very close relative of this code
  has performed well on about 60 Solaris 2.5.1 machines. It has been lightly
  tested on HP-UX 10.20 as well.

Make mailing to someone optional. If you have a lot of workstations killing off
  boring stuff all the time, too much meaningless mail traffic is generated.

If you plan to run this on a machine that runs special processes like a POP or
  IMAP server, it would be handy to be able to check multiple conditions easily.

<pre>
    $ptable-&gt;removeProcesses( { comm =&gt; 'imapd', 
                                parentComm =&gt; 'inetd',
                                parentUser =&gt; 'root' } );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This would make it so that people don't rename the crack binary imapd to escape
  the wrath of killer.
