<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_systemd_start - start/stop/restart systemd unit files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_systemd_start [debhelper&Acirc;&nbsp;options]
[--restart-after-upgrade] [--no-stop-on-upgrade]
[unit&Acirc;&nbsp;file&Acirc;&nbsp;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_systemd_start is a debhelper program that is responsible
for starting/stopping or restarting systemd unit files in
case no corresponding sysv init script is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with dh_installinit, the unit
file is stopped before upgrades and started afterwards
(unless --restart-after-upgrade is specified, in which case
it will only be restarted <br>
after the upgrade). This logic is not used when there is a
corresponding SysV init script because invoke-rc.d performs
the stop/start/restart in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--restart-after-upgrade <br>
Do not stop the unit file until after the package upgrade
has been completed. This is the default behaviour in compat
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In earlier compat levels the
default was to stop the unit file in the prerm, and start it
again in the postinst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful for daemons
that should not have a possibly long downtime during
upgrade. But you should make sure that the daemon will not
get confused by the package <br>
being upgraded while it&rsquo;s running before using this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-restart-after-upgrade <br>
Undo a previous --restart-after-upgrade (or the default of
compat 10). If no other options are given, this will cause
the service to be stopped in the prerm script and <br>
started again in the postinst script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --no-stop-on-upgrade,
--no-restart-on-upgrade <br>
Do not stop service on upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-start <br>
Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial
installation (the latter is only relevant for services
without a corresponding init script).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should
be called between invocations of this command (with the same
arguments). Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of
<br>
the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that dh_systemd_start
should be run after dh_installinit so that it can detect
corresponding SysV init scripts. The default sequence in dh
does the right thing, this note is <br>
only relevant when you are calling dh_systemd_start
manually.</p>
