cvs-buildpackage - build Debian packages from a CVS repository.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>cvs-buildpackage</b> <i>[options]</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual page explains the Debian <b>cvs-buildpackage</b> utility, which is
  used to build Debian packages whose sources are stored in a <i>CVS</i>
  repository. This is a <b>CVS</b> -aware wrapper around dpkg-buildpackage, and
  it first parses <i>./debian/changelog;</i> exports the corresponding version
  (tagged <i>debian_version_&lt;$version&gt;</i> ), and runs
  <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> in the exported tree. It looks for uncommitted files
  in the source tree, and offers to abort before doing anything so that the user
  may commit the files in, if they wish. <b>cvs-buildpackage</b> can also
  optionally automatically re-tag all files before exporting the source (this
  functionality is only relevant in the top level directory of a checked out
  Debian package source tree, of course).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that the <b>work</b> directory referred to below is the scratch
  directory where the program does its work; it is where it shall export the
  sources from CVS, and it assumes full control of that directory <i>Read:</i>
  anything in that directory, apart from the orig source files, can be deleted
  by <b>cvs-buildpackage</b> Make sure not to have <i>your</i> checked out
  sources/working directory in the same location, as you may lose data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this utility is not run from a top level directory of a checked out Debian
  package source tree, then to build an old version the cvs module name or the
  package name have to be supplied on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Combined with the companion utilities <b>cvs-inject</b> and <b>cvs-upgrade,</b>
  this provides an infrastructure to facilitate the use of <b>CVS</b> by Debian
  maintainers. This allows one to keep separate CVS branches of a package for
  <i>stable,</i> <i>unstable,</i> and possibly <i>experimental</i>
  distributions, along with the other benefits of a version control system.

      However, these recreated original sources are likely to be different for

      the pristine original sources (different enough to cause problems with an
      upload). Thus it is <b>strongly</b> advisable to keep the orig.tar.gz file
      around. Setting this variable overrides the settings for the root

      variable <b>CVSDEB_WORKDIR,</b> and the configuration file variable

The rest of the command line arguments are passed on, uninterpreted, to
  <b>dpkg-buildpackage,</b> though we do pay attention to the -r <b>(root
  command)</b> option (which gives the command to achieve root access, usually
  <i>sudo, fakeroot,</i> or <i>super</i> ). The -r option overrides the other
  means of setting the root command, namely, the environment variable
  <b>CVSDEB_ROOTCOMMAND,</b> which in turn overrides the config file option
  <b>conf_rootcommand.</b> No attempt is made to check any other option. Please
  use the -h option to see which of the <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> options are
  supported and passed on.

Apart from the runtime options, <b>cvs-buildpackage</b> also looks for site-wide
  defaults in the file <i>/etc/cvsdeb.conf.</i> After that, it looks for and
  reads <i>~/.cvsdeb.conf .</i> The default configuration allows there to be a
  site wide override for the root or the cvs-buildpackage working directories on
  the site, but the <i>cvsdeb.conf</i> files are actually Bourne shell snippets,
  and any legal shell directives may be included in there. <b>Note:</b> Caution
  is urged with this file, since you can totally change the way that the script
  behaves by suitable editing this file.
