CVS-BUILDPACKAGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvs-buildpackage - build Debian packages from a CVS
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvs-buildpackage [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page explains the Debian cvs-buildpackage
utility, which is used to build Debian packages whose
sources are stored in a CVS repository. This is a CVS -aware
wrapper <br>
around dpkg-buildpackage, and it first parses
./debian/changelog; exports the corresponding version
(tagged debian_version_&lt;$version&gt; ), and runs
dpkg-buildpackage in the <br>
exported tree. It looks for uncommitted files in the source
tree, and offers to abort before doing anything so that the
user may commit the files in, if they wish. cvs-build&acirc;
<br>
package can also optionally automatically re-tag all files
before exporting the source (this functionality is only
relevant in the top level directory of a checked out Debian
<br>
package source tree, of course).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the work
directory referred to below is the scratch directory where
the program does its work; it is where it shall export the
sources from CVS, and it assumes <br>
full control of that directory Read: anything in that
directory, apart from the orig source files, can be deleted
by cvs-buildpackage Make sure not to have your checked out
<br>
sources/working directory in the same location, as you may
lose data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this utility is not run from
a top level directory of a checked out Debian package source
tree, then to build an old version the cvs module name or
the package name have to be <br>
supplied on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combined with the companion
utilities cvs-inject and cvs-upgrade, this provides an
infrastructure to facilitate the use of CVS by Debian
maintainers. This allows one to keep sep&acirc; <br>
arate CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and
possibly experimental distributions, along with the other
benefits of a version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print out a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M&lt;module&gt; <br>
The name of the CVS module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P&lt;package&gt; <br>
Sets the name of the package. Very useful if this is not
running in the CVS checked out source tree, in which case
one also needs the version of the package, which may <br>
optionally be determined by checking out the latest
debian/changelog file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V&lt;version&gt; <br>
The version number of the package. In conjunction with
setting the package name, this option allows operation
outside a CVS source tree (just needs the repository).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T&lt;tag&gt; <br>
The CVS tag to use for exporting sources, rather than
constructing one from the version. This assumes you know
what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U&lt;tag&gt; <br>
The CVS tag to use for the upstream tag, rather than
constructing one from the upstream version. This assumes you
know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C&lt;Build Command&gt; <br>
Sets the name of the builder program invoked, nominally set
to dpkg-buildpackage. However, the user may choose to use a
different build program, or a wrapper, or even <br>
&rsquo;chroot /opt/root dpkg-buildpackage&rsquo; to build
the package in a chroot jail, if desired. (Obviously, this
requires that the Work directory to be a subdirectory of a
previ&acirc; <br>
ously set up chroot jail). One may also hook in pbuilder by
setting this variable to &rsquo;pdebuild --auto-debsign
--buildresult ../&rsquo;. (Again, this requires that
pbuilder has <br>
been set up correctly). This argument overrides the settings
in the environment variable CVSDEB_BUILDPACKAGE, and the
configuration file variable conf_buildpackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G&lt;get method&gt; <br>
This option, if set, should contain a command to execute to
get the original tarball into the current directory. This
can then be used to allow one to get the original <br>
file using, for instance, wget or curl. This overrides the
CVSDEB_GET_ORIG environment variable and the conf_get_orig
configuration file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Use apt-get source to retrive
the original tarball. This option has no effect unless a
source package with the correct upstream version has already
been uploaded and is <br>
referenced from a Sources file known to apt. If -A and -G
are both given, -G is tried first, and apt is used only if
that did not produce the tarball. This overrides the <br>
CVSDEB_USE_APT environment variable and the conf_use_apt
configuration file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R&lt;root directory&gt; <br>
Root of the original sources archive. We expect to find the
&lt;package name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz file under
&lt;root directory&gt;/package name&gt;/ unless the
cvs-buildpackage <br>
work directory has been set, or we want to export the
original sources from the vendor branch of the CVS tree. If
the cvs-buildpackage work directory is set anywhere, <br>
(command line, configuration file, environment variable),
the root directory value is ignored, since we only need the
root directory to set defaults for the cvs-buildpack&acirc;
<br>
age work directory. This argument overrides the settings in
the environment variable CVSDEB_ROOTDIR, and the
configuration file variable conf_rootdir. Please note that
<br>
the cvs-buildpackage work directory referred to here is the
scratch directory where this program works, not the
directory that the human uses to work in. This should <br>
probably not be a sub dir of CVSROOT, since cvs shall refuse
to export packages there, and the script shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W&lt;work directory&gt; <br>
The full path name for the cvs-buildpackage working
directory, into which the sources will be exported out of
CVS and which should contain the original &lt;pack&acirc;
<br>
age name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz Please note that it
is not strictly essential to have the original sources, as
this script will check out the vendor branch version tagged
<br>
as upstream_version_&lt;version&gt; (without the Debian
revision). However, these recreated original sources are
likely to be different for consecutive runs of
cvs-buildpackage, <br>
and very likely to be different from the pristine original
sources (different enough to cause problems with an upload).
Thus it is strongly advisable to keep the <br>
orig.tar.gz file around. Setting this variable overrides the
settings for the root directory. This argument also
overrides the settings in the environment variable
CVS&acirc; <br>
DEB_WORKDIR, and the configuration file variable
conf_workdir. Please note that the cvs-buildpackage work
directory referred to here is the scratch directory where
this <br>
program works, not the directory that the human uses to work
in. Also, you should specify an absolute path name for the
work directory. This should probably not be a sub <br>
dir of CVSROOT, since cvs shall refuse to export packages
there, and the script shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F The Force Tag option. This
only has effect if run in the source directory. If set, it
forces a cvs tag -F operation to be performed before
exporting the sources. This <br>
argument overrides the settings in the environment variable
CVSDEB_FORCETAG, and the configuration file variable
conf_forcetag. The default action is not to force a tag <br>
before export.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E The Full Export option.
Normally, cvs-buildpackage will export all the data from CVS
using cvs export. If the orig.tar.gz is not available in the
working directory, the <br>
full tree will be exported from CVS regardless of whether
this option is set or not. This option overrides the
environment variable CVSDEB_FULLEXPORT, and the
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file variable conf_fullexport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-op The opposite of full export.
Using this option resets the value of full export. Normally,
cvs-buildpackage will export all the data from CVS using cvs
export. With this <br>
option set, cvs-buildpackage will extract the orig.tar.gz in
the cvs-buildpackage working directory, and then use the cvs
rdiff command to bring that tree up-to-date with <br>
the CVS tree we&rsquo;re building. Please look at the
-f&lt;fix_script&gt; option to see how to massage the source
tree after extraction and patching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ctp Include package_ at the
start of the CVS tag. This overrides the CVSDEB_PACKAGEINTAG
environment variable and the conf_forcetag configuration
file option. The default is <br>
not to include the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The no exec (or dry-run)
option, causing cvs-buildpackage to print out all actions
that would be taken without actually executing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f&lt;fix_script&gt; <br>
This option, if set, should point to a script that should be
run just from the top level of the source tree to set up
permissions of scripts that have been created by <br>
pathching the sources from an recently extracted original
tar file (the behaviour attained by setting the -op option.
This script is called with two arguments, the package <br>
name, and version. This script is only relevant when that
option has been used. There a number of variables that are
exported into the environment, for example package <br>
contains the name of the package, non_epoch_version contains
the version of the package without the epoch,
upstream_version contains the upstream version.
debian_version <br>
contains the debian revision. cvstag contains the cvs tag,
and cvs_upstream_tag contains the tag for the upstream
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H&lt;hook_script&gt; <br>
This option, if set, should point to a script that should be
run just before calling dpkg-buildpackage. Ideally, things
like this are done using the modules file and pro&acirc;
<br>
grams, but is still provided here for convenience. This
script is called with two arguments, the package name, and
version. There a number of variables that are exported <br>
into the environment, for example package contains the name
of the package, non_epoch_version contains the version of
the package without the epoch, upstream_version con&acirc;
<br>
tains the upstream version. debian_version contains the
debian revision. cvstag contains the cvs tag, and
cvs_upstream_tag contains the tag for the upstream version.
<br>
This argument overrides the settings in the environment
variable CVSDEB_HOOK which in turn over rides the
configuration file option conf_hook_script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
This option provides the CVS default module prefix (should
really fix the CVS modules file). This argument overrides
the settings in the environment variable CVSDEB_PRE&acirc;
<br>
FIX. Note: The configuration file variable conf_prefix is
not honoured by cvs-buildpackage, since the prefix is
required to calculate the variables that are supposed to
<br>
be defined when we load the config file (chicken and egg
problem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the command line
arguments are passed on, uninterpreted, to
dpkg-buildpackage, though we do pay attention to the -r
(root command) option (which gives the command to <br>
achieve root access, usually sudo, fakeroot, or super ). The
-r option overrides the other means of setting the root
command, namely, the environment variable
CVSDEB_ROOTCOM&acirc; <br>
MAND, which in turn overrides the config file option
conf_rootcommand. No attempt is made to check any other
option. Please use the -h option to see which of the
dpkg-buildpack&acirc; <br>
age options are supported and passed on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Apart from the runtime options, cvs-buildpackage also looks
for site-wide defaults in the file /etc/cvsdeb.conf. After
that, it looks for and reads ~/.cvsdeb.conf . The default
<br>
configuration allows there to be a site wide override for
the root or the cvs-buildpackage working directories on the
site, but the cvsdeb.conf files are actually Bourne shell
<br>
snippets, and any legal shell directives may be included in
there. Note: Caution is urged with this file, since you can
totally change the way that the script behaves by
suit&acirc; <br>
able editing this file.</p>
