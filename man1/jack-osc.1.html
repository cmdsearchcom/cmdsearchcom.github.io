<p>JACK-OSC(1) JACK-OSC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jack-osc - JACK Transport Publication Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jack-osc [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c : Set the drift correction interval in periods
(default=64). -p : Set the port number (default=57130).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jack-osc publishes the transport state of the local JACK
server as OSC packets over a UDP connection. jack-osc allows
any OSC enabled application to act as a JACK transport <br>
client, receiving sample accurate pulse stream timing data,
and monitoring and initiating transport state change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients request to receive
timing and change notification packets by sending a
&quot;request notification&quot; packet, /receive, to the
jack-osc server. This packet has the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/receive category</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where category is a bit mask
that indicates what categories of notification packets are
requested. The bit locations are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Category Mask -------- ----
REQUEST_TICK 0x0000001 REQUEST_PULSE 0x0000002
REQUEST_CORRECTION 0x0000004 REQUEST_TRANSPORT 0x0000008
REQUEST_ALL 0xFFFFFFF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients request notification
messages to be sent to an address that is not that of the
packet that requests the notification by sending a
&quot;request notification at&quot; packet, <br>
/receive_at. This packet has the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/receive_at category port-number
host-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where category is as for
/receive and where port-number and host-name give the
address that notification should be sent to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a client is registered
subsequent /receive and /receive_at messages edit the
category value for that client. To delete the client from
the register send a request with a <br>
category value of negative one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After requesting notification
the client will receive all relevant timing packets sent by
the server. All jack-osc timing packets are sent at the
start of a JACK period as OSC <br>
message and have the same shape:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag ntp utc frm arg...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where tag is the command name,
and ntp, utc and frm are time stamps that indicate the same
time point, the start of the JACK period when the packet was
sent. ntp is an unsigned <br>
64bit integer NTP value. utc is a double precision real
valued representation of the UTC time. frm is a signed 64bit
integer frame counter the absolute value of which is not
<br>
defined but which increments synchronously with the ntp and
utc time stamps. arg... is the set of tag specific
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timing packets sent by
jack-osc are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/pulse ntp utc frm p-ntp p-utc
p-frm pulse : Pulse Location. This packet indicates that the
nearest frame to the integer pulse pulse occurs at the time
given by the time stamps <br>
p-ntp, p-utc and p-frm. The pulse number is one based. This
packet is sent at the start of the JACK period in which the
integer pulse will occur. This packet is not sent if the
<br>
transport is stopped. This packet is sent before the /tick
packet for the same period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tick ntp utc frm frame pulse :
Period Tick. This packet is sent once per JACK period. The
integer value frame is the transport location in frames, the
double precision real <br>
value pulse is the transport location in pulses. The pulse
value is read from an accumulator and is approximate only,
the accumulator is corrected at each integer pulse
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/drift ntp utc frm ntp-dif
utc-dif : Drift Correction. This packet is sent whenever the
clock drift correction is run. The frequency of this is set
by the -c option to the <br>
jack-osc server. The integer value ntp-dif is the NTP form
of the corrected drift value and utc-dif the UTC form. Since
JACK is a sample clock there is no frame drift value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The state change packets sent by
jack-osc are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/transport ntp utc frm fps ppm
ppc pt state : Transport state change. This packet is sent
whenever the JACK transport changes. The double precision
real value fps is the sample <br>
rate in frames per second. The double precision real value
ppm is the tempo in pulses per minute. The double precision
real value ppc is the measure length in pulses per cycle.
<br>
The double precision real value pt is the pulse type. The
integer value state is zero if the transport has stopped and
one if it has started. See also the /status message <br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients can request the current
frame and pulse values by sending a /current packet, which
requires no argument. The replies with a /current.reply
packet, which has the same form <br>
as a /tick packet. The precise interpretation of packets
acquired in this manner is problematic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients request a status packet
by sending a &quot;request status&quot; packet, /status,
which requires no argument. The server replies immediately
with a status reply packet, <br>
/status.reply. The status packet is an OSC message and is
not timestamped. It has the shape:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/status.reply fps ppm ppc pt
state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the argument values are as
described for the /transport message. It is intended that a
client will request a single status packet before requesting
notification for all <br>
subsequent state changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients initiate a change in
transport roll state by sending a &quot;request transport
operation&quot; packet, /start or /stop to the jack-osc
server. Neither requires an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients initiate a change in
transport location by sending a &quot;request locate
operation&quot; packet, /locate, to the jack-osc server. It
has the shape:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/locate location</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the single precision real
value location is the requested transport location in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients can connect and
disconnect ports by sending /connect and /disconnect
messages to the jack-osc server. Both have the shape:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/[dis]connect left right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jack-osc implements only a
subset of the OSC protocol. In particular it does not
implement the patten matching rules and does not implement a
scheduler for incoming messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jack-osc drops all unrecognized
incoming packets.</p>
