<p>XCLIP(1) General Commands Manual XCLIP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xclip - command line interface to X selections
(clipboard)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xclip [OPTION] [FILE]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads from standard in, or from one or more files, and makes
the data available as an X selection for pasting into X
applications. Prints current X selection to standard
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, -in <br>
read text into X selection from standard input or files
(default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, -out <br>
print the selection to standard out (generally for piping to
a file or program)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -filter <br>
when xclip is invoked in the in mode with output level set
to silent (the defaults), the filter option will cause xclip
to print the text piped to standard in back to <br>
standard out unmodified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, -rmlastnl <br>
when the last character of the selection is a newline
character, remove it. Newline characters that are not the
last character in the selection are not affected. If the
<br>
selection does not end with a newline character, this option
has no effect. This option is useful for copying one-line
output of programs like pwd to the clipboard to <br>
paste it again into the command prompt without executing the
line immideately due to the newline character pwd
appends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, -loops <br>
number of X selection requests (pastes into X applications)
to wait for before exiting, with a value of 0 (default)
causing xclip to wait for an unlimited number of <br>
requests until another application (possibly another
invocation of xclip) takes ownership of the selection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, -target <br>
specify a particular data format using the given target
atom. With -o the special target atom name
&quot;TARGETS&quot; can be used to get a list of valid
target atoms for this <br>
selection. For more information about target atoms refer to
ICCCM section 2.6.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -display <br>
X display to use (e.g. &quot;localhost:0&quot;), xclip
defaults to the value in $DISPLAY if this option is
omitted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -help <br>
show quick summary of options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-selection <br>
specify which X selection to use, options are
&quot;primary&quot; to use XA_PRIMARY (default),
&quot;secondary&quot; for XA_SECONDARY or
&quot;clipboard&quot; for XA_CLIPBOARD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
show version information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-silent <br>
fork into the background to wait for requests, no
informational output, errors only (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet show informational
messages on the terminal and run in the foreground</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
provide a running commentary of what xclip is doing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noutf8 <br>
operate in legacy (i.e. non UTF-8) mode for backwards
compatibility (Use this option only when really necessary,
as the old behavior was broken)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xclip reads text from standard
in or files and makes it available to other X applications
for pasting as an X selection (traditionally with the middle
mouse button). It reads <br>
from all files specified, or from standard in if no files
are specified. xclip can also print the contents of a
selection to standard out with the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xclip was designed to allow
tighter integration of X applications and command line
programs. The default action is to silently wait in the
background for X selection requests <br>
(pastes) until another X application places data in the
clipboard, at which point xclip exits silently. You can use
the -verbose option to see if and when xclip actually
receives <br>
selection requests from other X applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options can be abbreviated as
long as they remain unambiguous. For example, it is possible
to use -d or -disp instead of -display. However, -v
couldn&rsquo;t be used because it is <br>
ambiguous (it could be short for -verbose or -version), so
it would be interpreted as a filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only the first
character of the selection specified with the -selection
option is important. This means that &quot;p&quot;,
&quot;sec&quot; and &quot;clip&quot; would have the same
effect as using <br>
&quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot; or
&quot;clipboard&quot; respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
I hate man pages without examples!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uptime | xclip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put your uptime in the X
selection. Then middle click in an X application to
paste.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xclip -loops 10 -verbose
/etc/motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit after /etc/motd (message of
the day) has been pasted 10 times. Show how many selection
requests (pastes) have been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xclip -o &gt; helloworld.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put the contents of the
selection into a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xclip -t text/html
index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Middle click in an X application
supporting HTML to paste the contents of the given file as
HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY <br>
X display to use if none is specified with the -display
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Please report any bugs, problems, queries, experiences, etc.
directly to the author.</p>
