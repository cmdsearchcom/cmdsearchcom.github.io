<p>HEXER(1) General Commands Manual HEXER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hexer - binary file editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hexer [options] [file [...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hexer is a multi-buffer editor for viewing and manipulating
binary files. It can&rsquo;t (shouldn&rsquo;t) be used for
editing block devices, because it tries to load the whole
file into a <br>
buffer (it should work for diskettes). The most important
features of hexer are: multi buffers, multi level undo,
command line editing with completion, binary regular
expres&acirc; <br>
sions (see below). The user interface is kept similar to vi,
so if you know how to use vi, you&rsquo;ll get started
easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-R, --readonly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --view <br>
Edit files in read only mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recover filename <br>
Recover the file filename after a crash. (not
implemented)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --command command <br>
Start the editing session by executing the editor command
command. If command contains spaces, it must be surrounded
by double quotes. It is possible to specify multiple <br>
commands on the command line: <br>
hexer -c command1 -c command2 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tite <br>
Turn off the usage of the termcap/terminfo ti/te
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print out a short help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+command <br>
This is equivalent to the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The long options are not
available on all systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMIZING <br>
The editor reads its startup commands from the file
~/.hexerrc (another startup file may be specified by setting
the environment variable HEXERRC). Empty lines and lines
start&acirc; <br>
ing with a &lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;&acirc;character (double
quote) are ignored. It is not possible to have a command and
a comment in the same line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR COMMANDS <br>
As in vi, there are several editing modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Mode <br>
Some commands in Command Mode can take a numeric argument.
To enter a numeric argument just type the (decimal) number.
The number will be echoed at the bottom line of the <br>
screen as you type. To enter an octal number, type a
&lsquo;0&rsquo; as the first digit. To enter a hexadecimal
number, type &lsquo;0x&rsquo; (this is not a problem,
because the x-command with a <br>
zero counter wouldn&rsquo;t make sense anyway). Some of the
commands can take a visually selected area as an argument
(see subsection Visual Mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Move backwards to the
beginning of a word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Move to the end of a word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G If a numeric argument n is
given, move the cursor to position n. If no argument is
specified, set the position to the end of the buffer. The
first byte in the buffer <br>
is at position &lsquo;0&rsquo;, so the command to move to
the beginning of the buffer is &lsquo;0G&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-G <br>
Display the buffer name, size, status and the current
position at the bottom line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h j k l <br>
Move the cursor. The arrow keys work as well. The numeric
argument (if specified) determines the number rows or
columns the cursor will move. Different from vi: the <br>
cursor can be positioned behind the last byte in the
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Enter Insert Mode (see below)
at the current position of the point. If a numeric argument
n is given, the typed text will be inserted n times. Note:
Moving the cur&acirc; <br>
sor (using the arrow keys) will discard the numeric
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Move to the next match using
the current RE. This is equivalent to typing
&lsquo;/&rsquo;, &lt;Return&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Move to the previous match
using the current RE. This is equivalent to typing
&lsquo;?&rsquo;, &lt;Return&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-O <br>
Paste over. Copy the kill buffer to the current position
overwriting the contents of the current buffer. If a numeric
argument n is given, the kill buffer is pasted <br>
n times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Paste. Insert the kill buffer
at the current position. If a numeric argument n is given,
the kill buffer is pasted n times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Replace a single byte using
the Replace Mode. If an area is selected, all bytes in the
selected area are replaced. If a numeric argument is given,
the specified num&acirc; <br>
ber of bytes is replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Enter Replace Mode (see
below). If a numeric argument n is given, the replace
command is repeated n times. Note: Moving the cursor (using
the arrow keys) will dis&acirc; <br>
card the numeric argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-R <br>
Redo the last undo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Undo the last change to the
current buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever possible hexer creates
a file name.hexer in the current directory (the swapfile)
for each buffer visited (where name is the name of the
buffer). All changes made to <br>
the buffer name are stored in that file, so it is possible
to undo (and redo) all changes made to the buffer. If the
swapfile can&rsquo;t be created, the undo list is stored in
<br>
the memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Enter Visual Mode (see below).
Visual selection of areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Move forward to the beginning
of a word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Delete the byte under the
cursor. If a numeric argument n is given, n bytes are
deleted. In Visual Mode, the selected area is deleted. Note:
The bytes deleted using <br>
the x-command are not copied to the kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-X <br>
The same as the x-command, but the bytes deleted are copied
to the kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y Yank. Yank the byte under the
cursor into the kill buffer. If a numeric argument n is
given, n bytes are yanked into the kill buffer. In Visual
Mode, the selected <br>
area is copied to the kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zb Place the cursor in the
bottom line of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zt Place the cursor in the top
line of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zz Place the cursor in the
middle line of the screen. <br>
Note that the commands zb, zt and zz don&rsquo;t change the
position in the file - only the screen is scrolled (if
necessary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: Enter Exh Mode (see below).
The Exh Mode is similar to the ex-mode in vi, but not
compatible. If an area is selected, the bounds of the
selection are copied to the <br>
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ Search forward through the
buffer using a RE(regular expression). If no RE is
specified, the RE given in the previous /- or ?-command is
reused. <br>
Note: The REs in hexer are a little bit different from
regular expressions in vi (see section REGULAR
EXPRESSIONS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Search reverse using a regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. Repeat the last change to the
buffer at the current position. This means that if the
previous command deleted n bytes and replaced them by m
other bytes (n or m may <br>
be zero), the .-command will do exactly the same at the
current position in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; Shift the hex column left n
bytes, where n is the (optional) numeric argument. Note that
the &lt;-command only changes the way the buffer is
displayed in the hex column, <br>
the buffer itself is kept unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; Shift the hex column right
n bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-^ <br>
Switch to the alternate buffer (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% Enter a calculator command
(see section CALCULATOR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visual Mode <br>
Select an area on the buffer. You can enter the Visual Mode
by using the v-command or by specifying an area in Exh Mode.
The selection starts at the cursor position when <br>
entering the Visual Mode and ends at the current cursor
position. You can leave the Visual Mode without performing a
command on the selected area by pressing v or Escape. <br>
To perform a command on the selected area simply enter the
command as if you where in Command Mode. Commands that
can&rsquo;t use the selection will ignore it. As in Command
<br>
Mode, it is possible to specify a numeric argument. Commands
that can take the selection as an argument will ignore the
numeric argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert Mode <br>
In Insert Mode the bytes you type are inserted at the
current position of the cursor. At any time, you can toggle
the active column (hex column or text column) by pressing
<br>
the TAB key. If the hex column is active the bytes are
entered as two digit hex numbers, if the text column is
active, the bytes are entered as ASCII text. The Delete or
<br>
BackSpace key deletes the previously inserted byte. If the
hex column is active, the previously inserted nibble (hex
digit) is deleted. It is not possible to delete more <br>
bytes than have been inserted in the current insert command.
While in Insert Mode, you can move the cursor using the
arrow keys. Note that moving the cursor discards the <br>
numeric argument given to the insert command. To leave the
Insert Mode, type Escape. If a numeric argument n was given
to the insert command and is hasn&rsquo;t been discarded by
<br>
a cursor movement, the typed bytes are inserted n times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace Mode <br>
In Replace Mode you replace the bytes under the cursor as
you type. Hitting BackSpace restores the original contents
of the buffer. The effect of a numeric argument is
sim&acirc; <br>
ilar to the Insert Mode: the typed bytes are replaced n
times. As in Insert Mode, moving the cursor using the arrow
keys discards the numeric argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exh Mode <br>
The Exh Mode in hexer is kept similar to the ex-mode in vi.
Typically, an exh command looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:area command arguments <br>
Perform the command command on the area area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:command arguments <br>
Perform the command command at the current position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:area Select the area area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:position <br>
Move the cursor to position position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An area may be defined as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position1,position2 <br>
The area starts at position1 and ends at position2
(inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position <br>
The area selects one byte at position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% The area selects the entire
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A position may be defined
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset A decimal, octal
(prefixed with &lsquo;0&rsquo;) or hex (prefixed with
&lsquo;0x&rsquo;) number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. The beginning of the
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ The end of the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/regexp/ <br>
A regular expression (see section REGULAR EXPRESSIONS). The
buffer is searched forward starting at the current position.
If a match was found, the current position <br>
is set to the position of the match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?regexp? <br>
The buffer is searched reverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands may be abbreviated with
a unique prefix of the command, some commands may be
abbreviated with a single character, even if that character
isn&rsquo;t a unique prefix of the <br>
command name. Currently the following commands are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s, substitute <br>
Synopsis: area s /regexp/replace/flags <br>
Search for the regular expression regexp and replace it with
replace (see section REGULAR EXPRESSIONS). replace may
contain &lsquo;&acute; references to subexpressions of
reg&acirc; <br>
exp. flags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g: global, this flag is ignored
(it doesn&rsquo;t make sense in a binary editor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c: confirm, ask the user to
confirm each substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that the &lsquo;/&rsquo;
character used as separator could be any character,
it&rsquo;s just common practice to use &lsquo;/&rsquo;.)
Trailing separators may be omitted. If area is omitted, <br>
the whole buffer is searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w, write <br>
Synopsis: area w filename <br>
Write area to the file filename. If area is omitted. the
whole buffer is written to the file, if filename is omitted,
the filename associated with the buffer is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r, read <br>
Synopsis: position r filename <br>
Insert the contents of the file filename at position. If
position is omitted, the current position is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e, edit <br>
Synopsis: e name or: e # <br>
Change to buffer name. If there is no such buffer, hexer
tries to open a file named name and load it into a new
buffer. If name is a hash sign (#), the alternate <br>
buffer is selected. On success the current buffer becomes
the alternate buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b, buffer <br>
Synopsis: b name <br>
or: b <br>
Change to buffer name. On success the current buffer becomes
the alternate buffer. If name is omitted, a list of all
buffers is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n, next <br>
Select the next buffer in the buffer list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N, previous <br>
Select the previous buffer in th buffer list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S, skip <br>
Select the next unvisited buffer in the buffer list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rewind Select the first buffer
in the buffer list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wall Write all unsaved
buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, close <br>
Synopsis: c name <br>
or: c! name <br>
or: c <br>
or: c! <br>
Close the buffer name. If name is omitted, the current
buffer is closed. If the buffer has been modified, but not
saved, it can&rsquo;t be closed using a :c-command; use <br>
:c! to override.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h, help <br>
View an online help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q, quit <br>
Synopsis: q name <br>
or: q! name <br>
or: q <br>
or: q! <br>
Close all buffers and exit the editor. If an opened buffer
has bee modified, but not saved, the :q-command can&rsquo;t
be performed; use :q! to override.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vmap Synopsis: map from to <br>
or: imap from to <br>
or: vmap from to <br>
The key sequence from is mapped to to. To enter special keys
(e.g. function keys), mask them using Control-V. :map
affects the Command Mode only, :imap affects the <br>
Insert Mode only and :vmap affects the Visual Mode only. It
is not possible to re-map key sequences on the command line
editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iunmap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vunmap Synopsis: unmap from <br>
or: iunmap from <br>
or: vunmap from <br>
Delete a key mapping created with :map, :imap or :vmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set Synopsis: set variable [...]
<br>
or: set variable=value [...] <br>
or: set novariable [...] <br>
or: set <br>
There are not too many variables that could be modified,
this might change though. The following variables can be
used: iso (bool): display the whole ISO-8859/1 <br>
character set; ascii (bool): display ASCII characters only;
TERM (string): the name of the terminal; maxmatch (number),
specialnl (bool): see section REGULAR EXPRES&acirc; <br>
SIONS. :set called without an argument lists all variables
and values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, delete <br>
Synopsis: area d <br>
Delete all bytes in area. The deleted bytes are copied to
the kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y, yank <br>
Synopsis: area y <br>
Copy the bytes in area to the kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Display the version number of hexer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zz Place the cursor in the
middle line of the screen. Note that the screen is scrolled
(if necessary); the cursor position is kept unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zt Place the cursor in the top
line of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zb Place the cursor in the
bottom line of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wq The same as :x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x, exit <br>
Save all buffers and exit the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command is called and
can&rsquo;t use the given positions, areas or arguments, the
additional positions, areas, arguments are ignored. <br>
Conditional commands: It is possible to specify a list of
terminal names for which the given command should be
executed. The syntax is: <br>
:terminals:command <br>
where terminals is a colon-separated list of terminal names.
The command is executed if and only if the value of TERM is
in the list. I.e. you could have a command like <br>
:xterm:set iso <br>
in your .hexerrc-file (use the ISO character set only if
working on an xterm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor Motion <br>
In Command Mode, Insert Mode, Replace Mode and Visual Mode,
you can use the following cursor motion commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrow Keys <br>
Move the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-F <br>
Move forward one page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-B <br>
Move back one page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-D <br>
Move forward half a page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-U <br>
Move back half a page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE EDITING <br>
On the command line you can use the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpArrow DownArrow <br>
Move up and down through the history of the current
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LeftArrow RightArrow <br>
Move the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-A <br>
Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-E <br>
Move the cursor to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-K <br>
Delete all characters from the current cursor position up to
the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-U <br>
Delete all characters from the beginning of the line up to
the current cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackSpace <br>
Delete the character left of the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control-D <br>
Delete the character under the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter Return <br>
Accept the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escape Discard the line. Note:
This is different from vi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAB Try to complete currently
typed word. If the completion is not unique, the word is
completed as far as unique. If the TAB key is hit twice on
the same position, a list <br>
of all possible completions is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
In this section it is assumed that you are familiar with REs
(regular expressions). In most applications (egrep, vi, ...)
REs work on lines, that means it is not possible to <br>
use a RE containing a line break (newline character). In
hexer, the buffer is not split up into distinct lines and a
newline character is considered to be a &lsquo;normal&rsquo;
character, <br>
now here&rsquo;s the problem: imagine searching for
&quot;a.*b&quot; in a 5 MB file, this would take very long
(might be up to several minutes on a slow machine).
That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a maxmatch <br>
limit (a repeat operator matches at most maxmatch
occurrences of its operand). The default value of maxmatch
is 1024, but it may be customized using the :set-command.
For sim&acirc; <br>
ple expressions (expressions for which the length of the
match can be determined from the expression) it is possible
to override the maxmatch limit by doubling the
&lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;+&rsquo; <br>
operator, e.g. &quot;a.**b&quot; or &quot;foo|r++&quot;.
<br>
Note that the context specifiers
&lsquo;^&rsquo;/&lsquo;$&rsquo; (beginning/end of a line)
and &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;/&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; (beginning/end of
a word) are available and actually do what you expect. If
you don&rsquo;t want the <br>
atoms &lsquo;.&rsquo; and &lsquo;[^...]&rsquo; to match the
newline character you can set the specialnl option using the
:set-command. <br>
To enter a special character, you can use the standard C
&lsquo;&acute;&acirc;escape sequences. To enter a character
using its octal code, use a &lsquo;. <br>
(C-style octal escapes are not supported, because &lsquo;
&rsquo;, ... &lsquo;9&rsquo; are interpreted as
back-references to subexpressions of the RE.) To enter a
character using it&rsquo;s hex code, type <br>
a &lsquo;refix followed by up to two hex digits; decimal
codes can be entered using a &lsquo;&rsquo;&acirc;prefix
followed by up to three decimal digits. It is possible to
enter strings of codes <br>
by doubling the base specifier, e.g. &quot;e ff 5a 7e&quot;
or &quot;Nte that such a string is treated as an atom, i.e.
the RE &quot;f fe*&quot; matches any number (&lt; max&acirc;
<br>
match) of repetitions of ff fe. <br>
It is possible to use all kinds of character
&lsquo;&acute;&acirc;escapes (escapes representing a single
character) within &lsquo;[]&rsquo;&acirc;ranges. Within a
range, the &lsquo;o&rsquo; selecting an octal base for the
<br>
escape may be omitted, since back-references within a range
don&rsquo;t make sense. When specifying a minimum and/or
maximum number of repetitions using the
&lsquo;,}&rsquo;&acirc;operator, the num&acirc; <br>
bers may be given in decimal (no prefix), octal
(&lsquo;0&rsquo;-prefix) or hex (&lsquo;0x&rsquo;-prefix).
If no maximum number is specified and the operand is not a
simple expression, at most maxmatch <br>
matches will be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CALCULATOR <br>
Hexer provides a simple calculator (myc) capable of all
operations available in C. To enter a myc command just enter
a % (percent) sign and an expression in infix notation. It
<br>
is possible to use parentheses. myc understands the
following binary infix operators (from highest priority to
lowest): ** (power), * (multiply), / (divide), % (modulo), +
<br>
(add), - (subtract), &lt;&lt; (shift left), &gt;&gt; (shift
right), &lt; (less), &lt;= (less or equal), &gt; (greater),
&gt;= (greater or equal), == (equal), != (not equal), &amp;
(arithmetical and), | <br>
(arithmetical or), ^ (arithmetical exclusive or), &amp;&amp;
(logical and), || (logical or), = (assign); and the
following unary prefix operators: - (negate, unary minus), !
(logical <br>
not), ~ (bitwise complement). myc knows three data types:
boolean, integer (32 bit), float (64 bit, equivalent to C
double). On some esoteric platforms the precision of integer
<br>
and float may be different. As in C the result of a division
depends on the data types of the operands. An integer
divided by an integer yields an integer. If you want the
<br>
result to be a float, make sure one of the operands is a
float, e.g. type 4/7. instead of 4/7 or a/(b+0.) instead of
a/b. The power operation returns a float if the result is
<br>
too large to fit in an integer. The result of a calculation
is stored in the special variables $$ and $n where n is the
number of the command.</p>
