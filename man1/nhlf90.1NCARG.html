<p>NHLF90(1NCARG) NCAR GRAPHICS NHLF90(1NCARG)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nhlf90 - Command for compiling Fortran code that uses the
NCAR Graphics high-level utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nhlf90 [-ngmath] [-ncarbd] [-ngmathbd] [-netcdf] [-hdf]
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nhlf90 is a script that invokes the FORTRAN 90
compiler/linker with the proper NCAR Graphics LLU (low-level
utility) and HLU (high-level utility) libraries. Arguments
presented <br>
above are associated with NCAR Graphics. All other arguments
and options are identical to the f90 command on your
particular machine; arguments that include quoted strings
may <br>
have to be enclosed in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to run nhlf90, you must
have your NCARG_ROOT environment variable set to the
directory pathname where the NCAR Graphics libraries,
binaries, and include files were <br>
installed. If you are not sure what NCARG_ROOT should be set
to, please check with your system administrator or the site
representative for NCAR Graphics. If the NCAR Graphics <br>
libraries, binaries, and include files were not installed
under one root directory, then you will need to set the
environment variables NCARG_LIB, NCARG_BIN, and
NCARG_INCLUDE <br>
instead. Please see &quot;man ncargintro&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, on some systems, if
you supply your own binary libraries in addition to the ones
automatically referenced by nhlf90, all the libraries must
have been created in a sim&acirc; <br>
ilar fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngmath <br>
Links in the NCAR Graphics ngmath library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncarbd <br>
Use this option for compilers that appear to be having
trouble initializing blockdata variables. It will cause a
small subroutine to be linked in that helps force the <br>
loading of blockdata initialization routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngmathbd <br>
Just like with the -ncarbd option, use this option for
compilers that appear to be having trouble initializing
Ngmath-related blockdata variables. It will cause a small
<br>
subroutine to be linked in that helps force the loading of
Ngmath blockdata initialization routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this option doesn&rsquo;t
need to be specified separately if you are already including
the -ncarbd and -ngmath options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-netcdf <br>
Links in the netCDF library. This library is not part of
NCAR Graphics, so check with your system administrator if
you need it installed. You can obtain a copy of it by <br>
doing an anonymous ftp to unidata.ucar.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hdf Links in the HDF library.
This library is not part of NCAR Graphics, so check with
your system administrator if you need it installed. You can
obtain a copy of it by <br>
doing an anonymous ftp to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.</p>
