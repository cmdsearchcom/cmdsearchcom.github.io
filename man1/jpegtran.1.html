<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jpegtran - lossless transformation of JPEG files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jpegtran [ options ] [ filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jpegtran performs various useful transformations of JPEG
files. It can translate the coded representation from one
variant of JPEG to another, for example from baseline JPEG
to <br>
progressive JPEG or vice versa. It can also perform some
rearrangements of the image data, for example turning an
image from landscape to portrait format by rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtran works by rearranging
the compressed data (DCT coefficients), without ever fully
decoding the image. Therefore, its transformations are
lossless: there is no image <br>
degradation at all, which would not be true if you used
djpeg followed by cjpeg to accomplish the same conversion.
But by the same token, jpegtran cannot perform lossy
opera&acirc; <br>
tions such as changing the image quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtran reads the named
JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file is named,
and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, -optimize
may be written -opt or -o. Upper and lower case are
equivalent. British spellings are also accepted (e.g.,
-opti&acirc; <br>
mise), though for brevity these are not mentioned below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify the coded JPEG
representation used in the output file, jpegtran accepts a
subset of the switches recognized by cjpeg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-optimize <br>
Perform optimization of entropy encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progressive <br>
Create progressive JPEG file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restart N <br>
Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows, or every N MCU
blocks if &quot;B&quot; is attached to the number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arithmetic <br>
Use arithmetic coding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scans file <br>
Use the scan script given in the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See cjpeg(1) for more details
about these switches. If you specify none of these switches,
you get a plain baseline-JPEG output file. The quality
setting and so forth are <br>
determined by the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image can be losslessly
transformed by giving one of these switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flip horizontal <br>
Mirror image horizontally (left-right).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flip vertical <br>
Mirror image vertically (top-bottom).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate 90 <br>
Rotate image 90 degrees clockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate 180 <br>
Rotate image 180 degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate 270 <br>
Rotate image 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 ccw).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transpose <br>
Transpose image (across UL-to-LR axis).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transverse <br>
Transverse transpose (across UR-to-LL axis).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transpose transformation has
no restrictions regarding image dimensions. The other
transformations operate rather oddly if the image dimensions
are not a multiple of the <br>
iMCU size (usually 8 or 16 pixels), because they can only
transform complete blocks of DCT coefficient data in the
desired way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtran&rsquo;s default
behavior when transforming an odd-size image is designed to
preserve exact reversibility and mathematical consistency of
the transformation set. As stated, <br>
transpose is able to flip the entire image area. Horizontal
mirroring leaves any partial iMCU column at the right edge
untouched, but is able to flip all rows of the image. <br>
Similarly, vertical mirroring leaves any partial iMCU row at
the bottom edge untouched, but is able to flip all columns.
The other transforms can be built up as sequences of <br>
transpose and flip operations; for consistency, their
actions on edge pixels are defined to be the same as the end
result of the corresponding transpose-and-flip sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For practical use, you may
prefer to discard any untransformable edge pixels rather
than having a strange-looking strip along the right and/or
bottom edges of a transformed <br>
image. To do this, add the -trim switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trim Drop non-transformable
edge blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, a transformation with
-trim is not reversible, so strictly speaking jpegtran with
this switch is not lossless. Also, the expected mathematical
equivalences <br>
between the transformations no longer hold. For example,
-rot 270 -trim trims only the bottom edge, but -rot 90 -trim
followed by -rot 180 -trim trims both edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-perfect <br>
If you are only interested in perfect transformations, add
the -perfect switch. This causes jpegtran to fail with an
error if the transformation is not perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you may want to
do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(jpegtran -rot 90 -perfect
foo.jpg || djpeg foo.jpg | pnmflip -r90 | cjpeg)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to do a perfect rotation, if
available, or an approximated one if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crop WxH+X+Y <br>
Crop the image to a rectangular region of width W and height
H, starting at point X,Y. The lossless crop feature discards
data outside of a given image region but loss&acirc; <br>
lessly preserves what is inside. Like the rotate and flip
transforms, lossless crop is restricted by the current JPEG
format; the upper left corner of the selected region <br>
must fall on an iMCU boundary. If it doesn&rsquo;t, then it
is silently moved up and/or left to the nearest iMCU
boundary (the lower right corner is unchanged.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other not-strictly-lossless
transformation switches are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grayscale <br>
Force grayscale output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option discards the
chrominance channels if the input image is YCbCr (ie, a
standard color JPEG), resulting in a grayscale JPEG file.
The luminance channel is pre&acirc; <br>
served exactly, so this is a better method of reducing to
grayscale than decompression, conversion, and recompression.
This switch is particularly handy for fixing a <br>
monochrome picture that was mistakenly encoded as a color
JPEG. (In such a case, the space savings from getting rid of
the near-empty chroma channels won&rsquo;t be large; but
<br>
the decoding time for a grayscale JPEG is substantially less
than that for a color JPEG.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtran also recognizes these
switches that control what to do with &quot;extra&quot;
markers, such as comment blocks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy none <br>
Copy no extra markers from source file. This setting
suppresses all comments and other excess baggage present in
the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy comments <br>
Copy only comment markers. This setting copies comments from
the source file but discards any other data that is
inessential for image display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copy all <br>
Copy all extra markers. This setting preserves miscellaneous
markers found in the source file, such as JFIF thumbnails,
Exif data, and Photoshop settings. In some files, <br>
these extra markers can be sizable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior is -copy
comments. (Note: in IJG releases v6 and v6a, jpegtran always
did the equivalent of -copy none.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional switches recognized
by jpegtran are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxmemory N <br>
Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing large
images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes
if &quot;M&quot; is attached to the number. For example,
<br>
-max 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If more space is needed,
temporary files will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outfile name <br>
Send output image to the named file, not to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Enable debug printout. More -v&rsquo;s give more output.
Also, version information is printed at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Same as -verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example converts a baseline JPEG file to progressive
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtran -progressive foo.jpg
&gt; fooprog.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example rotates an image 90
degrees clockwise, discarding any unrotatable edge
pixels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpegtran -rot 90 -trim foo.jpg
&gt; foo90.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
JPEGMEM <br>
If this environment variable is set, its value is the
default memory limit. The value is specified as described
for the -maxmemory switch. JPEGMEM overrides the default
<br>
value specified when the program was compiled, and itself is
overridden by an explicit -maxmemory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The transform options can&rsquo;t transform odd-size images
perfectly. Use -trim or -perfect if you don&rsquo;t like the
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entire image is read into
memory and then written out again, even in cases where this
isn&rsquo;t really necessary. Expect swapping on large
images, especially when using the more <br>
complex transform options.</p>
