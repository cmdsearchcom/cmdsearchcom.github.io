<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aa - astronomical almanac - calculate planet and star
positions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The aa program computes the orbital positions of planetary
bodies and performs rigorous coordinate reductions to
apparent geocentric and topocentric place (local altitude
and <br>
azimuth). It also reduces star catalogue positions given in
either the FK4 or FK5 system. Data for the 57 navigational
stars is included. Most of the algorithms employed are <br>
from The Astronomical Almanac (AA) published by the U.S.
Government Printing Office.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The aa program follows the
rigorous algorithms for reduction of celestial coordinates
exactly as laid out in current editions of the Astronomical
Almanac. The reduction to <br>
apparent geocentric place has been checked by a special
version of the program (aa200) that takes planetary
positions directly from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory DE200
numerical <br>
integration of the solar system. The results agree exactly
with the Astronomical Almanac tables from 1987 onward
(earlier Almanacs used slightly different reduction
methods).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialization <br>
The following items will be read in automatically from the
first of these files to be found: ./aa.ini, ~/.aa.ini,
/etc/aa.ini. The file contains one ASCII string number per
line <br>
so is easily edited. A sample initialization file is
supplied. The entries are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lon Terrestrial longitude of
observer, degrees East of Greenwich</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lat Geodetic latitude of
observer (program calculates geocentric latitude)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">height Height above sea level,
meters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">temp Atmospheric temperature,
degrees Centigrade</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pressure <br>
Atmospheric pressure, millibars</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tflag Input time type: 1 = TDT,
2 = UT, 0 = TDT set equal to UT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deltaT Value to use for deltaT,
seconds; if 0 then the program will compute it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orbit Computations <br>
Several methods of calculating the positions of the planets
have been provided for in the program source code. These
range in accuracy from a built-in computation using
per&acirc; <br>
turbation formulae to a solution from precise orbital
elements that you supply from an almanac. <br>
The program uses as a default a set of trigonometric
expansions for the position of the Earth and planets. These
have been adjusted to match the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory&rsquo;s <br>
DE404 Long Ephemeris (1995) with a precision ranging from
about 0.1&quot; for the Earth to 1&quot; for Pluto. The
adjustment was carried out on the interval from 3000 B.C. to
3000 A.D. for <br>
the outer planets. The adjustment for the inner planets is
strictly valid only from 1350 B.C. to 3000 A.D., but may be
used to 3000 B.C. with some loss of precision. See <br>
/usr/share/doc/aa/readme.404 for additional information. The
true accuracy of positions calculated for prehistoric or
future dates is of course unknown. <br>
The Moon&rsquo;s position is calculated by a modified
version of the lunar theory of Chapront-Touze&rsquo; and
Chapront. This has a precision of 0.5 arc second relative to
DE404 for all <br>
dates between 1369 B.C. and 3000 A.D. The real position of
the Moon in ancient times is not actually known this
accurately, due to uncertainty in the tidal acceleration of
the <br>
Moon&rsquo;s orbit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of an
interpolated polynomial ephemeris such as the DE200, the
highest accuracy for current planetary positions is achieved
by using the heliocentric orbital <br>
elements that are published in the Astronomical Almanac. If
precise orbital elements are provided for the desired epoch
then the apparent place should be found to agree very <br>
closely with Almanac tabulations. <br>
Entering 99 for the planet number generates a prompt for the
name of a file containing human-readable ASCII strings
specifying the elements of orbits. The items in the
speci&acirc; <br>
fication are (see also the example file orbit.cat):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First line of entry: <br>
epoch of orbital elements (Julian date) <br>
inclination <br>
longitude of the ascending node <br>
argument of the perihelion <br>
mean distance (semimajor axis) in au <br>
daily motion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second line of entry: <br>
eccentricity <br>
mean anomaly <br>
epoch of equinox and ecliptic, Julian date <br>
visual magnitude B(1,0) at 1au from earth and sun <br>
equatorial semidiameter at 1au, arc seconds <br>
name of the object, up to 15 characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Angles in the above are in
degrees except as noted. Several sample orbits are supplied
in the file orbit.cat. If you read in an orbit named
&quot;Earth&quot; the program will install the <br>
Earth orbit, then loop back and ask for an orbit number
again. <br>
The entry for daily motion is optional. It will be
calculated by the program if it is set equal to 0.0 in your
catalogue. Almanac values of daily motion recognize the
nonzero <br>
mass of the orbiting planet; the program&rsquo;s calculation
will assume the mass is zero. <br>
Mean distance, for an elliptical orbit, is the length of the
semi-major axis of the ellipse. If the eccentricity is given
to be 1.0, the orbit is parabolic and the &quot;mean
dis&acirc; <br>
tance&quot; item is taken to be the perihelion distance.
Similarly a hyperbolic orbit has eccentricity &gt; 1.0 and
&quot;mean distance&quot; is again interpreted to mean
perihelion distance. In <br>
both these cases, the &quot;epoch&quot; is the perihelion
date, and the mean anomaly is set to 0.0 in your catalogue.
<br>
Elliptical cometary orbits are usually catalogued in terms
of perihelion distance also, but you must convert this to
mean distance to be understood by the program. Use the
for&acirc; <br>
mula</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mean distance = perihelion
distance / (1 - eccentricity)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to calculate the value to be
entered in your catalogue for an elliptical orbit. <br>
The epoch of the orbital elements refers particularly to the
date to which the given mean anomaly applies. Published data
for comets often give the time of perihelion passage <br>
as a calendar date and fraction of a day in Ephemeris Time.
To translate this into a Julian date for your catalogue
entry, run aa, type in the published date and decimal
frac&acirc; <br>
tion of a day, and note the displayed Julian date. This is
the correct Julian Ephemeris Date of the epoch for your
catalogue entry. Example (Sky &amp; Telescope, March 1991,
page <br>
297): Comet Levy 1990c had a perihelion date given as 1990
Oct 24.68664 ET. As you are prompted separately for the
year, month, and day, enter 1990, 10, 24.68664 into the
pro&acirc; <br>
gram. This date and fraction translates to JED
2448189.18664. For comparison purposes, note that published
ephemerides for comets usually give astrometric positions,
not appar&acirc; <br>
ent positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ephemeris Time and Other Time
Scales <br>
Exercise care about time scales when comparing results
against an almanac. The orbit program assumes input date is
Ephemeris Time (ET or TDT). Topocentric altitude and <br>
azimuth are calculated from Universal Time (UT). The program
converts between the two as required, but you must indicate
whether your input entry is TDT or UT. This is done by <br>
the entry for input time type in aa.ini. If you are
comparing positions against almanac values, you probably
want TDT. If you are looking up at the sky, you probably
want UT. <br>
Ephemeris transit times can be obtained by declaring TDT =
UT. The adjustment for deltaT = ET minus UT is accurate for
the years 1620 through 2011, as the complete tabulation <br>
from the Astronomical Almanac is included in the program.
Outside this range of years, approximate formulas are used
to estimate deltaT. These formulas are based on analyses of
<br>
eclipse records going back to ancient times (Stephenson and
Houlden, 1986; Borkowski, 1988) but they do not predict
future values very accurately. For precise calculations, you
<br>
should update the table in deltat.c from the current
year&rsquo;s Almanac. Note the civil time of day is UTC,
which is adjusted by integral leap seconds to be within 0.9
second of UT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated deltaT values and
predictions can be obtained from this network archive:
http://maia.usno.navy.mil . See the file deltat.c for
additional information. In addition, <br>
the IAU has adopted several other definitions of time, but
this program does not distinguish among them. The
International Earth Rotation Service is in charge of UT.
Precise <br>
data on Earth rotation and orientation are published in the
IERS bulletins, available at the IERS computer site
www.iers.org as well as at the usno site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rise and Set Times <br>
Each calculation of the time of local rising, meridian
transit, and setting includes a first order correction for
the motion in right ascension and declination of the object
<br>
between the entered input time and the time of the event.
Even so, the calculation has to be iterated, or repeated
with successively closer estimates of the event time. In
view <br>
of the first order correction the iteration has a
second-order convergence characteristic and arrives at a
precise result in just two or three steps. On the other
hand, the <br>
technique used is unstable for nearly-circumpolar objects,
such as the Moon observed at high latitudes. Thus a failure
to report rise and set times does not necessarily mean <br>
that there was no rise or set event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program reports the transit
that is nearest to the input time. Rise and set times
ordinarily precede and follow the transit. Check the date
displayed next to the rise, <br>
set, or transit time to be sure the results are for the
desired date and not for the previous or next calendar day.
For the Sun and Moon, rise and set times are for the upper
<br>
limb of the disc; but the indicated topocentric altitude
always refers to the center of the disc. The computed event
times include the effects of diurnal aberration and
paral&acirc; <br>
lax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Age of the Moon, in days from
the nearest Quarter, also has a correction for orbital
motion, but does not get the benefit of iterative
improvement and may be off by 0.1 day <br>
(the stated Quarter is always correct, however). The
estimated time can be made much more precise by entering the
input date and time of day to be near the time of the event.
In <br>
other words, the rigorous calculation requires iterating on
the time; in this case the program does not do so
automatically, hence if you want maximum accuracy you must
do the <br>
iteration by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stars <br>
Positions and proper motions of the 57 navigational stars
were taken from the Fifth Fundamental Catalogue (FK5). They
are in the file /usr/share/aa/star.cat. For all of <br>
these, the program&rsquo;s output of astrometric position
agreed with the 1986 AA to the precision of the AA
tabulation (an arc second). The same is true for 1950 FK4
positions taken <br>
from the SAO catalogue. The program agrees to 0.01&quot;
with worked examples presented in the AA. Spot checks
against Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars confirm the
mean place <br>
agreement to &lt;0.1&quot;. The APFS uses an older nutation
series, so direct comparison of apparent place is difficult.
The program incorporates the complete IAU Theory of Nutation
<br>
(1980). Items for the Messier catalogue,
/usr/share/aa/messier.cat, are from either the AA or Sky
Catalogue 2000. <br>
To compute a star&rsquo;s apparent position, its motion
since the catalogue epoch is taken into account as well as
the changes due to precession of the equatorial coordinate
system. <br>
Star catalogue files have the following data structure. Each
star entry occupies one line of ASCII characters. Numbers
can be in any usual decimal computer format and are
sepa&acirc; <br>
rated from each other by one or more spaces. From the
beginning of the line, the parameters are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Epoch of catalogue coordinates

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has the following

2.02 ;magnitude <br>
alUMi(Polaris) ;abbreviated name for alpha Ursae Minoris
(Polaris)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard abbreviations for 88
constellation names are expanded into spelled-out form (see
constel.c). The program accepts two types of catalogue
coordinates. If the epoch is <br>
given as 1950, the entire entry is interpreted as an FK4
item. The program then automatically converts the data to
the FK5 system. All other epochs are interpreted as being in
<br>
the FK5 system. <br>
Note that catalogue (and AA) star coordinates are referred
to the center of the solar system, whereas the program
displays the correct geocentric direction of the object. The
<br>
maximum difference is 0.8&quot; in the case of alpha
Centauri.</p>
