<b>aa</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>aa</b> program computes the orbital positions of planetary bodies and
  performs rigorous coordinate reductions to apparent geocentric and topocentric
  place (local altitude and azimuth). It also reduces star catalogue positions
  given in either the FK4 or FK5 system. Data for the 57 navigational stars is
  included. Most of the algorithms employed are from The Astronomical Almanac
  (AA) published by the U.S. Government Printing Office.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>aa</b> program follows the rigorous algorithms for reduction of celestial
  coordinates exactly as laid out in current editions of the Astronomical
  Almanac. The reduction to apparent geocentric place has been checked by a
  special version of the program (aa200) that takes planetary positions directly
  from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory DE200 numerical integration of the solar
  system. The results agree exactly with the Astronomical Almanac tables from
  1987 onward (earlier Almanacs used slightly different reduction methods).

<br/>
 Several methods of calculating the positions of the planets have been provided
  for in the program source code. These range in accuracy from a built-in
  computation using perturbation formulae to a solution from precise orbital
  elements that you supply from an almanac.
<br/>
 The program uses as a default a set of trigonometric expansions for the
  position of the Earth and planets. These have been adjusted to match the Jet
  Propulsion Laboratory's DE404 Long Ephemeris (1995) with a precision ranging
  from about 0.1&quot; for the Earth to 1&quot; for Pluto. The adjustment was
  carried out on the interval from 3000 B.C. to 3000 A.D. for the outer planets.
  The adjustment for the inner planets is strictly valid only from 1350 B.C. to
  3000 A.D., but may be used to 3000 B.C. with some loss of precision. See
  <i>/usr/share/doc/aa/readme.404</i> for additional information. The true
  accuracy of positions calculated for prehistoric or future dates is of course
  unknown.
<br/>
 The Moon's position is calculated by a modified version of the lunar theory of
  Chapront-Touze' and Chapront. This has a precision of 0.5 arc second relative
  to DE404 for all dates between 1369 B.C. and 3000 A.D. The real position of
  the Moon in ancient times is not actually known this accurately, due to
  uncertainty in the tidal acceleration of the Moon's orbit.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 In the absence of an interpolated polynomial ephemeris such as the DE200, the
  highest accuracy for current planetary positions is achieved by using the
  heliocentric orbital elements that are published in the Astronomical Almanac.
  If precise orbital elements are provided for the desired epoch then the
  apparent place should be found to agree very closely with Almanac tabulations.
<br/>
 Entering 99 for the planet number generates a prompt for the name of a file
  containing human-readable ASCII strings specifying the elements of orbits. The
  items in the specification are (see also the example file orbit.cat):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
   First line of entry:
epoch of orbital elements (Julian date)
inclination
longitude of the ascending node
argument of the perihelion
mean distance (semimajor axis) in au
daily motion
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
   Second line of entry:
eccentricity
mean anomaly
epoch of equinox and ecliptic, Julian date
visual magnitude B(1,0) at 1au from earth and sun
equatorial semidiameter at 1au, arc seconds
name of the object, up to 15 characters
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Angles in the above are in degrees except as noted. Several sample orbits are
  supplied in the file orbit.cat. If you read in an orbit named
  &quot;Earth&quot; the program will install the Earth orbit, then loop back and
  ask for an orbit number again.
<br/>
 The entry for daily motion is optional. It will be calculated by the program if
  it is set equal to 0.0 in your catalogue. Almanac values of daily motion
  recognize the nonzero mass of the orbiting planet; the program's calculation
  will assume the mass is zero.
<br/>
 Mean distance, for an elliptical orbit, is the length of the semi-major axis of
  the ellipse. If the eccentricity is given to be 1.0, the orbit is parabolic
  and the &quot;mean distance&quot; item is taken to be the perihelion distance.
  Similarly a hyperbolic orbit has eccentricity &gt; 1.0 and &quot;mean
  distance&quot; is again interpreted to mean perihelion distance. In both these
  cases, the &quot;epoch&quot; is the perihelion date, and the mean anomaly is
  set to 0.0 in your catalogue.
<br/>
 Elliptical cometary orbits are usually catalogued in terms of perihelion
  distance also, but you must convert this to mean distance to be understood by
  the program. Use the formula
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 mean distance = perihelion distance / (1 - eccentricity)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
to calculate the value to be entered in your catalogue for an elliptical orbit.
<br/>
 The epoch of the orbital elements refers particularly to the date to which the
  given mean anomaly applies. Published data for comets often give the time of
  perihelion passage as a calendar date and fraction of a day in Ephemeris Time.
  To translate this into a Julian date for your catalogue entry, run <b>aa</b>,
  type in the published date and decimal fraction of a day, and note the
  displayed Julian date. This is the correct Julian Ephemeris Date of the epoch
  for your catalogue entry. Example (Sky &amp; Telescope, March 1991, page 297):
  Comet Levy 1990c had a perihelion date given as 1990 Oct 24.68664 ET. As you
  are prompted separately for the year, month, and day, enter 1990, 10, 24.68664
  into the program. This date and fraction translates to JED 2448189.18664. For
  comparison purposes, note that published ephemerides for comets usually give
  astrometric positions, not apparent positions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Ephemeris_Time_and_Other_Time_Scales"><a class="selflink" href="#Ephemeris_Time_and_Other_Time_Scales">Ephemeris
  Time and Other Time Scales</a></h1>
<br/>
 Exercise care about time scales when comparing results against an almanac. The
  orbit program assumes input date is Ephemeris Time (ET or TDT). Topocentric
  altitude and azimuth are calculated from Universal Time (UT). The program
  converts between the two as required, but you must indicate whether your input
  entry is TDT or UT. This is done by the entry for input time type in aa.ini.
  If you are comparing positions against almanac values, you probably want TDT.
  If you are looking up at the sky, you probably want UT. Ephemeris transit
  times can be obtained by declaring TDT = UT. The adjustment for deltaT = ET
  minus UT is accurate for the years 1620 through 2011, as the complete
  tabulation from the Astronomical Almanac is included in the program. Outside
  this range of years, approximate formulas are used to estimate deltaT. These
  formulas are based on analyses of eclipse records going back to ancient times
  (Stephenson and Houlden, 1986; Borkowski, 1988) but they do not predict future
  values very accurately. For precise calculations, you should update the table
  in deltat.c from the current year's Almanac. Note the civil time of day is
  UTC, which is adjusted by integral leap seconds to be within 0.9 second of UT.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Updated deltaT values and predictions can be obtained from this network
  archive: http://maia.usno.navy.mil . See the file deltat.c for additional
  information. In addition, the IAU has adopted several other definitions of
  time, but this program does not distinguish among them. The International
  Earth Rotation Service is in charge of UT. Precise data on Earth rotation and
  orientation are published in the IERS bulletins, available at the IERS
  computer site www.iers.org as well as at the usno site.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Rise_and_Set_Times"><a class="selflink" href="#Rise_and_Set_Times">Rise
  and Set Times</a></h1>
<br/>
 Each calculation of the time of local rising, meridian transit, and setting
  includes a first order correction for the motion in right ascension and
  declination of the object between the entered input time and the time of the
  event. Even so, the calculation has to be iterated, or repeated with
  successively closer estimates of the event time. In view of the first order
  correction the iteration has a second-order convergence characteristic and
  arrives at a precise result in just two or three steps. On the other hand, the
  technique used is unstable for nearly-circumpolar objects, such as the Moon
  observed at high latitudes. Thus a failure to report rise and set times does
  not necessarily mean that there was no rise or set event.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 The program reports the transit that is nearest to the input time. Rise and set
  times ordinarily precede and follow the transit. Check the date displayed next
  to the rise, set, or transit time to be sure the results are for the desired
  date and not for the previous or next calendar day. For the Sun and Moon, rise
  and set times are for the upper limb of the disc; but the indicated
  topocentric altitude always refers to the center of the disc. The computed
  event times include the effects of diurnal aberration and parallax.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Age of the Moon, in days from the nearest Quarter, also has a correction for
  orbital motion, but does not get the benefit of iterative improvement and may
  be off by 0.1 day (the stated Quarter is always correct, however). The
  estimated time can be made much more precise by entering the input date and
  time of day to be near the time of the event. In other words, the rigorous
  calculation requires iterating on the time; in this case the program does not
  do so automatically, hence if you want maximum accuracy you must do the
  iteration by hand.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Stars"><a class="selflink" href="#Stars">Stars</a></h1>
<br/>
 Positions and proper motions of the 57 navigational stars were taken from the
  Fifth Fundamental Catalogue (FK5). They are in the file
  <i>/usr/share/aa/star.cat</i>. For all of these, the program's output of
  astrometric position agreed with the 1986 AA to the precision of the AA
  tabulation (an arc second). The same is true for 1950 FK4 positions taken from
  the SAO catalogue. The program agrees to 0.01&quot; with worked examples
  presented in the AA. Spot checks against Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars
  confirm the mean place agreement to &lt;0.1&quot;. The APFS uses an older
  nutation series, so direct comparison of apparent place is difficult. The
  program incorporates the complete IAU Theory of Nutation (1980). Items for the
  Messier catalogue, <i>/usr/share/aa/messier.cat</i>, are from either the AA or
  Sky Catalogue 2000.
<br/>
 To compute a star's apparent position, its motion since the catalogue epoch is
  taken into account as well as the changes due to precession of the equatorial
  coordinate system. Star catalogue files have the following data structure.
  Each star entry occupies one line of ASCII characters. Numbers can be in any
  usual decimal computer format and are separated from each other by one or more
  spaces. From the beginning of the line, the parameters are
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
Epoch of catalogue coordinates and equinox
Right ascension, hours
Right ascension, minutes
Right ascension, seconds
Declination, degrees

Declination, seconds
Proper motion in R.A., s/century
Proper motion in Dec., &quot;/century

</div>
For example, the line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
has the following interpretation:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>

</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Standard abbreviations for 88 constellation names are expanded into spelled-out
  form (see constel.c). The program accepts two types of catalogue coordinates.
  If the epoch is given as 1950, the entire entry is interpreted as an FK4 item.
  The program then automatically converts the data to the FK5 system. All other
  epochs are interpreted as being in the FK5 system.
<br/>
 Note that catalogue (and AA) star coordinates are referred to the center of the
  solar system, whereas the program displays the correct geocentric direction of
  the object. The maximum difference is 0.8&quot; in the case of alpha Centauri.
