<p>flwm(1) General Commands Manual flwm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
flwm - The Fast Light Window Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
flwm [-d[isplay] host:n.n] [-g[eometry] WxH+X+Y] [-fg color]
[-bg color] [-bg2 color]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
flwm is a very small and fast X window manager, featuring no
icons and &quot;sideways&quot; title bars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run flwm as your login
script, you need to create or replace ~/.xinitrc or
~/.xsession (or both). Newer Linux systems with a login
panel use .xsession, older systems where X <br>
was started after login use .xinitrc. You may also have to
pick &quot;default&quot; from the &quot;type of
session&quot; popup in your login window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .xinitrc or .xsession file
should look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
xsetroot -solid xrdb .Xresources <br>
# xset, xmodmap, other configuration programs <br>
flwm &amp; <br>
WindowManager=$! <br>
# xterm, other automatically-launched programs <br>
wait $WindowManager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SWITCHES <br>
-d[isplay] host:#.# Sets the display and screen for flwm to
manage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[isual] # Visual number to use
(probably only works for non-color-mapped ones)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g[eometry] WxH+X+Y Flwm will
act as though the screen is only the specified area. It will
constrain initial window positions to this area and stop
them at the edges when drag&acirc; <br>
ging them around. This can be used to surround the screen
with fixed &quot;toolbars&quot; that are never covered by
windows. These toolbars must be created by a program using
over&acirc; <br>
ride-redirect so that flwm does not try to move them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m[aximum] WxH Set the size of
windows when the maximize buttons are pushed. Normally this
is the size of the screen. This is useful for XFree86
servers that are run with a <br>
smaller screen than display memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The menu will say
&quot;Exit&quot; instead of &quot;Logout&quot; and will not
ask for confirmation. This is a good idea if you are running
flwm in some other way than with exec at the end of <br>
.xinitrc, since it won&rsquo;t log you out then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg color, -bg color Set the
label color and the color of the window frames and the
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[ursor] # What cursor to use
on the desktop (you will have to experiment to find out what
each number means)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfg color, -cbg color Colors
for the desktop and window resizing cursors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to these switches
there is much customization that can be done by editing the
config.h file in the source code and recompiling. GCC is
your friend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU ITEMS <br>
Flwm can launch programs from its menu. This is controlled
by files in the directory ~/.wmx (this was chosen to be
compatible with wmx and wm2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each executable file in ~/.wmx
is a program to run. Usually these are symbolic links to the
real program or very short shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each subdirectory creates a
child menu so you can build a hierarchy (up to 10 deep).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut and paste the following
lines you your shell to create some example files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir ~/.wmx <br>
ln -s /usr/bin/gimp ~/.wmx/&quot;The Gimp&quot; <br>
cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; ~/.wmx/&quot;Terminal&quot; <br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
/usr/bin/rxvt -ut <br>
EOF <br>
chmod +x !*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Debian, flwm has been
modified to support a system-wide menu /var/lib/flwm/wmx
when no ~/.wmx exists, and scripts were added to take
advantage of the Debian menu system (see <br>
update-menus(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUSE USAGE <br>
Left-click on a window border raises window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left-drag will move the window
when in the title bar, and will resize it in the edges. If
the window cannot be resized then it will always move the
window. What it will do is <br>
indicated by the cursor shape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Middle-click on a window border
lowers it to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Middle-drag anywhere on window
border will move the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you move a window it will
stop at the edges of the screen. Dragging about 150 pixels
further will unstick it and let you drag it off the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right-click on a window border
pops up the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any button on the desktop will
pop up the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUTTONS <br>
The empty button &quot;iconizes&quot; the window: it will
completely vanish. To get it back use the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vertical-bar button
&quot;shades&quot; (or &quot;Venetian blinds&quot;?) the
window. Click it again to restore the window. You can also
resize the shaded window to a new height or &quot;open&quot;
it by <br>
resizing horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two buttons below it toggle
maximum height and/or maximum width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X button at the bottom
closes the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU <br>
Right-click on window border, or any-click on the desktop,
or typing Alt+Esc or Alt+Tab or Alt+Shift+Tab will pop up
the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Releasing Alt will pick the
current menu item. This makes flwm work very much (exactly?)
like the Windows 95 shortcuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each main window is a menu item.
If the window is &quot;iconized&quot; the little picture
shows an open rectangle, otherwise it shows a filled
rectangle. Picking a menu item deiconizes <br>
and raises that window and warps the pointer so it is
current.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New desktop asks for a name of a
new desktop and makes it current. The desktop will initially
be empty (except for sticky items).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To move windows to the current
desktop, pop up the menu and pick windows off of other
desktops (if using the keyboard, use left arrow to go to the
desktop names, move up and down <br>
to the other desktop, and use right arrow to enter that
desktop). The window will be moved from the other desktop to
the current one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To switch to another desktop,
pick the title of the desktop (if using the keyboard, use
left arrow to go to the desktop names, move up and down to
the other desktop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a desktop is empty you can
delete it. Its sub menu will show delete this desktop. Pick
that and the desktop is gone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sticky is a special
&quot;desktop&quot;: windows on it appear on all desktops.
To make a window &quot;sticky&quot; switch to the Sticky
desktop and pick the window off its current desktop (thus
<br>
&quot;moving&quot; it to the Sticky desktop). To
&quot;unstick&quot; a window go to another desktop and pick
the window off the sticky desktop menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New xterm will run a new xterm
on the current desktop. Useful if you accidentally close
everything. This item does not appear if a ~/.wmx directory
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logout will ask for confirmation
and if so flwm will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit will exit flwm without
confirmation. This item will appear if flwm was run with the
-x switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOT KEYS <br>
These are the defaults, the hot keys may be different
depending on how flwm was compiled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Escape Pops up the menu with
the current window preselected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Tab Pops up the menu with
the next window preselected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Shift+Tab Pops up the menu
with the previous window preselected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Tab Switch to the next
desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Shift+Tab Switch to the
previous desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Function key Switch to
desktop N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Up Raise the current
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Down Lower the current
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Delete Close the current
window (same as clicking close box).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Enter &quot;Iconizes&quot;
(hides) the current window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It is impossible to move windows smaller than 100 pixels off
the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only obeys &quot;keep
aspect&quot; if the aspect ratio is 1x1.</p>
