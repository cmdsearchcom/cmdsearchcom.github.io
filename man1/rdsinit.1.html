rdsinit is a utility that constructs an initialized RDS heap in an RVM segment.
  It is intended to create a structure that can be loaded by rds_load_heap.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three different ways of using rdsinit. General users are expected to
  use first two interactive modes, where users may supply parameters for the rds
  heap interactively or on command line arguments. However, in both cases, users
  will be asked interactively to confirm their choice of parameters before
  rdsinit goes ahead to make any permanent change. These are the preferred modes
  of using rdsinit. Script writers, however, may prefer to supply all the
  parameters on the command line and <i>no</i> confirmation required for those
  parameters. This is accomodate in the third mode where an additional switch of
  -f (firm) is supplied on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In any case, two command-line parameters are always required: log and data_seg.
  The former is the name of the RVM log, which must have previously been
  initialized by rvmutl; the latter is the name of the data segment that will be
  initialized with an RDS heap. If either is missing, a command line error is
  printed. If the log has not been initialized, an RVM error will result. A
  short message indicating RVM initialization succeeded is then printed. Both
  the log and data segment can be regular files or raw partitions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the name of log and data segment, there are six other numeric parameters
  required. They are summarized here and will be explained one by one in the
  following paragraphs:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">datalen</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Length of data segment</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">saddr</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Starting address of rvm</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">hlen</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Heap region length</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">slen</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Static region length</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">nl</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Number of lists of free block</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">chunk</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Chunk size</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While entering these six numeric parameters, either on command line on via the
  interactive prompt, users may use numeric number in hexadecimal, decimal or
  even octal notation. Hexadecimal numbers are preceeded by Ox, decimal numbers
  are preceeded by nothing and octal numbers are preceded by 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special note for long time rdsinit user: the old rdsinit automatically assumed
  saddr, hlen and slen parameters supplied on command lines are in hexidecimal
  and <i>did not</i> require the prefix 0x. <i>This is no longer true with this
  version of rdsinit.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Users specify the length of the data segment with the parameter <i>datalen</i>.
  Again, old version of rdsinit did not require this parameter if the data
  segment was a regular file and it existed already at the time of running
  rdsinit. This special case is eliminated: <i>length of data segment must to be
  supplied in all</i> <i>circumstances.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Starting address of rvm, or <i>saddr</i>, is where heap and static region will
  be mapped into virtual memory. Heap region is located right at the starting
  address, while static region is located at starting address plus heap region
  length. Users may need to have some knowledges of the overall layout of the
  virtual memory use by the system before they can make the right choice of
  starting address. For example, the starting address of rvm must be much larger
  than the largest possible break point of your application, and it should not
  be in conflict other uses of virtual memory (such as use by shared libraries).
  It must also be on a page boundary. In CMU, we use 0x20000000 (536870912) with
  Linux and BSD44, or 0x70000000 (1879048192) with Mach. It is possible to
  choose other values, but you have to choose them carefully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Length of regions of heap and static are specified by the parameter <i>hlen</i>
  and <i>slen</i> respectively. They both must be integral multiple of pagesize
  of the system. Also, the combined length of the two regions must be smaller
  than the length of data segment minus one extra page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the above three parameters: saddr, hlen, slen, are permanent. They
  can't be changed without re-initizing (and brain-wiping) the data segment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next two parameters: <i>nl</i> and <i>chunk</i> are related to underlying
  structure of management of the heap. RDS uses the Quick Fit method for heap
  allocation. In this method, free blocks are maintained by a number of free
  lists, each list for one particular size of free blocks. Specifically, there
  will be nl free lists, and each of them will have free blocks of size 1..nl
  chunk respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Chunk size must be integral multiple of sizeof(char *), and be at least
  RDS_MIN_CHUNK_SIZE. Number of lists must be at least RDS_MIN_FREE_LISTS. For
  example, a reasonable choice is to have 100 free list with chunk size 32
  bytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once all the parameters are chosen, rdsinit will ask user for confirmation
  before it goes ahead and make permanent change on the log and data segment.
  Note in the following example that those numerical arguments are presented in
  both hexidecimal and decimal (in bracket). It is safe to quit at this point
  and no permanent changes will be made.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
The following parameters are chosen:
   length of data segment:    0xf5000 (   1003520)
  starting address of rvm: 0x20000000 ( 536870912)
                 heap len:    0xf0000 (    983040)
               static len:     0x4000 (     16384)
                   nlists:       0x64 (       100)
               chunk size:       0x20 (        32)
Do you agree with these parameters  (y|n|q) y
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If user supplied the -f (firm) switch on command line, this last confirmation
  will not show up.
