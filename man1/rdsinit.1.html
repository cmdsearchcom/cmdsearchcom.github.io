<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rdsinit - RDS heap initialization utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rdsinit log data_seg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdsinit log data_seg datalen
saddr hlen slen nl chunk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdsinit -f log data_seg datalen
saddr hlen slen nl chunk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rdsinit is a utility that constructs an initialized RDS heap
in an RVM segment. It is intended to create a structure that
can be loaded by rds_load_heap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three different ways
of using rdsinit. General users are expected to use first
two interactive modes, where users may supply parameters for
the rds heap interactively <br>
or on command line arguments. However, in both cases, users
will be asked interactively to confirm their choice of
parameters before rdsinit goes ahead to make any permanent
<br>
change. These are the preferred modes of using rdsinit.
Script writers, however, may prefer to supply all the
parameters on the command line and no confirmation required
for <br>
those parameters. This is accomodate in the third mode where
an additional switch of -f (firm) is supplied on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any case, two command-line
parameters are always required: log and data_seg. The former
is the name of the RVM log, which must have previously been
initialized by rvmutl; the <br>
latter is the name of the data segment that will be
initialized with an RDS heap. If either is missing, a
command line error is printed. If the log has not been
initialized, an <br>
RVM error will result. A short message indicating RVM
initialization succeeded is then printed. Both the log and
data segment can be regular files or raw partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the name of log and data
segment, there are six other numeric parameters required.
They are summarized here and will be explained one by one in
the following paragraphs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datalen <br>
Length of data segment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saddr Starting address of
rvm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hlen Heap region length</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slen Static region length</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nl Number of lists of free
block</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chunk Chunk size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While entering these six numeric
parameters, either on command line on via the interactive
prompt, users may use numeric number in hexadecimal, decimal
or even octal notation. <br>
Hexadecimal numbers are preceeded by Ox, decimal numbers are
preceeded by nothing and octal numbers are preceded by
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special note for long time
rdsinit user: the old rdsinit automatically assumed saddr,
hlen and slen parameters supplied on command lines are in
hexidecimal and did not require <br>
the prefix 0x. This is no longer true with this version of
rdsinit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users specify the length of the
data segment with the parameter datalen. Again, old version
of rdsinit did not require this parameter if the data
segment was a regular file and <br>
it existed already at the time of running rdsinit. This
special case is eliminated: length of data segment must to
be supplied in all circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting address of rvm, or
saddr, is where heap and static region will be mapped into
virtual memory. Heap region is located right at the starting
address, while static region <br>
is located at starting address plus heap region length.
Users may need to have some knowledges of the overall layout
of the virtual memory use by the system before they can make
<br>
the right choice of starting address. For example, the
starting address of rvm must be much larger than the largest
possible break point of your application, and it should not
<br>
be in conflict other uses of virtual memory (such as use by
shared libraries). It must also be on a page boundary. In
CMU, we use 0x20000000 (536870912) with Linux and BSD44,
<br>
or 0x70000000 (1879048192) with Mach. It is possible to
choose other values, but you have to choose them
carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Length of regions of heap and
static are specified by the parameter hlen and slen
respectively. They both must be integral multiple of
pagesize of the system. Also, the com&acirc; <br>
bined length of the two regions must be smaller than the
length of data segment minus one extra page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the above three
parameters: saddr, hlen, slen, are permanent. They
can&rsquo;t be changed without re-initizing (and
brain-wiping) the data segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next two parameters: nl and
chunk are related to underlying structure of management of
the heap. RDS uses the Quick Fit method for heap allocation.
In this method, free <br>
blocks are maintained by a number of free lists, each list
for one particular size of free blocks. Specifically, there
will be nl free lists, and each of them will have free <br>
blocks of size 1..nl chunk respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chunk size must be integral
multiple of sizeof(char *), and be at least
RDS_MIN_CHUNK_SIZE. Number of lists must be at least
RDS_MIN_FREE_LISTS. For example, a reasonable <br>
choice is to have 100 free list with chunk size 32
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once all the parameters are
chosen, rdsinit will ask user for confirmation before it
goes ahead and make permanent change on the log and data
segment. Note in the following <br>
example that those numerical arguments are presented in both
hexidecimal and decimal (in bracket). It is safe to quit at
this point and no permanent changes will be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following parameters are
chosen: <br>
length of data segment: 0xf5000 ( 1003520) <br>
starting address of rvm: 0x20000000 ( 536870912) <br>
heap len: 0xf0000 ( 983040) <br>
static len: 0x4000 ( 16384) <br>
nlists: 0x64 ( 100) <br>
chunk size: 0x20 ( 32) <br>
Do you agree with these parameters ? (y|n|q) y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If user supplied the -f (firm)
switch on command line, this last confirmation will not show
up.</p>
