<p>PMSNAP(1) General Commands Manual PMSNAP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmsnap - generate performance summary snapshot images</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsnap [-NV] [-C dir] [-c configs] [-n
names] [-o dir] [-t type]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmsnap is a shell script that is normally run periodically
from crontab(1) to generate graphic images of pmchart(1)
performance charts. These images can be in any of the
sup&acirc; <br>
ported pmchart formats, including png, bmp, and jpeg, and
may be incorporated into the content offered by the local
Web server. The -V option enables verbose tracing of the
<br>
actions. By default pmsnap generates no output unless some
error or warning condition is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmsnap generates images
according to its control file, $PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH (or
dir/control if the -C option is specified), and uses archive
logs created by pmlogger(1) or PCP <br>
archive folios created by pmafm(1) and pmlogger_check(1).
Before attempting to configure pmsnap, it is strongly
recommended that pmlogger be configured according to the
descrip&acirc; <br>
tions in pmlogger_daily(1), pmlogger_check(1) and
pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once pmlogger has been
configured, it is necessary to configure pmsnap as
follows;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Edit the control file
$PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH. The syntax of this file is
described in the comment at the head of the file and an
example is supplied for one and twelve <br>
hour &quot;Summary&quot; performance charts for the local
host. Suitable arguments for pmchart are also described in
the comment. The user should consult pmchart for further
<br>
details. Note that when pmsnap is run, it globally
substitutes the string LOCALHOSTNAME with the name of the
local host in the control file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Test the configuration by
running <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsnap. <br>
Without any arguments pmsnap will process every non-comment
line in $PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH. The output images will be
placed in the files named in the first field of <br>
each line in the control file, with the file format appended
if necessary. If these file names do not start with / or .
then they are assumed relative to dir, as speci&acirc; <br>
fied with the -o option. The default dir is the current
directory. Note that if pmlogger has only been recently
started (within about the last 15 minutes), snap-shot <br>
images may not be produced and no error messages will be
issued - the reason is that pmchart can not use very short
archives and hence, neither can pmsnap. For debugging <br>
purposes the -V flag should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Add an appropriate entry for
pmsnap in the root user&rsquo;s crontab. An example is
supplied in $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/crontab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Incorporate the pmsnap images
into the local WWW content. Usually, WWW pages use images
that are relative to a particular document root, so it is
often convenient to use <br>
the -o command line option to specify a sub-directory of the
local WWW content, and then create a web page in this
directory that shows the snapshot images with text and <br>
other content appropriate to the local environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
pmsnap accepts the following command line options;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dir The control file is
located in the directory dir rather than in the default
$PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-pattern <br>
Only process lines in the control file which match the
config-pattern regular expression in the Config column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name-pattern <br>
Only process lines in the control file which match the
name-pattern regular expression (see egrep(1)) in the Name
column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o dir The output images having
file names which do not start with / or . will be placed in
a directory relative to dir, otherwise the output directory
is relative to the cur&acirc; <br>
rent directory (i.e. the default value for dir is ./). Note
that dir must be a writable directory path and may be on an
NFS or CIFS file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N option enables a
&lsquo;&lsquo;show me&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, where the actions
are echoed, but not executed, in the style of
&lsquo;&lsquo;make -n&rsquo;&rsquo;. Using -N in conjunction
with -V maximizes the diagnostic <br>
capabilities for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When either -n or -c are used,
pmsnap will only process lines in the control file which
match all the supplied patterns. If no patterns are given,
then all lines will be pro&acirc; <br>
cessed. These arguments allow multiple entries for pmsnap in
crontab so that different performance summary images can be
generated at different times or with different
frequen&acirc; <br>
cies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A sample HTML page, suitable for
the Summary snapshot may be found in
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmsnap/Summary.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although pmsnap attempts to
flush stdio(3) output buffers in the relevant pmlogger
processes before generating snap-shots images, this may fail
for assorted reasons and no error <br>
message will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmsnap should not be invoked
immediately after pmlogger_daily has rolled the logs because
the new archive logs will be too short to obtain meaningful
results. Note however that <br>
pmsnap will not report errors from pmchart about not being
able to comply with the -A option on very short archives. In
these cases no error will be reported and no output <br>
images will be produced.</p>
