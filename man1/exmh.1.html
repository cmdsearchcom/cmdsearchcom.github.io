<p>EXMH TOUR(1) INTRO TO EXMH EXMH TOUR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exmh - An introduction to the exmh mail user interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
This man page provides a quick tour through some of the
basic features of exmh version 2.0, which provides a
graphical user interface to the MH mail system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you read this tutorial you
should be able to use exmh for your basic daily mail reading
needs. You will learn how to send mail, read mail, manage
your messages in folders, <br>
and adjust some of the exmh features by means of its
Preferences user interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is much more documentation
available on-line through HTML pages that are viewable from
within exmh. In particular. exmh-use provides information
about using the more <br>
advanced features of exmh. If you are already an experienced
email user, you may want to just read the GETTING STARTED
section here and then skip to the exmh-use man page. <br>
exmh-custom describes how to customize exmh to suit your
needs. exmh-ref lists each button and menu entry in exmh and
explains what they do. If you are an experienced exmh <br>
user, this may be the most useful man page for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A cleaned up version of these
man pages appear in the 3rd edition of the book by Jerry
Peek, MH &amp; xmh: email for users and programmers, which
is published by O&rsquo;Reilly &amp; Asso&acirc; <br>
ciates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Web versions of the
documentation can also be found at</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.beedub.com/exmh/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
If you are already an MH or xmh user, you can start with the
examples given in this tour. If you are a new user, exmh
will set up your basic MH environment. This includes a <br>
Mail directory which will have one subdirectory for each
mail folder, plus several files that MH mail uses for its
own purposes. You also get a ~/.mh_profile file that has
user <br>
settings for MH and exmh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exmh uses the regular MH
programs to manipulate your mail folders and messages. This
means it is compatible with command-line use of MH programs,
and its actions should be <br>
familiar if you are an experienced MH user. If you are a new
MH user, then the details of running MH programs is hidden
behind the graphical interface. The MH programs used by <br>
exmh are described towards the end of this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you run exmh for the first
time it checks a few things in your MH profile. In
particular, it depends on the Draft-Folder and
Unseen-Sequence profile components. If these <br>
profile components are not present, a dialog appears and
exmh can set them up for you. If you do not let exmh create
them nor set them up by hand, exmh will not work properly.
<br>
These profile entries are described in the exmh-ref man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exmh has been designed to be
very flexible, although it will work just fine &quot;out of
the box&quot;. The Preference package used to adjust some of
the settings in exmh is introduced in <br>
this man page, and some of the important settings are
described here. A more complete guide to customizing exmh is
given in the exmh-custom man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING EXMH <br>
The command to start exmh looks like this: exmh -display
hostname:0 &amp; If your DISPLAY environment variable is set
up properly, then the -display argument is not needed, and
the <br>
command is even simpler. You do not need to specify a
-geometry argument, although exmh supports one. Instead,
simply position and size the window using your window
manager. <br>
When exmh quits, it saves the geometry information so you
don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. It does this with all
its top level windows, so you can adjust their position once
and <br>
then forget about it. There are more command line options
described in the exmh-ref man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can add the exmh command to
your startup X environment by editing your startup file
(like .xsession). You might also want to add it to the main
menu of your window manager. <br>
The details about this vary from X system to X system, so
ask your local X guru for help. Exmh also supports the
window manager session protocol, which means that
session-smart <br>
window managers will automatically start exmh for you if you
quit X when exmh is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE EXMH DISPLAY <br>
This section describes the main parts of the exmh display.
It probably makes sense to run exmh at this point so you can
follow along. There are three sets of buttons in the <br>
interface, and three main subwindows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main Buttons. Along the top of
the window is a set of buttons and menus that apply to exmh
itself. Quit, for example, quits exmh. The Help button pops
up a menu, and you can <br>
select the entries there to get more on-line information
about exmh. Use the left mouse button to select the buttons
and menus. A button will change its appearance when you <br>
press it, and it will be invoked when you release the mouse
over the button. If you slide the mouse off the button
before releasing it, nothing happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folder Display. Below the main
buttons is the folder display subwindow. It has a special
button for each of your top-level folders, and these are
called folder labels. As a <br>
new user you will see two folder labels, one for inbox and
drafts. The inbox folder is for your new messages, and the
drafts folder is for messages you are writing. If you have
<br>
used MH (or xmh) before, then you may have many more folders
that will appear in this display. The mouse bindings for
folder labels are explained in the exmh-use man page. The
<br>
Color Legend from the Help menu also tells you how the
folder labels respond to mouse clicks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folder Cache. A second folder
display called the folder cache may appear under the main
folder display. This shows the folder labels for recently
used folders. If you only <br>
have a few folders this wastes screen real estate. The
PREFERENCES section near the end of this man page explains
how to turn this off via the Folder Cache preferences
setting. <br>
If you are a first-time exmh user, Exmh tries to guess if
you need this display based on the number of folders and
nested folders you have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folder Buttons. The middle set
of buttons is for operations that apply to folders. For
example, you can create a new folder with the New button
here. The More... button dis&acirc; <br>
plays a popup menu with several more operations you can
apply to folders. Some of these buttons will be introduced
in this man page. All of these buttons and menus are <br>
explained in detail in the exmh-ref man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To the left of the folder
buttons, summary information about the current folder is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table of Contents. The middle
subwindow of the display shows a summary of the messages in
the folder. It shows the message number, the date of the
message, the subject of the <br>
message, and, space permitting, the first few words of the
message. Left click on a line in the table of contents to
view the corresponding message. The mouse bindings for the
<br>
table of contents are described in more detail in the
exmh-use man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MH experts: The display in this
window comes from both the MH scan program or MH inc
programs, so it is affected by the form specification used
by these programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color and Monochrome Highlights.
Both the folder display and table of contents windows use
highlights to give you visual clues about the state of
messages and folders. Your <br>
unread messages are highlighted in the table of contents and
the folders that contain unread message are highlighted in
the folder display. Pull down the main Help menu and <br>
select Color Legend to display a key to the highlights for
your display. The highlighting is covered in more detail
later in the exmh-use man page. The exmh-custom man page
<br>
tells how you can control the highlighting yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Line. Just below the
table of contents is the status line. This has two parts.
The left part shows the name of the folder and the message
number for the current mes&acirc; <br>
sage, if any. The right part gives feedback about what exmh
is doing. After it displays a message, the Subject component
is displayed there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subwindow Resize Diamond. The
black diamond to the right of the status line is used to
change the size of the internal windows. Press the first
mouse button on this target and <br>
a horizontal line appears. Drag it up and down to adjust the
window sizes. Try dragging it all the way to the top and
bottom of the exmh window to see how the mode changes to
<br>
adjust different windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message Buttons The bottom row
of buttons are for operations that apply to the current
message. Several of these operations will be introduced in
this man page. The right hand <br>
button labeled More... brings up a menu with several more
advanced message operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: Many of these message
operations have keyboard shortcuts that make it easy to use
exmh with your hands on the keyboard. Some of the short-cuts
are introduced in this man <br>
page, and all of them are listed in the exmh-use man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message Display. The bottom
subwindow displays the current message, if any. Some of the
less interesting mail headers start out scrolled off the top
of this window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDING MAIL <br>
A good way to test things out is to send a message to
yourself. Here are the steps you take to do that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Click the Send button, which
is in the Message buttons in the bottom group. A new window
will open that contains the template for your message. The
built-in editor, which <br>
is called sedit, will start out with the insert cursor
positioned at the end of the first empty header line. Enter
your user name after the To: header. If you want to send the
<br>
message to more than one person, use a comma to separate the
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Position the insert cursor on
the next header line. You can do this a few different ways.
The most direct way is to click the left mouse button where
you want the cursor to <br>
be. There are keyboard shortcuts, too. If you press
&lt;Tab&gt; the editor will take you to the end of the next
header line. You can also use the arrow keys or some
emacs-like bind&acirc; <br>
ings to move the cursor. &lt;Control-n&gt; goes to the next
line, &lt;Control-f&gt; moves the cursor forward a
character. &lt;Control-p&gt; moves up a line, and
&lt;Control-b&gt; moves back a charac&acirc; <br>
ter. The Simple Edit menu entry shows you all the
keybindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The next header is the Cc:
line. People listed in the Cc: line get a
&quot;courtesy&quot; (or &quot;carbon&quot;) copy of the
message. By convention, the message is primarily for the
people <br>
listed in the To: component, and the people in the Cc:
component are getting the message &quot;for
information.&quot; In this case, you can leave the Cc:
component empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move the insert cursor to the
Subject: line and enter a Subject. The people that receive
your message will get an idea of what the message is about
from the subject, so take a <br>
moment to think of a good one. For this test, you can type
something like &quot;exmh test message&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Make sure the headers are OK.
In particular, make sure there are no blank lines in the
headers. The mail system treats a blank line as meaning
&quot;end-of-headers&quot;, so you <br>
don&rsquo;t want to prematurely end the header section. If
you have a blank line, position the insert cursor on it and
use Backspace to remove the empty line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Position the cursor at the start
of the message body. You can use the mouse for this, or you
can press &lt;Tab&gt; twice quickly and the editor will
position the cursor correctly. <br>
When using the default MH message templates, this will be
right after the line of all dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Type in your message. When
you type in a long message, the lines will wrap
automatically at word boundaries. To get a blank line for
paragraph boundaries, press &lt;Return&gt;. <br>
The built-in editor supports several editing commands that
are based on the GNU emacs key bindings. If you select the
Simple Edit menu entry under the main Bindings menu, you
<br>
will bring up a dialog that lets you view and edit the key
bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. If you are happy with the
message, you send it by pressing the Send button at the
top-right corner of the window. The Send button will turn
grey, and the window will disap&acirc; <br>
pear once the message has been sent successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want to send the
message, press the Abort button instead. If you want to save
the message draft and continue to work on it later, press
the Save&amp;Quit button. <br>
Working on a saved draft message is described in the
exmh-use man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send yourself a few messages, or
have a friend send you a few test messages. You will use
these test messages to practice moving around in a folder
and deleting messages. Make <br>
one of the messages pretty long so you can practice
scrolling through it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, try sending
mh-mime-sample@online.ora.com a message. This addresses a
program that will return a MIME message to you. Just put
this address in the To field with any&acirc; <br>
thing as the message body and subject. Reading this message
will be described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUSING AROUND <br>
The selection is dragged out with the left mouse button. You
can modify the selection by holding the Shift key while
pressing the left button. A double-click begins a
word-ori&acirc; <br>
ented selection, and a triple-click begins a line-oriented
selection. If you drag a selection off the bottom or top of
a window the text will be scrolled automatically and the
<br>
selection will be extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste is done with the middle
mouse button. The current insert point is used, not the
point at which you middle-click. If you drag the middle
mouse button, then the window is <br>
scrolled instead as described below. There is also a
key-binding for paste, which is &lt;Control-y&gt;. Use
&lt;Control-w&gt; or the &lt;Delete&gt; key to delete the
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The middle mouse button is used
for &quot;drag-scrolling&quot;. To scroll, simply press the
middle mouse button over the text and drag the text. If you
press the Shift key, the scrolling <br>
is faster. Drag-scrolling works in the text widgets, for
vertical scrolling, and the one-line entry widgets, for
horizontal scrolling. The text widgets are used to display
the <br>
folder contents and the current message. The entry widgets
are used in various dialogs in order to enter values. You
can change the scrolling button to the right button or to
<br>
only work with shift-middle. Set this up in the Simple Edit
Bindings... dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buttons and menus are also
sensitive to which mouse button is pressed. Only the left
button activates a button, and it is the
&lt;ButtonRelease&gt; event that is important. If you <br>
accidentally move the mouse off of the button as you release
it, nothing will happen. Don&rsquo;t worry, the wrong button
will not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press the left button over a
menu button to pull down a menu. Most of the menus in exmh
are distinguished with a &quot;...&quot; in their label,
e.g. &quot;More...&quot;. The menu will go away <br>
when the button is released. Release the mouse button off
the menu if you do not want to invoke any menu item. (In
some versions of Tk, the middle button will &quot;tear
off&quot; a Tk <br>
menu. This is quite handy if you use the menu often. To get
the menu to go away, you must click the left button over the
menu button. This will reattach the menu to the menu <br>
button, and another left click will make the menu go away.
In the latest versions of Tk, the first menu entry is a
dashed line that invokes this tear-off operation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING NEW MAIL <br>
By now you should have some new mail waiting. Press the Inc
button from the middle set of buttons that do Folder
operations. This will transfer messages from your system
spool <br>
file into your inbox folder. You will hear an audible cue if
there was new mail, and the table of contents will be
updated to reflect the new messages in your inbox. New
mes&acirc; <br>
sages will be underlined (on a monochrome screen), or blue
(on a color screen), to indicate that you have not read them
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view the new message, click
on its line in the table of contents, or press the Next
button in the bottom group of buttons. The message will be
displayed in the bottom subwin&acirc; <br>
dow, and the line in the table of contents will be
highlighted to remind you which message is being
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view the next message, click
the Next button. The keyboard shortcut for this is the
&rsquo;n&rsquo; key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The view the previous message,
click the Prev button. The keyboard shortcut for this is the
&rsquo;p&rsquo; key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrolling through messages. If
you get a message that is too long to fit into the message
window, then the scrollbar will change its appearance to
indicate how much text is dis&acirc; <br>
played. The scrollbar is Motif-like. You can click on the
arrows at either end to go up and down one line. If you
click above or below the elevator box you go up and down one
<br>
page. You can drag the elevator box to scroll, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also scroll text windows
in exmh by dragging with the middle mouse button. Press the
middle button over the text area, not the scrollbar, and
hold it down while you move <br>
the mouse up or down. If you hold the shift key at the same
time, the scrolling is faster. This works in the folder
Table of Contents window, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint. The space bar is a
keyboard short-cut that does a combination of scrolling and
advancing to the next message. If the message is long, then
space will scroll by one <br>
screen. Once you are at the end of the message, space will
advance to the next message, just like the &rsquo;n&rsquo;
key. You can use the BackSpace key to scroll back through a
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READING MIME MESSAGES <br>
By now you should have also received the sample MIME message
from mh-mime-sample@online.ora.com. The MIME message has
three parts to it, and these are numbered and labeled in
<br>
the display. The first part is a multipart/alternative
content, which means there are a few different ways to view
the content. This is indicated by the message under the
head&acirc; <br>
ing 1. that there are alternative views of the following
content. Exmh will go ahead and display what it thinks is
the best alternative, and you see the text/enriched content
<br>
displayed in part 1.2. If you want to see the other
alternatives, then you can press the right button over
section 1 to get a popup menu with some choices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next two parts are an audio
clip and a picture in GIF format. The audio clip is handled
directly by exmh, and it displays two active text buttons
labeled &quot;Play attached <br>
audio&quot; and &quot;Save audio file&quot;. Click on either
of these with the left mouse button. The part corresponding
to the image displays a message about what the type is, and
suggests <br>
that you press the right mouse button to display a menu. You
can always press the right button to get a MIME menu that
has type-specific options for parts of your message. If <br>
you press the right button over part 2., then the popup menu
will offer you these choices: Decode part as MIME Save Hello
from the author... View using mailcap rule... Pass an <br>
audio fragment to metamail... The first item is a checkbox
menu item that lets you view the raw content if you want to.
The Save... menu entry displays a file selection box so <br>
you can choose a non-temporary file to store the content.
This same function is available through the text button, but
not all MIME parts displays buttons like this. The next <br>
two entries should result in the same thing. They use the
mailcap specifications to run another program that displays
the content. In the first case, View using mailcap <br>
rule..., exmh runs the program directly. In the other case,
Pass to metamail..., the metamail program is run first, and
it decodes the mailcap file and runs the external pro&acirc;
<br>
gram. Again, the text button labeled &quot;Play attached
audio&quot; also plays the audio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPLYING TO MAIL <br>
Select one of the messages from your friend that you&rsquo;d
like to answer. Press the left button over the Reply... menu
button. A menu with a few entries will be displayed. Select
<br>
the Reply to sender menu entry by dragging the mouse down to
that entry and letting up over it. The menu entry has a
&lt;Key-r&gt; in it, which means that you could also press
the &rsquo;r&rsquo; <br>
key to invoke this function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This time the built-in editor
will open a window with a message that is partly filled in.
All the headers are initialized based on the header
components from the original mes&acirc; <br>
sage. The built-in editor will automatically position the
cursor at the beginning of the message body. You can enter
your reply message like you did with the previous messages.
<br>
You should also double-check the header components. In this
case, add yourself to the Cc: component so you will get a
copy of the reply message. When you are done, press the <br>
Send button in the editor window to send the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of ways to
control the format of your reply messages. The MH repl
command has several formatting options, and because exmh
uses repl to set up the reply mes&acirc; <br>
sage, you can customize your reply format. Exmh lets you
define several variations on reply and add them to the
Reply... menu. This is described in the exmh-custom man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should not take long for you
to get the copy of the reply message. Wait a minute or so
and press the Inc button. The keyboard short-cut for Inc is
the &rsquo;i&rsquo; key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTING MESSAGES <br>
Before we go on to more things you can do with messages, we
need to talk about selecting multiple messages at once.
Several of the message operations in exmh can operate on a
<br>
set of messages. You can manually select multiple messages
by using the mouse, or you can select messages based on
their content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the Mouse. To select
messages with the mouse, press the left button and then drag
out a selection. This will select a contiguous range of
messages. If the messages you <br>
want to select are not so nicely organized, you can make a
disjoint selection by holding down the Shift key while
making your selection. This adds new messages to the
selection. <br>
If you shift-click on a message that is already selected,
then it becomes unselected. If you need to select a lot of
messages, simply drag the mouse off the top or bottom of the
<br>
window. It will be scrolled automatically and the selection
will be extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCHING <br>
The Search... menu has several operations for finding
messages and finding text within a message. There is also a
help entry that explains searching in more detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you select &quot;Find in
message body&quot; or &quot;Find in table of contents&quot;
a small search dialog appears. Enter the search string and
use the Next or Prev buttons to find the next <br>
match. When you are searching over the table of contents,
you can select All to select all matching messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other way to search a folder
is with &quot;Pick by attributes&quot;. The MH pick program
is used to search the current folder for messages that match
mail headers like From or Sub&acirc; <br>
ject. You can build up boolean expressions among search
criteria. This is a much more general search mechanism than
the &quot;Find in table of contents&quot; operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get started in the Pick dialog
by pressing the &quot;Choose pick attribute&quot; button. A
menu of attribute types appears, including the Subject,
From, To, and Cc header components. You <br>
can type a regular expression pattern in these entries to
search for messages that have a matching header
component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Before and After attributes
are dates. You can find all messages before or after a given
date by using these fields. You can specify dates as
mm/dd/yy. Be sure to include <br>
the year. Dates can also be keywords like &quot;today&quot;,
&quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot;, and any day of
the week (&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, and so
on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Search attribute is used to
search for something in the body of a message. This will run
little slower because pick must read through all of your
messages, not just their <br>
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you select more than one
attribute, pick finds messages that match all the criteria.
In other words, it does the logical and of the search
criteria. If you want to search <br>
for this or that, then you need to press the Or button in
the dialog. This adds another set of fields to the dialog,
and pick will search for everything that matches the first
<br>
set or matches the second set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Add to Sel&quot;
checkbutton should be set before you do the search. This
controls whether or not the selected messages are added to
any existing selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, use the
&quot;Pick&quot; button to do the search. Once the search
has completed you can perform a few operations on the
selection. You can delete and refile messages as <br>
described later. You can also display a new table of
contents that only contains the selected messages. Use the
&quot;New FTOC&quot; button for this. You can also clear the
unseen state <br>
of the messages with the &quot;Mark Seen&quot; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Clear&quot; button
resets the fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two entries in the dialog
are used to control MH sequences. The only sequence exmh
really supports well is the &quot;unseen&quot; sequence,
although you can define up to 10 sequences <br>
in each folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use New FTOC to get a new
scan listing, it would be better if it appeared in a new
window, but currently it replaces the table of contents. You
can move around and manip&acirc; <br>
ulate messages in this table of contents. However, if you do
another pick, it will only find things in this limited table
of contents, not the whole folder. (Yes, this is a <br>
bug.) Use the Rescan Folder menu entry in the folder More...
menu to get a complete folder listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORWARDING MESSAGES <br>
If you want to send someone a copy of a message or messages
that you have received, use the Forward message operation.
Select the messages as described in the previous section,
<br>
then press the Forward button. The keyboard short-cut for
forward is the &rsquo;f&rsquo; key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message template will have a
copy of the selected messages. You fill in the headers, and
you can also add a short message before the start of the
forwarded messages. When <br>
you are done, press Send to forward the messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING MESSAGES <br>
After you have read a message, you might want to remove it
to keep your mail folders tidy. Exmh uses two steps to
remove mail. In the first step you mark a message as being
<br>
deleted. In the second step you commit the operations on all
marked messages. It turns out that delete just renames your
message files. They will survive until you get another <br>
message by the same number and remove it, too. In addition,
exmh has a &quot;Purge Folder&quot; operation that removes
these renamed files if they are more than a week old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Delete operation applies to
the current message, or you can also select a range of
messages by dragging out a selection in the table of
contents. You can delete the current <br>
message(s) by pressing the Delete button. The keyboard
short-cut is the &rsquo;d&rsquo; key. The deleted message(s)
will be highlighted after the delete operation so you can
easily see the <br>
state of the message. On a monochrome screen, a cross
hatching will be drawn through the table of contents line
for the message. On a color screen, the table of contents
line <br>
will get a dark grey background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you mark a message for
delete, you are automatically advanced to the next message.
This makes it easy to go through your folder and clean it
up. Click &rsquo;d&rsquo; to delete, or <br>
click &rsquo;n&rsquo; to leave it alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint. If you are really in a
hurry, use &rsquo;D&rsquo; and &rsquo;N&rsquo; as your
keyboard short-cuts. This prevents the next message from
being displayed, which can be slow for complex multi-media
<br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are ready to commit the
pending delete actions, press the Commit button. The
keyboard shortcut for commit is &lt;Control-Return&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you decide you do not want to
delete a message you can unmark it. Use the Unmark (Undo)
menu entry that is under the message More... menu. The
unmark operation applies to <br>
the current message or messages, so you have to select the
messages to unmark first. The keyboard short-cut for unmark
is &rsquo;u&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint. The minus,
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, keyboard shortcut takes you to the previous
message, even if it has been marked for delete. Ordinarily
the Prev operation, and the &rsquo;p&rsquo; short-cut for
it, <br>
will skip over marked messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEAVING EXMH <br>
Press the Quit button to leave exmh. It will take a few
moments to close down because it saves some state
information before quitting. The Quit button will grey out
after you <br>
click it, and you will see a few status messages as it shuts
itself down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREFERENCES <br>
Try out the Preferences by turning off the folder cache.
This just takes up display space if you don&rsquo;t have
many folders. If you have lots of nested folders, though,
you might <br>
even want to make this display bigger!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Click the Preference button,
which brings up a dialog that has buttons for several of the
modules that make up exmh. Click on the Folder Cache button
to bring up the preference <br>
items that control the folder cache. In this case there are
just two items: the number of lines of labels in the cache,
and the names of folders that are always in the cache. <br>
Click in the first field and backspace over the default
value of 1. Type in 0 instead, and press &lt;Return&gt;.
Voila! The folder cache disappears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like this setting, press
Save on the main Preference dialog and your changes will be
saved to a file named ~/.exmh-defaults. Press Reset if you
want to undo your changes. <br>
You should be a little careful here, because you are allowed
to Dismiss the preference dialog without saving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another useful preference item
to set is under Background Processing. You can arrange for
exmh to periodically run inc so your messages are
automatically transferred into your <br>
inbox. The advantage of doing this is that the folder label
highlighting works best this way. Unfortunately, exmh does
not give you any visual clues when mail is only waiting <br>
in your system spool file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More details about the
Preferences dialog are given in the exmh-use man page, and
an overview of the various preference sections is given in
the exmh-custom man page..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHAT IS MH MAIL? <br>
MH is a collection of UNIX programs that store, manipulate,
and display your mail. MH originated from RAND, and it is
now in the public domain. Exmh uses these programs to do
<br>
all the hard work, while it concentrates on the user
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the MH programs to
read your mail. Run them from the UNIX command line like you
would cd, ls, cc, or make. They are useful when you are
connecting over a slow line <br>
or cannot run exmh for some other reason. For more details,
there are individual man pages for each MH program, plus one
overview man page called MH. Below is a short summary <br>
of the main MH programs used by exmh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folder Query or set the current
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inc Incorporate mail from your
system spool file into your folders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan Display a listing of a mail

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next Display the next mail
message. (Exmh doesn&rsquo;t actually run this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prev Display the previous mail
message. (Exmh doesn&rsquo;t actually run this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmm Delete a mail message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refile Move a message into
another mail folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repl Reply to a mail message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forw Forward one or more mail

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comp Compose a new mail

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MH keeps track of the current
folder and the current message in between uses of these MH

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each user has a .mh_profile file
that stores general MH settings as well as per-command
settings. Each line has a key, and a value. For example,
your mail directory is set with <br>
the Path profile entry: Path: Mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your old mail system uses
that directory already, just edit your .mh_profile to change
the name used for your MH mail folders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE ABOUT EXMH <br>
This man page should get you started with exmh. If you
decide you want to know more about it, here are some of the
features described in the other exmh man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME support. Exmh can display
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) messages,
either directly or with the help of the metamail package.
The built-in editor lets you <br>
compose enriched text messages and insert files as parts of
a multipart message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail Folders. You can create
other mail folders to hold messages about certain topics or
from certain people. You can create a hierarchical
arrangement of folders, just like <br>
the hierarchical directory structure of the file system. The
folder display supports these nested folders, and it allows
you to nest folders to any depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail Filtering. Mail filtering
lets you sort mail into different folders before you read
it. If you get lots of mail, this is a great way to avoid
plowing through junk mail <br>
just to get your important messages. The folder labels are
highlighted to indicate which folders have unread mail in
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Facesaver bitmap display. If you
have a facesaver database on your system, exmh displays the
bitmap face of the person that sent the current message (or
their organization).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Background processing. You can
set exmh to run inc periodically, check for new messages
arriving asynchronously in folders, run the MH msgchk
program, or count up the messages <br>
in your mail spool file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editor interface. You can hook
exmh to your favorite editor using the exmh-async script.
Or, Tcl-based editors such as mxedit can interact with exmh
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keybinding User Interface. You
can define new key bindings for Tcl commands that are part
of the implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aliases User Interface. A
browser for your MH aliases lets you define new aliases and
insert aliases into mail messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). If
you have PGP, you can use it from exmh to digitally sign,
encrypt, and decrypt messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Programming. If the
preference settings are not enough for you, you can program
exmh more directly. You can define new buttons and menus and
add new Tcl code to its imple&acirc; <br>
mentation.</p>
