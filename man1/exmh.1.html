exmh - An introduction to the exmh mail user interface.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
This man page provides a quick tour through some of the basic features of
  <i>exmh version 2.0,</i> which provides a graphical user interface to the MH
  mail system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After you read this tutorial you should be able to use <i>exmh</i> for your
  basic daily mail reading needs. You will learn how to send mail, read mail,
  manage your messages in folders, and adjust some of the <i>exmh</i> features
  by means of its Preferences user interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is much more documentation available on-line through HTML pages that are
  viewable from within exmh. In particular. <b>exmh-use</b> provides information
  about using the more advanced features of <i>exmh</i>. If you are already an
  experienced email user, you may want to just read the GETTING STARTED section
  here and then skip to the <b>exmh-use</b> man page. <b>exmh-custom</b>
  describes how to customize exmh to suit your needs. <b>exmh-ref</b> lists each
  button and menu entry in <i>exmh</i> and explains what they do. If you are an
  experienced <i>exmh</i> user, this may be the most useful man page for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A cleaned up version of these man pages appear in the 3rd edition of the book by
  Jerry Peek, <i>MH &amp; xmh:</i> <i>email for users and programmers</i>, which
  is published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Web versions of the documentation can also be found at
<div class="Pp"></div>
http://www.beedub.com/exmh/
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
If you are already an MH or <i>xmh</i> user, you can start with the examples
  given in this tour. If you are a new user, exmh will set up your basic MH
  environment. This includes a Mail directory which will have one subdirectory
  for each mail folder, plus several files that MH mail uses for its own
  purposes. You also get a ~/.mh_profile file that has user settings for MH and
  exmh.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Exmh</i> uses the regular MH programs to manipulate your mail folders and
  messages. This means it is compatible with command-line use of MH programs,
  and its actions should be familiar if you are an experienced MH user. If you
  are a new MH user, then the details of running MH programs is hidden behind
  the graphical interface. The MH programs used by exmh are described towards
  the end of this man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you run <i>exmh</i> for the first time it checks a few things in your MH
  profile. In particular, it depends on the Draft-Folder and Unseen-Sequence
  profile components. If these profile components are not present, a dialog
  appears and <i>exmh</i> can set them up for you. If you do not let <i>exmh</i>
  create them nor set them up by hand, <i>exmh</i> will not work properly. These
  profile entries are described in the <b>exmh-ref</b> man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Exmh</i> has been designed to be very flexible, although it will work just
  fine &quot;out of the box&quot;. The Preference package used to adjust some of
  the settings in exmh is introduced in this man page, and some of the important
  settings are described here. A more complete guide to customizing <i>exmh</i>
  is given in the <b>exmh-custom</b> man page.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNNING_EXMH"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNNING_EXMH">RUNNING
  EXMH</a></h1>
The command to start <i>exmh</i> looks like this:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
exmh -display  <i>hostname</i>:0 &amp;
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If your DISPLAY environment variable is set up properly, then the -display
  argument is not needed, and the command is even simpler. You do not need to
  specify a -geometry argument, although <i>exmh</i> supports one. Instead,
  simply position and size the window using your window manager. When
  <i>exmh</i> quits, it saves the geometry information so you don't have to
  worry about it. It does this with all its top level windows, so you can adjust
  their position once and then forget about it. There are more command line
  options described in the <b>exmh-ref</b> man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can add the exmh command to your startup X environment by editing your
  startup file (like .xsession). You might also want to add it to the main menu
  of your window manager. The details about this vary from X system to X system,
  so ask your local X guru for help. <i>Exmh</i> also supports the window
  manager session protocol, which means that session-smart window managers will
  automatically start exmh for you if you quit X when <i>exmh</i> is running.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_EXMH_DISPLAY"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_EXMH_DISPLAY">THE
  EXMH DISPLAY</a></h1>
This section describes the main parts of the <i>exmh</i> display. It probably
  makes sense to run exmh at this point so you can follow along. There are three
  sets of buttons in the interface, and three main subwindows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Main Buttons</b>. Along the top of the window is a set of buttons and menus
  that apply to <i>exmh</i> itself. Quit, for example, quits <i>exmh</i>. The
  Help button pops up a menu, and you can select the entries there to get more
  on-line information about <i>exmh</i>. Use the left mouse button to select the
  buttons and menus. A button will change its appearance when you press it, and
  it will be invoked when you release the mouse over the button. If you slide
  the mouse off the button before releasing it, nothing happens.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Folder Display</b>. Below the main buttons is the folder display subwindow.
  It has a special button for each of your top-level folders, and these are
  called <i>folder labels</i>. As a new user you will see two folder labels, one
  for inbox and drafts. The inbox folder is for your new messages, and the
  drafts folder is for messages you are writing. If you have used MH (or xmh)
  before, then you may have many more folders that will appear in this display.
  The mouse bindings for folder labels are explained in the <b>exmh-use</b> man
  page. The <i>Color Legend</i> from the Help menu also tells you how the folder
  labels respond to mouse clicks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Folder Cache</b>. A second folder display called the <i>folder cache</i> may
  appear under the main folder display. This shows the folder labels for
  recently used folders. If you only have a few folders this wastes screen real
  estate. The PREFERENCES section near the end of this man page explains how to
  turn this off via the Folder Cache preferences setting. If you are a
  first-time exmh user, Exmh tries to guess if you need this display based on
  the number of folders and nested folders you have.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Folder Buttons</b>. The middle set of buttons is for operations that apply to
  folders. For example, you can create a new folder with the New button here.
  The More... button displays a popup menu with several more operations you can
  apply to folders. Some of these buttons will be introduced in this man page.
  All of these buttons and menus are explained in detail in the <b>exmh-ref</b>
  man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To the left of the folder buttons, summary information about the current folder
  is displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Table of Contents</b>. The middle subwindow of the display shows a summary of
  the messages in the folder. It shows the message number, the date of the
  message, the subject of the message, and, space permitting, the first few
  words of the message. Left click on a line in the table of contents to view
  the corresponding message. The mouse bindings for the table of contents are
  described in more detail in the <b>exmh-use</b> man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
MH experts: The display in this window comes from both the MH scan program or MH
  inc programs, so it is affected by the form specification used by these
  programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Color and Monochrome Highlights</b>. Both the folder display and table of
  contents windows use highlights to give you visual clues about the state of
  messages and folders. Your unread messages are highlighted in the table of
  contents and the folders that contain unread message are highlighted in the
  folder display. Pull down the main Help menu and select <i>Color Legend</i> to
  display a key to the highlights for your display. The highlighting is covered
  in more detail later in the <b>exmh-use</b> man page. The <b>exmh-custom</b>
  man page tells how you can control the highlighting yourself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Status Line</b>. Just below the table of contents is the status line. This
  has two parts. The left part shows the name of the folder and the message
  number for the current message, if any. The right part gives feedback about
  what <i>exmh</i> is doing. After it displays a message, the Subject component
  is displayed there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Subwindow Resize Diamond.</b> The black diamond to the right of the status
  line is used to change the size of the internal windows. Press the first mouse
  button on this target and a horizontal line appears. Drag it up and down to
  adjust the window sizes. Try dragging it all the way to the top and bottom of
  the exmh window to see how the mode changes to adjust different windows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Message Buttons</b> The bottom row of buttons are for operations that apply
  to the current message. Several of these operations will be introduced in this
  man page. The right hand button labeled More... brings up a menu with several
  more advanced message operations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hint:</i> Many of these message operations have keyboard shortcuts that make
  it easy to use <i>exmh</i> with your hands on the keyboard. Some of the
  short-cuts are introduced in this man page, and all of them are listed in the
  <b>exmh-use</b> man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Message Display</b>. The bottom subwindow displays the current message, if
  any. Some of the less interesting mail headers start out scrolled off the top
  of this window.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SENDING_MAIL"><a class="selflink" href="#SENDING_MAIL">SENDING
  MAIL</a></h1>
A good way to test things out is to send a message to yourself. Here are the
  steps you take to do that:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1. Click the Send button, which is in the Message buttons in the bottom group. A
  new window will open that contains the template for your message. The built-in
  editor, which is called <i>sedit</i>, will start out with the insert cursor
  positioned at the end of the first empty header line. Enter your user name
  after the To: header. If you want to send the message to more than one person,
  use a comma to separate the names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. Position the insert cursor on the next header line. You can do this a few
  different ways. The most direct way is to click the left mouse button where
  you want the cursor to be. There are keyboard shortcuts, too. If you press
  &lt;Tab&gt; the editor will take you to the end of the next header line. You
  can also use the arrow keys or some emacs-like bindings to move the cursor.
  &lt;Control-n&gt; goes to the next line, &lt;Control-f&gt; moves the cursor
  forward a character. &lt;Control-p&gt; moves up a line, and &lt;Control-b&gt;
  moves back a character. The <i>Simple Edit</i> menu entry shows you all the
  keybindings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. The next header is the Cc: line. People listed in the Cc: line get a
  &quot;courtesy&quot; (or &quot;carbon&quot;) copy of the message. By
  convention, the message is primarily for the people listed in the To:
  component, and the people in the Cc: component are getting the message
  &quot;for information.&quot; In this case, you can leave the Cc: component
  empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Move the insert cursor to the Subject: line and enter a Subject. The people that
  receive your message will get an idea of what the message is about from the
  subject, so take a moment to think of a good one. For this test, you can type
  something like &quot;exmh test message&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4. Make sure the headers are OK. In particular, make sure there are no blank
  lines in the headers. The mail system treats a blank line as meaning
  &quot;end-of-headers&quot;, so you don't want to prematurely end the header
  section. If you have a blank line, position the insert cursor on it and use
  Backspace to remove the empty line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Position the cursor at the start of the message body. You can use the mouse for
  this, or you can press &lt;Tab&gt; twice quickly and the editor will position
  the cursor correctly. When using the default MH message templates, this will
  be right after the line of all dashes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
5. Type in your message. When you type in a long message, the lines will wrap
  automatically at word boundaries. To get a blank line for paragraph
  boundaries, press &lt;Return&gt;. The built-in editor supports several editing
  commands that are based on the GNU emacs key bindings. If you select the
  <i>Simple Edit</i> menu entry under the main Bindings menu, you will bring up
  a dialog that lets you view and edit the key bindings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
6. If you are happy with the message, you send it by pressing the Send button at
  the top-right corner of the window. The Send button will turn grey, and the
  window will disappear once the message has been sent successfully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do not want to send the message, press the Abort button instead. If you
  want to save the message draft and continue to work on it later, press the
  Save&amp;Quit button. Working on a saved draft message is described in the
  <b>exmh-use</b> man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Send yourself a few messages, or have a friend send you a few test messages. You
  will use these test messages to practice moving around in a folder and
  deleting messages. Make one of the messages pretty long so you can practice
  scrolling through it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, try sending mh-mime-sample@online.ora.com a message. This addresses a
  program that will return a MIME message to you. Just put this address in the
  To field with anything as the message body and subject. Reading this message
  will be described below.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MOUSING_AROUND"><a class="selflink" href="#MOUSING_AROUND">MOUSING
  AROUND</a></h1>
The selection is dragged out with the left mouse button. You can modify the
  selection by holding the Shift key while pressing the left button. A
  double-click begins a word-oriented selection, and a triple-click begins a
  line-oriented selection. If you drag a selection off the bottom or top of a
  window the text will be scrolled automatically and the selection will be
  extended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Paste is done with the middle mouse button. <i>The current insert point is used,
  not the point at which you middle-click.</i> If you drag the middle mouse
  button, then the window is scrolled instead as described below. There is also
  a key-binding for paste, which is &lt;Control-y&gt;. Use &lt;Control-w&gt; or
  the &lt;Delete&gt; key to delete the selection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The middle mouse button is used for &quot;drag-scrolling&quot;. To scroll,
  simply press the middle mouse button over the text and drag the text. If you
  press the Shift key, the scrolling is faster. Drag-scrolling works in the text
  widgets, for vertical scrolling, and the one-line entry widgets, for
  horizontal scrolling. The text widgets are used to display the folder contents
  and the current message. The entry widgets are used in various dialogs in
  order to enter values. You can change the scrolling button to the right button
  or to only work with shift-middle. Set this up in the Simple Edit Bindings...
  dialog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Buttons and menus are also sensitive to which mouse button is pressed. Only the
  left button activates a button, and it is the &lt;ButtonRelease&gt; event that
  is important. If you accidentally move the mouse off of the button as you
  release it, nothing will happen. Don't worry, the wrong button will not be
  invoked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Press the left button over a menu button to pull down a menu. Most of the menus
  in <i>exmh</i> are distinguished with a &quot;...&quot; in their label, e.g.
  &quot;More...&quot;. The menu will go away when the button is released.
  Release the mouse button off the menu if you do not want to invoke any menu
  item. (In some versions of Tk, the middle button will &quot;tear off&quot; a
  Tk menu. This is quite handy if you use the menu often. To get the menu to go
  away, you must click the left button over the menu button. This will reattach
  the menu to the menu button, and another left click will make the menu go
  away. In the latest versions of Tk, the first menu entry is a dashed line that
  invokes this tear-off operation.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_NEW_MAIL"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_NEW_MAIL">GETTING
  NEW MAIL</a></h1>
By now you should have some new mail waiting. Press the Inc button from the
  middle set of buttons that do Folder operations. This will transfer messages
  from your system spool file into your inbox folder. You will hear an audible
  cue if there was new mail, and the table of contents will be updated to
  reflect the new messages in your inbox. New messages will be underlined (on a
  monochrome screen), or blue (on a color screen), to indicate that you have not
  read them yet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To view the new message, click on its line in the table of contents, or press
  the Next button in the bottom group of buttons. The message will be displayed
  in the bottom subwindow, and the line in the table of contents will be
  highlighted to remind you which message is being displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To view the next message, click the Next button. The keyboard shortcut for this
  is the 'n' key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The view the previous message, click the Prev button. The keyboard shortcut for
  this is the 'p' key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Scrolling through messages</b>. If you get a message that is too long to fit
  into the message window, then the scrollbar will change its appearance to
  indicate how much text is displayed. The scrollbar is Motif-like. You can
  click on the arrows at either end to go up and down one line. If you click
  above or below the elevator box you go up and down one page. You can drag the
  elevator box to scroll, too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also scroll text windows in <i>exmh</i> by dragging with the middle
  mouse button. Press the middle button over the text area, not the scrollbar,
  and hold it down while you move the mouse up or down. If you hold the shift
  key at the same time, the scrolling is faster. This works in the folder Table
  of Contents window, too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hint</i>. The space bar is a keyboard short-cut that does a combination of
  scrolling and advancing to the next message. If the message is long, then
  space will scroll by one screen. Once you are at the end of the message, space
  will advance to the next message, just like the 'n' key. You can use the
  BackSpace key to scroll back through a message.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="READING_MIME_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#READING_MIME_MESSAGES">READING
  MIME MESSAGES</a></h1>
By now you should have also received the sample MIME message from
  mh-mime-sample@online.ora.com. The MIME message has three parts to it, and
  these are numbered and labeled in the display. The first part is a
  multipart/alternative content, which means there are a few different ways to
  view the content. This is indicated by the message under the heading <b>1.</b>
  that there are alternative views of the following content. <i>Exmh</i> will go
  ahead and display what it thinks is the best alternative, and you see the
  text/enriched content displayed in part <b>1.2</b>. If you want to see the
  other alternatives, then you can press the right button over section 1 to get
  a popup menu with some choices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next two parts are an audio clip and a picture in GIF format. The audio clip
  is handled directly by exmh, and it displays two active text buttons labeled
  &quot;Play attached audio&quot; and &quot;Save audio file&quot;. Click on
  either of these with the left mouse button. The part corresponding to the
  image displays a message about what the type is, and suggests that you press
  the right mouse button to display a menu. You can always press the right
  button to get a MIME menu that has type-specific options for parts of your
  message. If you press the right button over part <b>2.</b>, then the popup
  menu will offer you these choices:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Decode part as MIME
Save Hello from the author...
View using mailcap rule...
Pass an audio fragment to metamail...
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first item is a checkbox menu item that lets you view the raw content if you
  want to. The Save... menu entry displays a file selection box so you can
  choose a non-temporary file to store the content. This same function is
  available through the text button, but not all MIME parts displays buttons
  like this. The next two entries should result in the same thing. They use the
  mailcap specifications to run another program that displays the content. In
  the first case, View using mailcap rule..., <i>exmh</i> runs the program
  directly. In the other case, Pass to metamail..., the <i>metamail</i> program
  is run first, and it decodes the mailcap file and runs the external program.
  Again, the text button labeled &quot;Play attached audio&quot; also plays the
  audio.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPLYING_TO_MAIL"><a class="selflink" href="#REPLYING_TO_MAIL">REPLYING
  TO MAIL</a></h1>
Select one of the messages from your friend that you'd like to answer. Press the
  left button over the Reply... menu button. A menu with a few entries will be
  displayed. Select the <i>Reply to sender</i> menu entry by dragging the mouse
  down to that entry and letting up over it. The menu entry has a &lt;Key-r&gt;
  in it, which means that you could also press the 'r' key to invoke this
  function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This time the built-in editor will open a window with a message that is partly
  filled in. All the headers are initialized based on the header components from
  the original message. The built-in editor will automatically position the
  cursor at the beginning of the message body. You can enter your reply message
  like you did with the previous messages. You should also double-check the
  header components. In this case, add yourself to the Cc: component so you will
  get a copy of the reply message. When you are done, press the Send button in
  the editor window to send the message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a number of ways to control the format of your reply messages. The MH
  <i>repl</i> command has several formatting options, and because <i>exmh</i>
  uses <i>repl</i> to set up the reply message, you can customize your reply
  format. <i>Exmh</i> lets you define several variations on reply and add them
  to the Reply... menu. This is described in the <b>exmh-custom</b> man page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It should not take long for you to get the copy of the reply message. Wait a
  minute or so and press the Inc button. The keyboard short-cut for Inc is the
  'i' key.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SELECTING_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#SELECTING_MESSAGES">SELECTING
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
Before we go on to more things you can do with messages, we need to talk about
  selecting multiple messages at once. Several of the message operations in
  <i>exmh</i> can operate on a set of messages. You can manually select multiple
  messages by using the mouse, or you can select messages based on their
  content.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Using the Mouse</b>. To select messages with the mouse, press the left button
  and then drag out a selection. This will select a contiguous range of
  messages. If the messages you want to select are not so nicely organized, you
  can make a disjoint selection by holding down the Shift key while making your
  selection. This adds new messages to the selection. If you shift-click on a
  message that is already selected, then it becomes unselected. If you need to
  select a lot of messages, simply drag the mouse off the top or bottom of the
  window. It will be scrolled automatically and the selection will be extended.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEARCHING"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCHING">SEARCHING</a></h1>
The Search... menu has several operations for finding messages and finding text
  within a message. There is also a help entry that explains searching in more
  detail.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you select &quot;Find in message body&quot; or &quot;Find in table of
  contents&quot; a small search dialog appears. Enter the search string and use
  the Next or Prev buttons to find the next match. When you are searching over
  the table of contents, you can select All to select all matching messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The other way to search a folder is with &quot;Pick by attributes&quot;. The MH
  pick program is used to search the current folder for messages that match mail
  headers like From or Subject. You can build up boolean expressions among
  search criteria. This is a much more general search mechanism than the
  &quot;Find in table of contents&quot; operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Get started in the Pick dialog by pressing the &quot;Choose pick attribute&quot;
  button. A menu of attribute types appears, including the Subject, From, To,
  and Cc header components. You can type a regular expression pattern in these
  entries to search for messages that have a matching header component.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Before and After attributes are dates. You can find all messages before or
  after a given date by using these fields. You can specify dates as mm/dd/yy.
  Be sure to include the year. Dates can also be keywords like
  &quot;today&quot;, &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot;, and any day of
  the week (&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, and so on.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Search attribute is used to search for something in the body of a message.
  This will run little slower because <i>pick</i> must read through all of your
  messages, not just their headers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you select more than one attribute, <i>pick</i> finds messages that match all
  the criteria. In other words, it does the logical <i>and</i> of the search
  criteria. If you want to search for this <i>or</i> that, then you need to
  press the Or button in the dialog. This adds another set of fields to the
  dialog, and pick will search for everything that matches the first set
  <i>or</i> matches the second set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Add to Sel&quot; checkbutton should be set <i>before</i> you do the
  search. This controls whether or not the selected messages are added to any
  existing selection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, use the &quot;Pick&quot; button to do the search. Once the search has
  completed you can perform a few operations on the selection. You can delete
  and refile messages as described later. You can also display a new table of
  contents that only contains the selected messages. Use the &quot;New
  FTOC&quot; button for this. You can also clear the unseen state of the
  messages with the &quot;Mark Seen&quot; button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Clear&quot; button resets the fields.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two entries in the dialog are used to control MH sequences. The only
  sequence exmh really supports well is the &quot;unseen&quot; sequence,
  although you can define up to 10 sequences in each folder.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use New FTOC to get a new scan listing, it would be better if it appeared
  in a new window, but currently it replaces the table of contents. You can move
  around and manipulate messages in this table of contents. However, if you do
  another pick, it will only find things in this limited table of contents, not
  the whole folder. (Yes, this is a bug.) Use the Rescan Folder menu entry in
  the folder More... menu to get a complete folder listing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FORWARDING_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#FORWARDING_MESSAGES">FORWARDING
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
If you want to send someone a copy of a message or messages that you have
  received, use the Forward message operation. Select the messages as described
  in the previous section, then press the Forward button. The keyboard short-cut
  for forward is the 'f' key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The message template will have a copy of the selected messages. You fill in the
  headers, and you can also add a short message before the start of the
  forwarded messages. When you are done, press Send to forward the messages.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DELETING_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#DELETING_MESSAGES">DELETING
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
After you have read a message, you might want to remove it to keep your mail
  folders tidy. <i>Exmh</i> uses two steps to remove mail. In the first step you
  <i>mark</i> a message as being deleted. In the second step you <i>commit</i>
  the operations on all marked messages. It turns out that delete just renames
  your message files. They will survive until you get another message by the
  same number and remove it, too. In addition, exmh has a &quot;Purge
  Folder&quot; operation that removes these renamed files if they are more than
  a week old.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Delete operation applies to the current message, or you can also select a
  range of messages by dragging out a selection in the table of contents. You
  can delete the current message(s) by pressing the Delete button. The keyboard
  short-cut is the 'd' key. The deleted message(s) will be highlighted after the
  delete operation so you can easily see the state of the message. On a
  monochrome screen, a cross hatching will be drawn through the table of
  contents line for the message. On a color screen, the table of contents line
  will get a dark grey background.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After you mark a message for delete, you are automatically advanced to the next
  message. This makes it easy to go through your folder and clean it up. Click
  'd' to delete, or click 'n' to leave it alone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hint</i>. If you are really in a hurry, use 'D' and 'N' as your keyboard
  short-cuts. This prevents the next message from being displayed, which can be
  slow for complex multi-media messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you are ready to commit the pending delete actions, press the Commit
  button. The keyboard shortcut for commit is &lt;Control-Return&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you decide you do not want to delete a message you can unmark it. Use the
  <i>Unmark (Undo)</i> menu entry that is under the message More... menu. The
  unmark operation applies to the current message or messages, so you have to
  select the messages to unmark first. The keyboard short-cut for unmark is 'u'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hint</i>. The minus, '-', keyboard shortcut takes you to the previous
  message, even if it has been marked for delete. Ordinarily the Prev operation,
  and the 'p' short-cut for it, will skip over marked messages.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LEAVING_EXMH"><a class="selflink" href="#LEAVING_EXMH">LEAVING
  EXMH</a></h1>
Press the Quit button to leave exmh. It will take a few moments to close down
  because it saves some state information before quitting. The Quit button will
  grey out after you click it, and you will see a few status messages as it
  shuts itself down.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREFERENCES"><a class="selflink" href="#PREFERENCES">PREFERENCES</a></h1>
Try out the Preferences by turning off the folder cache. This just takes up
  display space if you don't have many folders. If you have lots of nested
  folders, though, you might even want to make this display bigger!
<div class="Pp"></div>
Click the Preference button, which brings up a dialog that has buttons for
  several of the modules that make up <i>exmh</i>. Click on the Folder Cache
  button to bring up the preference items that control the folder cache. In this
  case there are just two items: the number of lines of labels in the cache, and
  the names of folders that are always in the cache. Click in the first field
  and backspace over the default value of 1. Type in 0 instead, and press
  &lt;Return&gt;. Voila! The folder cache disappears.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you like this setting, press Save on the main Preference dialog and your
  changes will be saved to a file named ~/.exmh-defaults. Press Reset if you
  want to undo your changes. You should be a little careful here, because you
  are allowed to Dismiss the preference dialog without saving.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another useful preference item to set is under Background Processing. You can
  arrange for <i>exmh</i> to periodically run <i>inc</i> so your messages are
  automatically transferred into your inbox. The advantage of doing this is that
  the folder label highlighting works best this way. Unfortunately, <i>exmh</i>
  does not give you any visual clues when mail is only waiting in your system
  spool file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
More details about the Preferences dialog are given in the <b>exmh-use</b> man
  page, and an overview of the various preference sections is given in the
  <b>exmh-custom</b> man page..
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHAT_IS_MH_MAIL?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_IS_MH_MAIL?">WHAT
  IS MH MAIL?</a></h1>
MH is a collection of UNIX programs that store, manipulate, and display your
  mail. MH originated from RAND, and it is now in the public domain. Exmh uses
  these programs to do all the hard work, while it concentrates on the user
  interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the MH programs to read your mail. Run them from the UNIX command
  line like you would cd, ls, cc, or make. They are useful when you are
  connecting over a slow line or cannot run exmh for some other reason. For more
  details, there are individual man pages for each MH program, plus one overview
  man page called MH. Below is a short summary of the main MH programs used by
  exmh.

MH keeps track of the current folder and the current message in between uses of
  these MH programs. For example:

Each user has a .mh_profile file that stores general MH settings as well as
  per-command settings. Each line has a key, and a value. For example, your mail
  directory is set with the Path profile entry:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Path: Mail
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your old mail system uses that directory already, just edit your .mh_profile
  to change the name used for your MH mail folders.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MORE_ABOUT_EXMH"><a class="selflink" href="#MORE_ABOUT_EXMH">MORE
  ABOUT EXMH</a></h1>
This man page should get you started with <i>exmh</i>. If you decide you want to
  know more about it, here are some of the features described in the other
  <i>exmh</i> man pages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MIME support</b>. <i>Exmh</i> can display MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
  Extensions) messages, either directly or with the help of the <i>metamail</i>
  package. The built-in editor lets you compose enriched text messages and
  insert files as parts of a multipart message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Mail Folders</b>. You can create other mail folders to hold messages about
  certain topics or from certain people. You can create a hierarchical
  arrangement of folders, just like the hierarchical directory structure of the
  file system. The folder display supports these <i>nested folders</i>, and it
  allows you to nest folders to any depth.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Mail Filtering</b>. Mail filtering lets you sort mail into different folders
  <i>before</i> you read it. If you get lots of mail, this is a great way to
  avoid plowing through junk mail just to get your important messages. The
  folder labels are highlighted to indicate which folders have unread mail in
  them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Facesaver bitmap display</b>. If you have a facesaver database on your
  system, <i>exmh</i> displays the bitmap face of the person that sent the
  current message (or their organization).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Background processing</b>. You can set <i>exmh</i> to run <i>inc</i>
  periodically, check for new messages arriving asynchronously in folders, run
  the MH <i>msgchk</i> program, or count up the messages in your mail spool
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Editor interface</b>. You can hook <i>exmh</i> to your favorite editor using
  the <b>exmh-async</b> script. Or, Tcl-based editors such as <i>mxedit</i> can
  interact with <i>exmh</i> directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Keybinding User Interface</b>. You can define new key bindings for Tcl
  commands that are part of the implementation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Aliases User Interface</b>. A browser for your MH aliases lets you define new
  aliases and insert aliases into mail messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</b>. If you have PGP, you can use it from
  <i>exmh</i> to digitally sign, encrypt, and decrypt messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>User Programming</b>. If the preference settings are not enough for you, you
  can program <i>exmh</i> more directly. You can define new buttons and menus
  and add new Tcl code to its implementation.
