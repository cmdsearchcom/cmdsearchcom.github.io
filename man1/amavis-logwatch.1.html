AMAVIS-LOGWATCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
amavis-logwatch - An Amavisd-new log parser and analysis
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
amavis-logwatch [options] [logfile ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The amavis-logwatch(1) utility is an Amavisd-new log parser
that produces summaries, details, and statistics regarding
the operation of Amavisd-new (henceforth, simply called <br>
Amavis).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can be used as a
standalone program, or as a Logwatch filter module to
produce Amavisd-new summary and detailed reports from within
Logwatch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amavis-logwatch is able to
produce a wide range of reports with data grouped and sorted
as much as possible to reduce noise and highlight patterns.
Brief summary reports provide <br>
a quick overview of general Amavis operations and message
delivery, calling out warnings that may require attention.
Detailed reports provide easy to scan, hierarchically- <br>
arranged and organized information, with as much or little
detail as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much of the interesting data is
available when Amavis&rsquo; $log_level is set to at least
2. See Amavis Log Level below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amavis-logwatch outputs two
principal sections: a Summary section and a Detailed
section. For readability and quick scanning, all event or
hit counts appear in the left column, <br>
followed by brief description of the event type, and finally
additional statistics or count representations may appear in
the rightmost column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following segment from a
sample Summary report illustrates:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">****** Summary

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report indicates there were
9 general warnings, and Amavis scanned a total of 20313
messages for a total of 1008.53 megabytes or 1,057,524,252
bytes. The next summary groups <br>
shows the Blocked / Passed overview, with 1190 Blocked
messages (broken down as 18 messages blocked as malware, 4
messages with banned names, 416 spam messages, and 752
discarded <br>
messages), and 19123 Passed messages (47 messages with bad
headers and 19076 clean messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next (optional) summary
grouping shows message disposition by contents category.
There were 18 malware messages and 4 banned file messages
(all blocked), 1168 Spam messages, <br>
of which 416 were blocked (quarantined) and 752 discarded.
Finally, there were 19123 messages consdidered to be Ham
(i.e. not spam), 47 of which contained bad headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional count summaries for a
variety of events are also listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are dozens of sub-sections
available in the Detailed report, each of whose output can
be controlled in various ways. Each sub-section attempts to
group and present the <br>
most meaningful data at superior levels, while pushing less
useful or noisy data towards inferior levels. The goal is to
provide as much benefit as possible from smart grouping <br>
of data, to allow faster report scanning, pattern
identification, and problem solving. Data is always sorted
in descending order by count, and then numerically by IP
address or <br>
alphabetically as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following Spam blocked
segment from a sample Detailed report illustrates the basic
hierarchical level structure of amavis-logwatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">****** Detailed

5 192.168.2.1 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amavis-logwatch utility
reads from STDIN or from the named Amavis logfile. Multiple
logfile arguments may be specified, each processed in order.
The user running amavis- <br>
logwatch must have read permission on each named log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The options listed below affect the operation of
amavis-logwatch. Options specified later on the command line
override earlier ones. Any option may be abbreviated to an
unam&acirc; <br>
biguous length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]autolearn <br>
--show_autolearn boolean <br>
Enables (disables) output of the autolearn report. This
report is only available if the default Amavis $log_templ
has been modified to provide autolearn results in log <br>
entries. This can be done by uncommenting two lines in the
Amavis program itself (where the default log templates
reside), or by correctly adding the $log_templ variable <br>
to the amavisd.conf file. See Amavis&rsquo; README.customize
and search near the end of the Amavisd program for
&quot;autolearn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]by_ccat_summary <br>
--show_by_ccat_summary boolean <br>
Enables (disables) the by contents category summary in the
Summary section. Default: enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config_file <br>
--config_file config_file <br>
Use an alternate configuration file config_file instead of
the default. This option may be used more than once.
Multiple configuration files will be processed in the <br>
order presented on the command line. See CONFIGURATION FILE
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug keywords <br>
Output debug information during the operation of
amavis-logwatch. The parameter keywords is one or more comma
or space separated keywords. To obtain the list of valid
<br>
keywords, use --debug xxx where xxx is any invalid
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detail level <br>
Sets the maximum detail level for amavis-logwatch to level.
This option is global, overriding any other output limiters
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amavis-logwatch utility
produces a Summary section, a Detailed section, and
additional report sections. With level less than 5,
amavis-logwatch will produce only the <br>
Summary section. At level 5 and above, the Detailed section,
and any additional report sections are candidates for
output. Each incremental increase in level generates <br>
one additional hierarchical sub-level of output in the
Detailed section of the report. At level 10, all levels are
output. Lines that exceed the maximum report width <br>
(specified with max_report_width) will be cut. Setting level
to 11 will prevent lines in the report from being cut (see
also --line_style).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]first_recip_only <br>
--show_first_recip_only boolean <br>
Specifies whether or not to sort by, and show, only the
first recipient when a scanned messages contains multiple
recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print usage information
and a brief description about command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipaddr_width width <br>
Specifies that IP addresses in address/hostname pairs should
be printed with a field width of width characters.
Increasing the default may be useful for systems using <br>
long IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l limiter=levelspec <br>
--limit limiter=levelspec <br>
Sets the level limiter limiter with the specification
levelspec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line_style style <br>
Specifies how to handle long report lines. Three styles are
available: full, truncate, and wrap. Setting style to full
will prevent cutting lines to max_report_width; <br>
this is what occurs when detail is 11 or higher. When style
is truncate (the default), long lines will be truncated
according to max_report_width. Setting style to wrap <br>
will wrap lines longer than max_report_width such that left
column hit counts are not obscured. This option takes
precedence over the line style implied by the detail <br>
level. The options --full, --truncate, and --wrap are
synonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodetail <br>
Disables the Detailed section of the report, and all
supplemental reports. This option provides a convenient
mechanism to quickly disable all sections under the Detailed
<br>
report, where subsequent command line options may re-enable
one or more sections to create specific reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sarules
&lsquo;S,H&Acirc;&acute; <br>
--sarules default <br>
Enables the SpamAssassin Rules Hit report. The
comma-separated S and H arguments are top N values for the
Spam and Ham reports, respectively, and can be any integer
<br>
greater than or equal to 0, or the keyword all. The keyword
default uses the built-in default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosarules <br>
Disables the SpamAssassin Rules Hit report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sa_timings nrows <br>
Enables the SpamAssassin Timings percentiles report. The
report can be limited to the top N rows with the nrows
argument. This report requires Amavis 2.6+ and
SpamAssas&acirc; <br>
sin 3.3+.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sa_timings_percentiles
&lsquo;P1 [P2 ...]&Acirc;&acute; <br>
Specifies the percentiles shown in the SpamAssassin Timings
report. The arguments P1 ... are integers from 0 to 100
inclusive. Their order will be preserved in the <br>
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosa_timings <br>
Disables the SpamAssassin Timings report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print amavis-logwatch version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--score_frequencies &lsquo;B1
[B2 ...]&Acirc;&acute; <br>
--score_frequencies default <br>
Enables the Spam Score Frequency report. The arguments B1
... are frequency distribution buckets, and can be any real
numbers. Their order will be preserved in the <br>
report. The keyword default uses the built-in default
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noscore_frequencies <br>
Disables the Spam Score Frequency report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--score_percentiles &lsquo;P1
[P2 ...]&Acirc;&acute; <br>
--score_percentiles default <br>
Enables the Spam Score Percentiles report. The arguments P1
... specify the percentiles shown in the report, and are
integers from 0 to 100 inclusive. The keyword <br>
default uses the built-in default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noscore_percentiles <br>
Disables the Spam Score Percentiles report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]sect_vars <br>
--show_sect_vars boolean <br>
Enables (disables) supplementing each Detailed section title
with the name of that section&rsquo;s level limiter. The
name displayed is the command line option (or
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file variable) used to limit that section&rsquo;s
output. With the large number of level limiters available in
amavis-logwatch, this a convenient mechanism for determining
<br>
exactly which level limiter affects a section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]startinfo <br>
--show_startinfo boolean <br>
Enables (disables) the Amavis startup report showing most
recent Amavis startup details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show_summary <br>
Enables (disables) displaying of the the Summary section of
the report. The variable Amavis_Show_Summary in used in a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog_name namepat <br>
Specifies the syslog service name that amavis-logwatch uses
to match syslog lines. Only log lines whose service name
matches the perl regular expression namepat will be <br>
used by amavis-logwatch; all non-matching lines are silently
ignored. This is useful when a pre-installed Amavis package
uses a name other than the default (amavis).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: if you use parenthesis in
your regular expression, be sure they are cloistering and
not capturing: use (?:pattern) instead of (pattern).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timings percent <br>
Enables the Amavis Scan Timings percentiles report. The
report can be top N-percent limited with the percent
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timings_percentiles &lsquo;P1
[P2 ...]&Acirc;&acute; <br>
Specifies the percentiles shown in the Scan Timings report.
The arguments P1 ... are integers from 0 to 100 inclusive.
Their order will be preserved in the report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notimings <br>
Disables the Amavis Scan Timings report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print amavis-logwatch version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level Limiters <br>
The output of every section in the Detailed report is
controlled by a level limiter. The name of the level limiter
variable will be output when the sect_vars option is set.
<br>
Level limiters are set either via command line in standalone
mode with --limit limiter=levelspec option, or via
configuration file variable $amavis_limiter=levelspec. Each
lim&acirc; <br>
iter requires a levelspec argument, which is described below
in LEVEL CONTROL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of level limiters is
shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whitelisted <br>
Messages that were (soft-)whitelisted. See also Blacklisted

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEVEL CONTROL <br>
The Detailed section of the report consists of a number of
sub-sections, each of which is controlled both globally and
independently. Two settings influence the output provided
<br>
in the Detailed report: a global detail level (specified
with --detail) which has final (big hammer) output-limiting
control over the Detailed section, and sub-section specific
<br>
detail settings (small hammer), which allow further limiting
of the output for a sub-section. Each sub-section may be
limited to a specific depth level, and each sub-level may
<br>
be limited with top N or threshold limits. The levelspec
argument to each of the level limiters listed above is used
to accomplish this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is probably best to continue
explanation of sub-level limiting with the following
well-known outline-style hierarchy, and some basic
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 0 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 3 <br>
level 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest form of output
limiting suppresses all output below a specified level. For
example, a levelspec set to &quot;2&quot; shows only data in
levels 0 through 2. Think of this as <br>
collapsing each sub-level 2 item, thus hiding all inferior
levels (3, 4, ...), to yield:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level 0 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 2 <br>
level 1 <br>
level 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the volume of output
in a section is too great, and it is useful to suppress any
data that does not exceed a certain threshold value.
Consider a dictionary spam <br>
attack, which produces very lengthy lists of hit-once
recipient email or IP addresses. Each sub-level in the
hierarchy can be threshold-limited by setting the levelspec
appro&acirc; <br>
priately. Setting levelspec to the value &quot;2::5&quot;
will suppress any data at level 2 that does not exceed a hit
count of 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perhaps producing a top N list,
such as top 10 senders, is desired. A levelspec of
&quot;3:10:&quot; limits level 3 data to only the top 10
hits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With those simple examples out
of the way, a levelspec is defined as a whitespace- or
comma-separated list of one or more of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Specifies the maximum level to
be output for this sub-section, with a range from 0 to 10.
if l is 0, no levels will be output, effectively disabling
the sub-section <br>
(level 0 data is already provided in the Summary report, so
level 1 is considered the first useful level in the Detailed
report). Higher values will produce output up to <br>
and including the specified level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l.n Same as above, with the
addition that n limits this section&rsquo;s level 1 output
to the top n items. The value for n can be any integer
greater than 1. (This form of limit&acirc; <br>
ing has less utility than the syntax shown below. It is
provided for backwards compatibility; users are encouraged
to use the syntax below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l:n:t This triplet specifies
level l, top n, and minimum threshold t. Each of the values
are integers, with l being the level limiter as described
above, n being a top n lim&acirc; <br>
iter for the level l, and t being the threshold limiter for
level l. When both n and t are specified, n has priority,
allowing top n lists (regardless of threshold <br>
value). If the value of l is omitted, the specified values
for n and/or t are used for all levels available in the
sub-section. This permits a simple form of wildcarding <br>
(eg. place minimum threshold limits on all levels). However,
specific limiters always override wildcard limiters. The
first form of level limiter may be included in lev&acirc;
<br>
elspec to restrict output, regardless of how many triplets
are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All three forms of limiters are
effective only when amavis-logwatch&rsquo;s detail level is
5 or greater (the Detailed section is not activated until
detail is at least 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the EXAMPLES section for
usage scenarios.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Amavis-logwatch can read configuration settings from a
configuration file. Essentially, any command line option can
be placed into a configuration file, and these settings are
<br>
read upon startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because amavis-logwatch can run
either standalone or within Logwatch, to minimize confusion,
amavis-logwatch inherits Logwatch&rsquo;s configuration file
syntax requirements and con&acirc; <br>
ventions. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; White space
lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lines beginning
with # are ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Settings are of
the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Spaces or tabs
on either side of the = character are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Any value
protected in double quotes will be case-preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All other
content is reduced to lowercase (non-preserving, case
insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All
amavis-logwatch configuration settings must be prefixed with
&quot;$amavis_&quot; or amavis-logwatch will ignore
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When running
under Logwatch, any values not prefixed with
&quot;$amavis_&quot; are consumed by Logwatch; it only
passes to amavis-logwatch (via environment variable)
settings it con&acirc; <br>
siders valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The values True
and Yes are converted to 1, and False and No are converted
to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Order of
settings is not preserved within a configuration file (since
settings are passed by Logwatch via environment variables,
which have no defined order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include a command line option
in a configuration file, prefix the command line option name
with the word &quot;$amavis_&quot;. The following
configuration file setting and command line <br>
option are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$amavis_Line_Style =
Truncate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line_style Truncate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level limiters are also prefixed
with $amavis_, but on the command line are specified with
the --limit option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$amavis_SpamBlocked = 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--limit SpamBlocked=2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of command line
options and configuration file processing occurs as follows:
1) The default configuration file is read if it exists and
no --config_file was specified <br>
on a command line. 2) Configuration files are read and
processed in the order found on the command line. 3) Command
line options override any options already set either via
<br>
command line or from any configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options are
interpreted when they are seen on the command line, and
later options will override previously set options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The amavis-logwatch utility exits with a status code of 0,
unless an error occurred, in which case a non-zero exit
status is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Running Standalone <br>
Note: amavis-logwatch reads its log data from one or more
named Amavis log files, or from STDIN. For brevity, where
required, the examples below use the word file as the
command <br>
line argument meaning /path/to/amavis.log. Obviously you
will need to substitute file with the appropriate path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run amavis-logwatch in
standalone mode, simply run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavis-logwatch file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A complete list of options and
basic usage is available via:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavis-logwatch --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a summary only report
of Amavis log data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavis-logwatch --detail 1
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce a summary report and
a one-level detail report for May 25th:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep &rsquo;May 25&rsquo; file |
amavis-logwatch --detail 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce only a top 10 list of
Sent email domains, the summary report and detailed reports
are first disabled. Since commands line options are read and
enabled left-to-right, <br>
the Sent section is re-enabled to level 1 with a level 1 top
10 limiter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavis-logwatch --nosummary
--nodetail --limit spamblocked &rsquo;1 1:10:&rsquo;
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command and its
sample output shows a more complex level limiter example.
The command gives the top 4 spam blocked recipients (level
1), and under with each recip&acirc; <br>
ient the top 2 sending IPs (level 2) and finally below that,
only envelope from addresses (level 3) with hit counts
greater than 6. Ellipses indicate top N or threshold-limited
<br>
data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavis-logwatch --nosummary
--nodetail --limit spamblocked &rsquo;1:4: 2:2: 3::6&rsquo;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running within Logwatch <br>
Note: Logwatch versions prior to 7.3.6, unless configured
otherwise, required the --print option to print to STDOUT
instead of sending reports via email. Since version 7.3.6,
<br>
STDOUT is the default output destination, and the --print
option has been replaced by --output stdout. Check your
configuration to determine where report output will be
directed, <br>
and add the appropriate option to the commands below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a summary report for
today&rsquo;s Amavis log data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch --service amavis
--range today --detail 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a report for
today&rsquo;s Amavis log data, with one level <br>
of detail in the Detailed section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch --service amavis
--range today --detail 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a report for yesterday,
with two levels of detail in the Detailed section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch --service amavis
--range yesterday --detail 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a report from Dec 12th
through Dec 14th, with four levels of detail in the Detailed
section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch --service amavis
--range &rsquo;between 12/12 and 12/14&rsquo; --detail 8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a report for today,
with all levels of detail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch --service amavis
--range today --detail 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as above, but leaves long
lines uncropped:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logwatch --service amavis
--range today --detail 11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amavis Log Level <br>
Amavis provides additional log information when the variable
$log_level is increased above the default 0 value. This
information is used by the amavis-logwatch utility to
pro&acirc; <br>
vide additional reports, not available with the default
$log_level=0 value. A $log_level of 2 is suggested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you prefer not to increase
the noise level in your main mail or Amavis logs, you can
configure syslog to log Amavis&rsquo; output to multiple log
files, where basic log entries are <br>
routed to your main mail log(s) and more detailed entries
routed to an Amavis-specific log file used to feed the
amavis-logwatch utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A convenient way to accomplish
this is to change the Amavis configuration variables in
amavisd.conf as shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavisd.conf: <br>
$log_level = 2; <br>
$syslog_facility = &rsquo;local5&rsquo;; <br>
$syslog_priority = &rsquo;debug&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This increases $log_level to 2,
and sends Amavis&rsquo; log entries to an alternate syslog
facility (eg. local5, user), which can then be routed to one
or more log files, including <br>
your main mail log file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syslog.conf: <br>
#mail.info -/var/log/maillog <br>
mail.info;local5.notice -/var/log/maillog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local5.info
-/var/log/amavisd-info.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amavis&rsquo; typical $log_level
0 messages will be directed to both your maillog and to the
amavisd-info.log file, but higher $log_level messages will
only be routed to the amavisd- <br>
info.log file. For additional information on Amavis&rsquo;
logging, search the file RELEASE_NOTES in the Amavis
distribution for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;syslog priorities are now
dynamically derived&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The amavis-logwatch program uses the following
(automatically set) environment variables when running under
Logwatch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGWATCH_DETAIL_LEVEL <br>
This is the detail level specified with the Logwatch command
line argument --detail or the Detail setting in the
...conf/services/amavis.conf configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGWATCH_DEBUG <br>
This is the debug level specified with the Logwatch command
line argument --debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amavis_xxx <br>
The Logwatch program passes all settings amavis_xxx in the
configuration file ...conf/services/amavis.conf to the
amavis filter (which is actually named
.../scripts/ser&acirc; <br>
vices/amavis) via environment variable.</p>
