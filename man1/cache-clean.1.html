<p>CACHE-CLEAN(1) NorduGrid Users Manual CACHE-CLEAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cache-clean - Administration tool for the A-REX cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cache-clean [-h] [-s] [-S] [-m NN -M NN] [-E N] [-D
debug_level] <br>
[-f space_command] [ -c &lt;arex_config_file&gt; |
&lt;dir1&gt; [&lt;dir2&gt; [...]] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cache-clean is a tool for administrators of ARC server
installations to safely remove A-REX cache data and to
provide an overview of the contents of the cache. It is used
by the <br>
A-REX to automatically manage cache contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two modes of operation
- printing statistics and deleting files. If -s is used,
then statistics are printed on each cache. If -m and -M are
used then files in each <br>
cache are deleted if the space used by the cache on the file
system is more than that given by -M, in the order of least
recently accessed, until the space used by the cache is <br>
equal to what is specified by -m. If -E is used, then all
files accessed less recently than the given time are
deleted. -E can be used in combination with -m and -M but
delet&acirc; <br>
ing files using -E is carried out first. If after this the
cache used space is still more than that given by -M then
cleaning according to those options is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the cache is on a file system
shared with other data then -S should be specified so that
the space used by the cache is calculated. Otherwise all the
used space on the file <br>
system is assumed to be for the cache. Using -S is slower so
should only be used when the cache is shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the &quot;df&quot;
command is used to determine total and (if -S is not
specified) used space. If this command is not supported on
the cache file system then -f can be used to <br>
specify an alternate command. The output of this command
must be &quot;total_bytes used_bytes&quot;, and so the
command would normally be a small script around the file
system space infor&acirc; <br>
mation tool. The cache directory is passed as the last
argument to this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cache directories are given by
dir1, dir2.. or taken from the config file specified by -c
or the ARC_CONFIG environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h - print short help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s - print cache statistics,
without deleting anything. The output displays for each
cache the number of deletable (and locked) files, the total
size of these files, the percent&acirc; <br>
age usage of the file system in which the cache is stored,
and a histogram of access times of the files in the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S - Calculate the size of the
cache instead of taking used space on the file system. This
should only be used when the cache file system is shared
with other data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M - the maximum used space (as
% of the file system) at which to start cleaning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m - the minimum used space (as
% of the file system) at which to stop cleaning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E - files accessed less
recently than the given time period will be deleted. Example
values of this option are 1800, 90s, 24h, 30d. The default
when no suffix is given is sec&acirc; <br>
onds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f - alternative command to
&quot;df&quot; for obtaining the file system total and used
space. The output of this command must be &quot;total_bytes
used_bytes&quot;. The cache directory is passed as <br>
the last argument to this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D - debug level. Possible
values are FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE or DEBUG.
Default level is INFO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c - path to an A-REX config
file, xml or ini format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool is run periodically by
the A-REX to keep the size of each cache within the limits
specified in the configuration file. Therefore cleaning
should not be performed manu&acirc; <br>
ally, unless the cache size needs to be reduced temporarily.
For performance reasons it may however be desirable to run
cache-clean independently on the machine hosting the cache
<br>
file system, if this is different from the A-REX host. The
most useful function for administrators is to give an
overview of the contents of the cache, using the -s
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within each cache directory
specified in the configuration file, there is a subdirectory
for data (data/) and one for per-job hard links (joblinks/).
See the A-REX Administra&acirc; <br>
tion Guide for more details. cache-clean should only operate
on the data subdirectory, therefore when giving dir
arguments they should be the top level cache directory.
cache- <br>
clean will then automatically only look at files within the
data directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
cache-clean -m20 -M30 -E30d -D VERBOSE -c /etc/arc.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cache directories are taken from
the configuration file /etc/arc.conf and all cache files
accessed more than 30 days ago are deleted. Then if the used
space in a cache is above <br>
30%, data is deleted until the used space reaches 20%.
Verbose debug output is enabled so information is output on
each file that is deleted.</p>
