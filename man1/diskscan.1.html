diskscan - scan a disk for failed and near failure sectors

<b>diskscan</b> [options...] <i>block_device</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>diskscan</b> is intended to check a disk and find any bad sectors already
  present and assess it for any possible sectors that are in the process of
  going bad. The operation is all read-only and can cause no direct damage to
  the data on the disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
diskscan reads the entire block device and notes the time it took to read a
  block. When there is an error it is immediately noted and also when there is a
  higher latency to read a block. A histogram of the block latency times is also
  given to assess the health of the disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output of diskscan will show any serious errors or very high latency and
  will also emit an histogram at the end of the run in the form:
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">

This means that all I/Os in this case were between 100 and 600 msec and there
  were 120 chunks being read. Current these chunks are 1MB in size.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> display verbose information from the workings of the
  scan use multiple times for increased verbosity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f</b>, <b>--fix</b> Attempt to fix areas that are nearing failure. This
  should only be attempted on an unmounted block device and never on an inuse
  filesystem or corruption is likely.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s &lt;mode&gt;</b>, <b>--scan &lt;mode&gt;</b> Scan mode can be either
  <b>seq</b> or <b>random</b>, random reduces the chance that the disk will be
  able spend time to recover data before we try to access a sector but the seeks
  add noise to the latency measurement. Sequential test is the default and
  random test is still experimental with regard to its usefulness.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-e &lt;size&gt;</b>, <b>--size &lt;size&gt;</b> Set the size in which the
  scan will be done, this must be a multiple of the sector size which is
  normally 512 bytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-o &lt;file&gt;</b>, <b>--output &lt;file&gt;</b> Set the output file that
  the scan will generate. This is a JSON file with the summary and details about
  the exceptional events found during the scan.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-r &lt;file&gt;</b>, <b>--raw-log &lt;file&gt;</b> Set the output file for
  the raw log which logs everything done and seen during the scan. This is a
  rather large file but it can help get the finer details of the scan progress
  and the disk behavior during the scan. This is too a JSON file.
