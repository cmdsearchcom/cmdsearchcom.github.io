<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
diskscan - scan a disk for failed and near failure
sectors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
diskscan [options...] block_device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
diskscan is intended to check a disk and find any bad
sectors already present and assess it for any possible
sectors that are in the process of going bad. The operation
is all <br>
read-only and can cause no direct damage to the data on the
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diskscan reads the entire block
device and notes the time it took to read a block. When
there is an error it is immediately noted and also when
there is a higher latency to read <br>
a block. A histogram of the block latency times is also
given to assess the health of the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of diskscan will show
any serious errors or very high latency and will also emit
an histogram at the end of the run in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I: Validating path /dev/sdg <br>
I: Opened disk /dev/sdg <br>

I: Closed disk /dev/sdg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that all I/Os in this
case were between 100 and 600 msec and there were 120 chunks
being read. Current these chunks are 1MB in size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v, --verbose display verbose information from the workings
of the scan use multiple times for increased verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fix Attempt to fix areas
that are nearing failure. This should only be attempted on
an unmounted block device and never on an inuse filesystem
or corruption is likely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;mode&gt;, --scan
&lt;mode&gt; Scan mode can be either seq or random, random
reduces the chance that the disk will be able spend time to
recover data before we try to access a sector <br>
but the seeks add noise to the latency measurement.
Sequential test is the default and random test is still
experimental with regard to its usefulness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;size&gt;, --size
&lt;size&gt; Set the size in which the scan will be done,
this must be a multiple of the sector size which is normally
512 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;file&gt;, --output
&lt;file&gt; Set the output file that the scan will
generate. This is a JSON file with the summary and details
about the exceptional events found during the scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;file&gt;, --raw-log
&lt;file&gt; Set the output file for the raw log which logs
everything done and seen during the scan. This is a rather
large file but it can help get the finer <br>
details of the scan progress and the disk behavior during
the scan. This is too a JSON file.</p>
