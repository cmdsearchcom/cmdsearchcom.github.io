<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5141delta - what is new for perl v5.14.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.0
release and the 5.14.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
No changes since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
No changes since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated Modules and Pragmata
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; B::Deparse has been upgraded from version
1.03 to 1.04, to address two regressions in Perl 5.14.0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deparsing of the
&quot;glob&quot; operator and its diamond
(&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;) form now works again. [perl
#90898]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The presence of subroutines
named &quot;::::&quot; or &quot;::::::&quot; no longer
causes B::Deparse to hang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pod::Perldoc has
been upgraded from version 3.15_03 to 3.15_04.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It corrects the search paths on
VMS. [perl #90640]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed Modules and Pragmata
<br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
New Documentation <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>
perlfunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;given&quot;, &quot;when&quot; and &quot;default&quot;
are now listed in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documentation
for &quot;use&quot; now includes a pointer to if.pm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perllol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perllol has been
expanded with examples using the new &quot;push
$scalar&quot; syntax introduced in Perl 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The explanation
of bitwise operators has been expanded to explain how they
work on Unicode strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The section on
the triple-dot or yada-yada operator has been moved up, as
it used to separate two closely related sections about the
comma operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; More examples
for &quot;m//g&quot; have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;&lt;&lt;O&quot; here-doc syntax has been
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlrun</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlrun has
undergone a significant clean-up. Most notably, the -0x...
form of the -0 flag has been clarified, and the final
section on environment variables has been <br>
corrected and expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The invocation
documentation for &quot;WIFEXITED&quot;,
&quot;WEXITSTATUS&quot;, &quot;WIFSIGNALED&quot;,
&quot;WTERMSIG&quot;, &quot;WIFSTOPPED&quot;, and
&quot;WSTOPSIG&quot; was corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics <br>
The following additions or changes have been made to
diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error
messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see
perldiag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Diagnostics <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing Diagnostics
<br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; regexp.h has been modified for compatibility
with GCC&rsquo;s &quot;-Werror&quot; option, as used by some
projects that include perl&rsquo;s header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Some test failures in
dist/Locale-Maketext/t/09_compile.t that could occur
depending on the environment have been fixed. [perl
#89896]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A watchdog timer
for t/re/re.t was lengthened to accommodate SH-4 systems
which were unable to complete the tests before the previous
timer ran out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
New Platforms <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform-Specific Notes <br>
Solaris</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documentation
listing the Solaris packages required to build Perl on
Solaris 9 and Solaris 10 has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mac OS X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The lib/locale.t
test script has been updated to work on the upcoming Lion
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mac OS X
specific compilation instructions have been clarified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ubuntu Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The ODBM_File
installation process has been updated with the new library
paths on Ubuntu natty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The compiled representation of formats is
now stored via the mg_ptr of their PERL_MAGIC_fm. Previously
it was stored in the string buffer, beyond SvLEN(), the
regular end of <br>
the string. SvCOMPILED() and SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist
solely for compatibility for XS code. The first is always 0,
the other two now no-ops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A bug has been fixed that would cause a
&quot;Use of freed value in iteration&quot; error if the
next two hash elements that would be iterated over are
deleted. [perl #85026]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Passing the same
constant subroutine to both &quot;index&quot; and
&quot;formline&quot; no longer causes one or the other to
fail. [perl #89218]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 5.14.0
introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
classes such as &quot;[648</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An edge case in
regular expression matching could potentially loop. This
happened only under &quot;/i&quot; in bracketed character
classes that have characters with multi-character <br>
folds, and the target string to match against includes the
first portion of the fold, followed by another character
that has a multi-character fold that begins with the <br>
remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;s+DF}&quot; =~
/[F}foo]/i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is one such case. &quot;&quot;
folds to &quot;ss&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several Unicode
case-folding bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The new (in
5.14.0) regular expression modifier &quot;/a&quot; when
repeated like &quot;/aa&quot; forbids the characters outside
the ASCII range that match characters inside that range from
<br>
matching under &quot;/i&quot;. This did not work under some
circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ELVIN SIGN}&quot; =~
/k|foo/iaa;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">succeeded inappropriately. This
is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a case
where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read
from when parsing a here document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.14.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bo Lindbergh, Claudio Ramirez,
Craig A. Berry, David Leadbeater, Father Chrysostomos, Jesse
Vincent, Jim Cromie, Justin Case, Karl Williamson, Leo
Lapworth, Nicholas Clark, <br>
Nobuhiro Iwamatsu, smash, Tom Christiansen, Ton Hospel,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
<br>
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
<br>
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
