<p>GERMINATE(1) Ubuntu General Commands Manual
GERMINATE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
germinate &acirc; expand dependencies in a list of seed
packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
germinate [-v] [-S source] [-s dist] [-m mirror] [-d
dist,...] [-a arch] [-c component,...]
[--vcs={auto|bzr|git}] [--no-rdepends] [--no-installer]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
germinate is a program to help with the maintenance of large
software distributions. It takes a list of seed packages and
a mirror of the distribution, and produces outputs with <br>
the seed packages and their dependencies and
build-dependencies expanded out in full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seeds <br>
The contents of the Ubuntu distribution, and others, are
managed by means of seeds. At their simplest, these are
lists of packages which are considered important to have in
the <br>
main component of the distribution, without explicitly
listing all their dependencies and build-dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seed lists are typically divided
up by category: a base or minimal seed might list the core
set of packages required to make the system run at all,
while a desktop seed might list <br>
the set of packages installed as part of a default desktop
installation. germinate takes these seeds, adds their
dependency trees, and produces an output for each seed which
con&acirc; <br>
tains a dependency-expanded list of package names. These
outputs may be handed on to archive maintenance or
CD-building tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some seeds may inherit from
other seeds: they rely on those seeds to be installed. For
example, a desktop seed will typically inherit from a
minimal seed. germinate understands <br>
these inheritance relationships. If a package in the desktop
seed depends on &acirc;foo&acirc;, but &acirc;foo&acirc; is
already part of the minimal seed or dependency list, then
&acirc;foo&acirc; will not be added <br>
to the desktop output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seeds are stored in text files
downloaded from a given URL. Lines not beginning with
&acirc; * &acirc; (wiki-style list markup) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seed entries may simply consist
of a package name, or may include any of the following
special syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% Seed entries beginning with
&acirc;%&acirc; expand to all binaries from the given source
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] Seed entries may be
followed with &acirc; [arch1 arch2 ...]&acirc; to indicate
that they should only be used on the given architectures, or
with &acirc; [!arch1 !arch2 ...]&acirc; to indicate that
<br>
they should not be used on the given architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(...) Seed entries in
parentheses indicate that the seed should be treated as a
recommendation of metapackages generated from this seed,
rather than as a dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Seed entries beginning with
&acirc;!&acirc; cause the given package to be blacklisted
from the given seed and any seeds from which it inherits;
this may be followed by &acirc;%&acirc; as above to <br>
blacklist all binaries from the given source package. Note
that this may result in uninstallable packages whose
dependencies have been blacklisted, so use this feature <br>
sparingly. The purpose of a blacklist is to make it obvious
when a package that is not supposed to be installed ends up
in germinate&rsquo;s output, so that package relation&acirc;
<br>
ships can be fixed to stop that happening. It is not
intended for the purpose of working around buggy package
relationships, and attempts to do so will not work because
<br>
apt has no way to know about blacklist entries in seeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key: value <br>
Some seeds also contain headers at the top of the file, in
&acirc;key: value&acirc; format. For the most part, these
are not parsed by germinate itself. The Ubuntu tasksel
package <br>
uses keys beginning with &acirc;Task-&acirc; to define
fields of similar names in its .desc files.
germinate-update-metapackage(1) uses some of these headers
to reduce the need for <br>
fragile configuration; see its documentation for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A STRUCTURE file alongside the
seeds lists their inheritance relationships. It may also
include lines beginning with &acirc;include&acirc;, causing
other collections of seeds to be included <br>
as if they were part of the collection currently being
germinated, or lines beginning with &acirc;feature&acirc;,
which set flags for the processing of seeds. The only flag
currently defined <br>
is &acirc;follow-recommends&acirc;, which causes germinate
to treat Recommends fields as if they were Depends.
(Features may also be set on a per-seed basis using lines
beginning with <br>
&acirc; * Feature:&acirc; in the seed file; here,
&acirc;no-follow-recommends&acirc; is also supported to
allow Recommends-following to be turned off for individual
seeds.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build-dependencies and
&acirc;supported&acirc; <br>
There is typically no need for a default desktop
installation to contain all the compilers and development
libraries needed to build itself from source; if nothing
else, it would <br>
consume much more space. Nevertheless, it is normally a
requirement for the maintainers of a distribution to support
all the packages necessary to build that distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">germinate therefore does not add
all the packages that result from following
build-dependencies of seed packages and of their
dependencies (the &acirc;build-dependency tree&acirc;) to
every <br>
output, unless they are also in the seed or in the
dependency list. Instead, it adds them to the output for the
last seed in the STRUCTURE file, conventionally called
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like any other seed, the
supported seed may contain its own list of packages. It is
common to provide support for many software packages which
are not in the default installation, <br>
such as debugging libraries, optimised kernels, alternative
language support, and the like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outputs <br>
The output files are named after the seed to which they
correspond. An additional output file is needed for
supported, namely &acirc;supported+build-depends&acirc;,
which contains the sup&acirc; <br>
ported list and the build-depends lists of the other seeds
all joined together. An &acirc;all&acirc; output is produced
to represent the entire archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some other files are produced
for occasional use by experts. See the README file for full
details on these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose when processing seeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --seed-source source,...
<br>
Fetch seeds from the specified sources. The default is
http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/seeds/, or
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/
if <br>
the --vcs=bzr option is used, or
git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/
if the --vcs=git option is used. You may use file:// URLs
here to fetch seeds <br>
from the local file system; for example, if your seeds are
stored in /home/username/seeds/debian.unstable, then you
would use the options -S file:///home/username/seeds/ -s
<br>
debian.unstable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --seed-dist dist <br>
Fetch seeds for distribution dist. The default is
ubuntu.zesty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When fetching seeds from git,
the part after the rightmost &acirc;.&acirc; character, if
any, is treated as the branch name to check out; this rather
strange style is for backward com&acirc; <br>
patibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mirror mirror <br>
Get package lists from mirror. The default is
http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/. May be supplied multiple
times; the newest version of each package across all
archives will <br>
win.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source-mirror mirror <br>
Get source package lists from mirror. The default is to use
package lists mirrors. May be supplied multiple times; the
newest version of each source package across all ar&acirc;
<br>
chives will win.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dist dist,... <br>
Operate on the specified distributions. The default is
zesty. Listing multiple distributions may be useful, for
example, when examining both a released distribution and its
<br>
security updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --arch arch <br>
Operate on architecture arch. The default is i386.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --components component,...
<br>
Operate on the specified components. The default is
main.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--vcs={auto|bzr|git} <br>
Check out seeds from a version control system rather than
fetching them directly from a URL. Requires bzr or git, as
appropriate, to be installed. For bzr, use the branch <br>
found at seed-source/seed-dist; for git, remove the part
after the rightmost &acirc;.&acirc; character of seed-dist
and use it as the branch name to check out from <br>
seed-source/remainder-of-seed-dist. For auto, guess the
version control system to use from seed-source (trying both
in ambiguous cases) and then proceed as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bzr <br>
Check out seeds from the bzr branch found at
seed-source/seed-dist rather than fetching them directly
from a URL. Requires bzr to be installed. This option is
deprecated <br>
and is retained for backward compatibility; use --vcs=bzr
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-rdepends <br>
Disable reverse-dependency calculations. These calculations
cause a large number of small files to be written out in the
rdepends/ directory, and may take some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-installer <br>
Do not consider debian-installer udeb packages. While
generally not the desired outcome, sometimes you might wish
to omit consideration of installer packages when processing
<br>
your seeds, perhaps if sending the output directly to the
package manager on an already-installed system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--seed-packages parent/pkg,...
<br>
Treat each pkg as a seed by itself, inheriting from parent
(i.e. assuming that all packages in the parent seed are
already installed while calculating the additional
depen&acirc; <br>
dencies of pkg). This allows the use of germinate to
calculate the dependencies of individual extra packages. For
example, --seed-packages desktop/epiphany-browser will <br>
create an epiphany-browser output file listing the
additional packages that need to be installed over and above
the desktop seed in order to install epiphany-browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--always-follow-build-depends
<br>
Always follow Build-Depends in all seeds, regardless of seed
feature flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The wiki-style markup in seeds was inherited from an early
implementation, and is a wart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">germinate can sometimes be
confused by complicated situations involving the order in
which it encounters dependencies on virtual packages.
Explicit entries in seeds may be <br>
required to work around this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of installer packages
(udebs) is complicated, poorly documented, and doesn&rsquo;t
always work quite right: in particular, packages
aren&rsquo;t demoted to the supported seed when <br>
they should be.</p>
