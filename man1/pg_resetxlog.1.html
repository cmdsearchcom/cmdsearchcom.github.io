<b>pg_resetxlog</b> clears the write-ahead log (WAL) and optionally resets some
  other control information stored in the pg_control file. This function is
  sometimes needed if these files have become corrupted. It should be used only
  as a last resort, when the server will not start due to such corruption.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After running this command, it should be possible to start the server, but bear
  in mind that the database might contain inconsistent data due to
  partially-committed transactions. You should immediately dump your data, run
  <b>initdb</b>, and reload. After reload, check for inconsistencies and repair
  as needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This utility can only be run by the user who installed the server, because it
  requires read/write access to the data directory. For safety reasons, you must
  specify the data directory on the command line. <b>pg_resetxlog</b> does not
  use the environment variable <b>PGDATA</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>pg_resetxlog</b> complains that it cannot determine valid data for
  pg_control, you can force it to proceed anyway by specifying the <b>-f</b>
  (force) option. In this case plausible values will be substituted for the
  missing data. Most of the fields can be expected to match, but manual
  assistance might be needed for the next OID, next transaction ID and epoch,
  next multitransaction ID and offset, and WAL starting address fields. These
  fields can be set using the options discussed below. If you are not able to
  determine correct values for all these fields, <b>-f</b> can still be used,
  but the recovered database must be treated with even more suspicion than
  usual: an immediate dump and reload is imperative. <i>Do not</i> execute any
  data-modifying operations in the database before you dump, as any such action
  is likely to make the corruption worse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-o</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-O</b>, and <b>-l</b> options
  allow the next OID, next transaction ID, next transaction ID's epoch, next
  multitransaction ID, next multitransaction offset, and WAL starting address
  values to be set manually. These are only needed when <b>pg_resetxlog</b> is
  unable to determine appropriate values by reading pg_control. Safe values can
  be determined as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;A safe value for the next transaction
  ID ( <b>-x</b>) can be determined by looking for the numerically largest file
  name in the directory pg_clog under the data directory, adding one, and then
  multiplying by 1048576. Note that the file names are in hexadecimal. It is
  usually easiest to specify the option value in hexadecimal too. For example,
  if 0011 is the largest entry in pg_clog, -x 0x1200000 will work (five trailing
  zeroes provide the proper multiplier).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;A safe value for the next
  multitransaction ID ( <b>-m</b>) can be determined by looking for the
  numerically largest file name in the directory pg_multixact/offsets under the
  data directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536. As above, the file
  names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way to do this is to specify the
  option value in hexadecimal and add four zeroes.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;A safe value for the next
  multitransaction offset ( <b>-O</b>) can be determined by looking for the
  numerically largest file name in the directory pg_multixact/members under the
  data directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536. As above, the file
  names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way to do this is to specify the
  option value in hexadecimal and add four zeroes.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;The WAL starting address (<b>-l</b>)
  should be larger than any WAL segment file name currently existing in the
  directory pg_xlog under the data directory. These names are also in
  hexadecimal and have three parts. The first part is the &#x201C;timeline
  ID&#x201D; and should usually be kept the same. Do not choose a value larger
  than 255 (0xFF) for the third part; instead increment the second part and
  reset the third part to 0. For example, if 00000001000000320000004A is the
  largest entry in pg_xlog, -l 0x1,0x32,0x4B will work; but if the largest entry
  is 000000010000003A000000FF, choose -l 0x1,0x3B,0x0 or more.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pg_resetxlog</b> itself looks at the files in pg_xlog and chooses a default
  <b>-l</b> setting beyond the last existing file name. Therefore, manual
  adjustment of <b>-l</b> should only be needed if you are aware of WAL segment
  files that are not currently present in pg_xlog, such as entries in an offline
  archive; or if the contents of pg_xlog have been lost entirely.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;There is no comparably easy way to
  determine a next OID that's beyond the largest one in the database, but
  fortunately it is not critical to get the next-OID setting right.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;The transaction ID epoch is not
  actually stored anywhere in the database except in the field that is set by
  <b>pg_resetxlog</b>, so any value will work so far as the database itself is
  concerned. You might need to adjust this value to ensure that replication
  systems such as Slony-I work correctly &#x2014; if so, an appropriate value
  should be obtainable from the state of the downstream replicated
  database.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-n</b> (no operation) option instructs <b>pg_resetxlog</b> to print the
  values reconstructed from pg_control and then exit without modifying anything.
  This is mainly a debugging tool, but can be useful as a sanity check before
  allowing <b>pg_resetxlog</b> to proceed for real.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-V</b> and <b>--version</b> options print the pg_resetxlog version and
  exit. The options <b>-?</b> and <b>--help</b> show supported arguments, and
  exit.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
This command must not be used when the server is running. <b>pg_resetxlog</b>
  will refuse to start up if it finds a server lock file in the data directory.
  If the server crashed then a lock file might have been left behind; in that
  case you can remove the lock file to allow <b>pg_resetxlog</b> to run. But
  before you do so, make doubly certain that there is no server process still
  alive.</div>
