<p>PG_RESETXLOG(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_RESETXLOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_resetxlog - reset the write-ahead log and other control
information of a PostgreSQL database cluster</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_resetxlog [-f] [-n] [-o oid] [-x xid] [-e xid_epoch] [-m
mxid] [-O mxoff] [-l timelineid,fileid,seg] datadir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_resetxlog clears the write-ahead log (WAL) and optionally
resets some other control information stored in the
pg_control file. This function is sometimes needed if these
files <br>
have become corrupted. It should be used only as a last
resort, when the server will not start due to such
corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running this command, it
should be possible to start the server, but bear in mind
that the database might contain inconsistent data due to
partially-committed transactions. <br>
You should immediately dump your data, run initdb, and
reload. After reload, check for inconsistencies and repair
as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can only be run by
the user who installed the server, because it requires
read/write access to the data directory. For safety reasons,
you must specify the data <br>
directory on the command line. pg_resetxlog does not use the
environment variable PGDATA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pg_resetxlog complains that
it cannot determine valid data for pg_control, you can force
it to proceed anyway by specifying the -f (force) option. In
this case plausible <br>
values will be substituted for the missing data. Most of the
fields can be expected to match, but manual assistance might
be needed for the next OID, next transaction ID and <br>
epoch, next multitransaction ID and offset, and WAL starting
address fields. These fields can be set using the options
discussed below. If you are not able to determine correct
<br>
values for all these fields, -f can still be used, but the
recovered database must be treated with even more suspicion
than usual: an immediate dump and reload is imperative. Do
<br>
not execute any data-modifying operations in the database
before you dump, as any such action is likely to make the
corruption worse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o, -x, -e, -m, -O, and -l
options allow the next OID, next transaction ID, next
transaction ID&rsquo;s epoch, next multitransaction ID, next
multitransaction offset, and WAL <br>
starting address values to be set manually. These are only
needed when pg_resetxlog is unable to determine appropriate
values by reading pg_control. Safe values can be determined
<br>
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A safe value for
the next transaction ID (-x) can be determined by looking
for the numerically largest file name in the directory
pg_clog under the data directory, adding <br>
one, and then multiplying by 1048576. Note that the file
names are in hexadecimal. It is usually easiest to specify
the option value in hexadecimal too. For example, if 0011
<br>
is the largest entry in pg_clog, -x 0x1200000 will work
(five trailing zeroes provide the proper multiplier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A safe value for
the next multitransaction ID (-m) can be determined by
looking for the numerically largest file name in the
directory pg_multixact/offsets under the data <br>
directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536. As
above, the file names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way
to do this is to specify the option value in hexadecimal
<br>
and add four zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A safe value for
the next multitransaction offset (-O) can be determined by
looking for the numerically largest file name in the
directory pg_multixact/members under the data <br>
directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536. As
above, the file names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way
to do this is to specify the option value in hexadecimal
<br>
and add four zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The WAL starting
address (-l) should be larger than any WAL segment file name
currently existing in the directory pg_xlog under the data
directory. These names are also in <br>
hexadecimal and have three parts. The first part is the
&acirc;timeline ID&acirc; and should usually be kept the
same. Do not choose a value larger than 255 (0xFF) for the
third part; <br>
instead increment the second part and reset the third part
to 0. For example, if 00000001000000320000004A is the
largest entry in pg_xlog, -l 0x1,0x32,0x4B will work; but if
<br>
the largest entry is 000000010000003A000000FF, choose -l
0x1,0x3B,0x0 or more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
pg_resetxlog itself looks at the files in pg_xlog and
chooses a default -l setting beyond the last existing file
name. Therefore, manual adjustment of -l should only be <br>
needed if you are aware of WAL segment files that are not
currently present in pg_xlog, such as entries in an offline
archive; or if the contents of pg_xlog have been <br>
lost entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There is no
comparably easy way to determine a next OID that&rsquo;s
beyond the largest one in the database, but fortunately it
is not critical to get the next-OID setting right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The transaction
ID epoch is not actually stored anywhere in the database
except in the field that is set by pg_resetxlog, so any
value will work so far as the database itself <br>
is concerned. You might need to adjust this value to ensure
that replication systems such as Slony-I work correctly
&acirc; if so, an appropriate value should be obtainable
from <br>
the state of the downstream replicated database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n (no operation) option
instructs pg_resetxlog to print the values reconstructed
from pg_control and then exit without modifying anything.
This is mainly a debugging tool, <br>
but can be useful as a sanity check before allowing
pg_resetxlog to proceed for real.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V and --version options
print the pg_resetxlog version and exit. The options -? and
--help show supported arguments, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This command must not be used when the server is running.
pg_resetxlog will refuse to start up if it finds a server
lock file in the data directory. If the server crashed then
a <br>
lock file might have been left behind; in that case you can
remove the lock file to allow pg_resetxlog to run. But
before you do so, make doubly certain that there is no
server <br>
process still alive.</p>
