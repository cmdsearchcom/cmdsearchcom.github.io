<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hspell - Hebrew spellchecker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hspell [ -acDhHilnsvV ] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hspell tries to find incorrectly spelled Hebrew words in its
input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the traditional Unix
spell(1), hspell outputs the sorted list of incorrect words,
and does not have a more friendly interface for making
corrections for you. However, unlike <br>
spell(1), hspell can suggest possible corrections for some
spelling errors. Such suggestions can be enabled with the -c
(correct) and -n (notes) options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hspell currently expects
ISO-8859-8-encoded input files. Non-Hebrew characters in the
input files are ignored, allowing the easy spellchecking of
Hebrew-English texts, as well as <br>
HTML or TeX files. If files using a different encoding
(e.g., UTF-8) are to be checked, they must be converted
first to ISO-8859-8 (e.g., see iconv(1), recode(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output will also be in
ISO-8859-8 encoding, in so-called &quot;logical order&quot;,
so it is normally useful to pipe it to bidiv(1) before
viewing, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hspell -c filename | bidiv |
less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no input file is given,
hspell reads from its standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v If the -v option is given, hspell prints emacs-oriented
version information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Repetition of the -v option
causes hspell to also show some information on which
optional features were enabled at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V With the -V option, hspell
prints true and human-oriented version information and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c If the -c option is given,
hspell will suggest corrections for misspelled words,
whenever it can find such corrections. The correction
mechanism in this release is espe&acirc; <br>
cially good at finding corrections for incorrect niqqud-less
spellings, with missing or extra
&rsquo;immot-qri&rsquo;a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The -n option will give some
longer &quot;notes&quot; about certain spelling errors,
explaining why these are indeed errors (or in what cases
using this word is in fact correct). It <br>
is recommend to combine the two options, -cn for maximal
correction help from hspell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l The -l (linguistic
information) option will explain for each correct word why
it was recognized (show the basic noun, verb, etc., that
this inflection relates to, and its <br>
tense, gender, associated Kinnuy, or other relevant
information)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Hspell was built without
morphological analysis support, this option will only show
the correct splits of the given word into prefix + word, as
the full information <br>
incurs a 4-fold increase in the installation size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Giving the -c option in addition
to -l results in special behavior. In that case hspell
suggests &quot;corrections&quot; to every word (regardless
if they are in the dictionary or <br>
not), and shows the linguistic information on all those
words. This can be useful for a reader application, which
may also want to be able to understand misspellings and <br>
their possible meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Normally, the words deemed
spelling mistakes are shown in alphabetical order. The -s
option orders them by severity, i.e., the errors that most
frequently appear in the <br>
document are shown first. This option is most useful for
people helping to build hspell&rsquo;s word list, and are
looking for common correct words that hspell does not know
<br>
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a With the -a option, hspell
tries to emulate (as little as possible of) ispell&rsquo;s
pipe interface. This allows Lyx, Emacs, Geresh and KDE to
use hspell as an external spell- <br>
checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This option only has any
effect when used together with the -a option. Normally,
hspell -a only checks the spelling of Hebrew words. If the
given file also contains non- <br>
Hebrew words (such as English words), these are simply
ignored. Adding the -i option tells hspell to pass the
non-Hebrew words to ispell(1), and return its answer as an
<br>
answer from hspell. This allows conveniently spell-checking
mixed Hebrew-English documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running hspell with the program
name hspell-i also enables the -i option. This is a useful
trick when an application expects just the name of a
spell-checking program, and <br>
adds only the &quot;-a&quot; option (without giving the user
an option to also add &quot;-i&quot;). The multispell script
supplied with hspell serves a similar purpose, with more
control over <br>
encodings and which spell-checker to run for non-Hebrew
words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H By default, Hspell does not
allow the He Ha-sh&rsquo;ela prefix. This is because this
prefix is not normally used in modern Hebrew, and generates
many false-negatives (errors, <br>
like He followed by a possessed noun, are thought to be
correct). The -H option nevertheless tells Hspell to allow
this prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D base <br>
Load the word lists from the given base pathname, rather
than from the compiled-in default path. This is mostly used
for testing Hspell, when the dictionaries have been <br>
compiled in the current directory and hspell is run as
&quot;hspell -Dhebrew.wgz&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -B, -m, -T, -C, -S, -P, -p,
-w, and -W <br>
These options are passed to hspell by lyx or other
applications, thinking they are talking to ispell. These
options are cordially ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPELLING STANDARD <br>
Hspell was designed to be 100% and strictly compliant with
the official niqqud-less spelling rules (&quot;Ha-ktiv
Khasar Ha-niqqud&quot;, colloquially known as &quot;Ktiv
Male&quot;) published by <br>
the Academy of the Hebrew Language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is both an advantage and a
disadvantage, depending on your viewpoint. It&rsquo;s an
advantage because it encourages a correct and consistent
spelling style throughout your writ&acirc; <br>
ing. It is a disadvantage, because a few of the
Academia&rsquo;s official spelling decisions are relatively
unknown to the general public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of Hspell (and all Hebrew
writers, for that matter) are encouraged to read the
Academia&rsquo;s official niqqud-less spelling rules (which
are printed at the end of most modern <br>
Hebrew dictionaries, and an abridged version is available in
http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision4.html). Users are
also encouraged to refer to Hebrew dictionaries which use
<br>
the niqqud-less spelling (such as Millon Ha-hove, Rav Milim,
and the new Even Shoshan).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hspell&rsquo;s distribution (and
Web site) also include a document, niqqudless.odt, which
explains Hspell&rsquo;s spelling standard in detail (in
Hebrew). It explains both the overall prin&acirc; <br>
ciples, and why specific words are spelled the way they
are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A future release may include an
option for alternative spelling standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEHIND THE SCENES <br>
The hspell program itself is mostly a simple (but efficient)
program that checks input words against a long list of valid
words. The real &quot;brains&quot; behind it are the word
lists <br>
(dictionary) provided by the Hspell project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for this dictionary to
be completely free of other people&rsquo;s copyright
restrictions, the Hspell project is a clean-room
implementation, not based on pre-existing word <br>
lists or spell checkers, or on copying of printed
dictionaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The word list is also not based
on automatic scanning of available Hebrew documents (such as
online newspapers), because there is no way to guarantee
that such a list will be <br>
correct, complete, or consistent in its spelling
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, our idea was to write
programs which know how to correctly inflect Hebrew nouns
and conjugate Hebrew verbs. The input to these programs is a
list of noun stems and verb <br>
roots, plus hints needed for the correct inflection when
these cannot be figured out automatically. Most of the
effort that went into the Hspell project went into building
these <br>
input files. Then, &quot;word list generators&quot; (written
in Perl, and are also part of the Hspell project) create the
complete inflected word list that will be used by the
spellcheck&acirc; <br>
ing program, hspell. This generation process is only done
once, when building hspell from source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These lists, before and after
inflection, may be useful for much more than spellchecking.
Morphological analysis (which hspell provides with the -l
option) is one example. For <br>
more ideas, see Hspell project&rsquo;s Web site, at
http://ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.hspell_words, ./hspell_words <br>
These files, if they exist, should contain a list of Hebrew
words that hspell will also accept as correct words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only these words
exactly will be added - they are not inflected, and prefixes
are not automatically allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <br>
The hspell utility and the linguistic databases behind it
(collectively called &quot;the Hspell project&quot;) were
created by Nadav Har&rsquo;El
&lt;nyh@math.technion.ac.il&gt; and by Dan Kenigsberg <br>
&lt;danken@cs.technion.ac.il&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although we wrote all of
Hspell&rsquo;s code ourselves, we are truly indebted to the
old-style &quot;open source&quot; pioneers - people who
wrote books instead of hiding their knowledge in pro&acirc;
<br>
prietary software. For the correct noun inflections, Dr.
Shaul Barkali&rsquo;s &quot;The Complete Noun Book&quot; has
been a great help. Prof. Uzzi Ornan&rsquo;s booklet
&quot;Verb Conjugation in Flow <br>
Charts&quot; has been instrumental in the implementation of
verb conjugation, and Barkali&rsquo;s &quot;The Complete
Verb Book&quot; was used too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During our work we have
extensively used a number of Hebrew dictionaries, including
Even Shoshan, Millon Ha-hove and Rav-Milim, to ensure the
correctness of certain words. Vari&acirc; <br>
ous Hebrew newspapers and books, both printed and online,
were used for inspiration and for finding words we still do
not recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We wish to thank Cilla Tuviana
and Dr. Zvi Har&rsquo;El for their assistance with some
grammatical questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several other people helped us
in various releases, with suggestions, fixes or patches -
they are listed in the WHATSNEW file in the
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This manual page is in English.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For GUI-lovers, hspell&rsquo;s
user interface is an abomination. However, as more and more
applications learn to interface with hspell, and as
Hspell&rsquo;s data becomes available in multi- <br>
lingual spellcheckers (such as aspell and hunspell), this
will no longer be an issue. See http://hspell.ivrix.org.il/
for instructions on how to use Hspell in a variety of
appli&acirc; <br>
cations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hspell&rsquo;s being limited to
the ISO-8859-8 encoding, and not recognizing UTF-8 or even
CP1255 (including niqqud), is an anachronism today.</p>
