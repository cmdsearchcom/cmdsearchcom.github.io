<b>hspell</b> [ <b>-acDhHilnsvV</b> ] <b>[</b><i>file...</i><b>]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>hspell</b> tries to find incorrectly spelled Hebrew words in its input files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like the traditional Unix spell(1), <b>hspell</b> outputs the sorted list of
  incorrect words, and does not have a more friendly interface for making
  corrections for you. However, unlike spell(1), <b>hspell</b> can suggest
  possible corrections for some spelling errors. Such suggestions can be enabled
  with the <b>-c</b> (correct) and <b>-n</b> (notes) options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Hspell</b> currently expects ISO-8859-8-encoded input files. Non-Hebrew
  characters in the input files are ignored, allowing the easy spellchecking of
  Hebrew-English texts, as well as HTML or TeX files. If files using a different
  encoding (e.g., UTF-8) are to be checked, they must be converted first to
  ISO-8859-8 (e.g., see iconv(1), recode(1)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output will also be in ISO-8859-8 encoding, in so-called &quot;logical
  order&quot;, so it is normally useful to pipe it to bidiv(1) before viewing,
  as in:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>hspell -c filename | bidiv | less</b></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no input file is given, <b>hspell</b> reads from its standard input.

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-vv</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Repetition of the <b>-v</b> option causes <b>hspell</b> to

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the <b>-c</b> option is given, <b>hspell</b> will
      suggest corrections for misspelled words, whenever it can find such
      corrections. The correction mechanism in this release is especially good
      at finding corrections for incorrect niqqud-less spellings, with missing
      or extra 'immot-qri'a.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>-n</b> option will give some longer
      &quot;notes&quot; about certain spelling errors, explaining why these are
      indeed errors (or in what cases using this word is in fact correct). It is
      recommend to combine the two options, <b>-cn</b> for maximal correction
      help from <b>hspell</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>-l</b> (linguistic information) option will explain
      for each <i>correct</i> word why it was recognized (show the basic noun,
      verb, etc., that this inflection relates to, and its tense, gender,
      associated Kinnuy, or other relevant information)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If Hspell was built without morphological analysis support, this option will
      only show the correct splits of the given word into prefix + word, as the
      full information incurs a 4-fold increase in the installation size.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Giving the <b>-c</b> option in addition to <b>-l</b> results in special
      behavior. In that case <b>hspell</b> suggests &quot;corrections&quot; to
      every word (regardless if they are in the dictionary or not), and shows
      the linguistic information on all those words. This can be useful for a
      reader application, which may also want to be able to understand
      misspellings and their possible meanings.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally, the words deemed spelling mistakes are shown in
      alphabetical order. The <b>-s</b> option orders them by <i>severity</i>,
      i.e., the errors that most frequently appear in the document are shown
      first. This option is most useful for people helping to build
      <b>hspell</b>'s word list, and are looking for common correct words that
      <b>hspell</b> does not know yet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With the <b>-a</b> option, <b>hspell</b> tries to emulate
      (as little as possible of) <b>ispell's</b> pipe interface. This allows
      <b>Lyx, Emacs, Geresh</b> and <b>KDE</b> to use <b>hspell</b> as an
      external spell-checker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option only has any effect when used together with the
      <b>-a</b> option. Normally, <b>hspell -a</b> only checks the spelling of
      Hebrew words. If the given file also contains non-Hebrew words (such as
      English words), these are simply ignored. Adding the <b>-i</b> option
      tells <b>hspell</b> to pass the non-Hebrew words to <b>ispell</b>(1), and
      return its answer as an answer from <b>hspell</b>. This allows
      conveniently spell-checking mixed Hebrew-English documents.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Running <b>hspell</b> with the program name <b>hspell-i</b> also enables the
      <b>-i</b> option. This is a useful trick when an application expects just
      the name of a spell-checking program, and adds only the &quot;-a&quot;
      option (without giving the user an option to also add &quot;-i&quot;). The
      <b>multispell</b> script supplied with <b>hspell</b> serves a similar
      purpose, with more control over encodings and which spell-checker to run
      for non-Hebrew words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-H</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, Hspell does not allow the He Ha-sh'ela prefix.
      This is because this prefix is not normally used in modern Hebrew, and
      generates many false-negatives (errors, like He followed by a possessed
      noun, are thought to be correct). The <b>-H</b> option nevertheless tells
      Hspell to allow this prefix.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D base</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Load the word lists from the given base pathname, rather
      than from the compiled-in default path. This is mostly used for testing
      Hspell, when the dictionaries have been compiled in the current directory
      and hspell is run as &quot;hspell -Dhebrew.wgz&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d, -B, -m, -T, -C, -S, -P, -p, -w, and -W</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These options are passed to <b>hspell</b> by <b>lyx</b> or
      other applications, thinking they are talking to ispell. These options are
      cordially ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SPELLING_STANDARD"><a class="selflink" href="#SPELLING_STANDARD">SPELLING
  STANDARD</a></h1>
Hspell was designed to be 100% and strictly compliant with the official
  niqqud-less spelling rules (&quot;Ha-ktiv Khasar Ha-niqqud&quot;, colloquially
  known as &quot;Ktiv Male&quot;) published by the Academy of the Hebrew
  Language.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is both an advantage and a disadvantage, depending on your viewpoint. It's
  an advantage because it encourages a <b>correct</b> and consistent spelling
  style throughout your writing. It is a disadvantage, because a few of the
  Academia's official spelling decisions are relatively unknown to the general
  public.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Users of Hspell (and all Hebrew writers, for that matter) are encouraged to read
  the Academia's official niqqud-less spelling rules (which are printed at the
  end of most modern Hebrew dictionaries, and an abridged version is available
  in http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision4.html). Users are also encouraged
  to refer to Hebrew dictionaries which use the niqqud-less spelling (such as
  Millon Ha-hove, Rav Milim, and the new Even Shoshan).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hspell's distribution (and Web site) also include a document,
  <b>niqqudless.odt</b>, which explains Hspell's spelling standard in detail (in
  Hebrew). It explains both the overall principles, and why specific words are
  spelled the way they are.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A future release may include an option for alternative spelling standards.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BEHIND_THE_SCENES"><a class="selflink" href="#BEHIND_THE_SCENES">BEHIND
  THE SCENES</a></h1>
The <b>hspell</b> program itself is mostly a simple (but efficient) program that
  checks input words against a long list of valid words. The real
  &quot;brains&quot; behind it are the word lists (dictionary) provided by the
  Hspell project.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order for this dictionary to be completely free of other people's copyright
  restrictions, the Hspell project is a clean-room implementation, not based on
  pre-existing word lists or spell checkers, or on copying of printed
  dictionaries.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The word list is also not based on automatic scanning of available Hebrew
  documents (such as online newspapers), because there is no way to guarantee
  that such a list will be correct, complete, or consistent in its spelling
  standard.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Instead, our idea was to write programs which know how to correctly inflect
  Hebrew nouns and conjugate Hebrew verbs. The input to these programs is a list
  of noun stems and verb roots, plus hints needed for the correct inflection
  when these cannot be figured out automatically. Most of the effort that went
  into the Hspell project went into building these input files. Then, &quot;word
  list generators&quot; (written in Perl, and are also part of the Hspell
  project) create the complete inflected word list that will be used by the
  spellchecking program, hspell. This generation process is only done once, when
  building <b>hspell</b> from source.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These lists, before and after inflection, may be useful for much more than
  spellchecking. Morphological analysis (which <b>hspell</b> provides with the
  <b>-l</b> option) is one example. For more ideas, see Hspell project's Web
  site, at <b>http://ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker</b>.

Although we wrote all of Hspell's code ourselves, we are truly indebted to the
  old-style &quot;open source&quot; pioneers - people who wrote books instead of
  hiding their knowledge in proprietary software. For the correct noun
  inflections, Dr. Shaul Barkali's &quot;The Complete Noun Book&quot; has been a
  great help. Prof. Uzzi Ornan's booklet &quot;Verb Conjugation in Flow
  Charts&quot; has been instrumental in the implementation of verb conjugation,
  and Barkali's &quot;The Complete Verb Book&quot; was used too.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
During our work we have extensively used a number of Hebrew dictionaries,
  including Even Shoshan, Millon Ha-hove and Rav-Milim, to ensure the
  correctness of certain words. Various Hebrew newspapers and books, both
  printed and online, were used for inspiration and for finding words we still
  do not recognize.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
We wish to thank Cilla Tuviana and Dr. Zvi Har'El for their assistance with some
  grammatical questions.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Several other people helped us in various releases, with suggestions, fixes or
  patches - they are listed in the WHATSNEW file in the distribution.

For GUI-lovers, <b>hspell</b>'s user interface is an abomination. However, as
  more and more applications learn to interface with <b>hspell</b>, and as
  Hspell's data becomes available in multi-lingual spellcheckers (such as aspell
  and hunspell), this will no longer be an issue. See
  <b>http://hspell.ivrix.org.il/</b> for instructions on how to use Hspell in a
  variety of applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>hspell</b>'s being limited to the ISO-8859-8 encoding, and not recognizing
