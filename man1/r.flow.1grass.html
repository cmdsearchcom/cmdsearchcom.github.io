<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.flow generates flowlines using a combined raster-vector
approach (see Mitasova and Hofierka 1993 and Mitasova et al.
1995) from an input elevation raster map (integer or
float&acirc; <br>
ing point), and optionally an input aspect raster map and/or
an input barrier raster map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three possible output
raster maps which can be produced in any combination
simultaneously: a vector map flowline of flowlines, a raster
map flowlength of flowpath <br>
lengths, and a raster map flowaccumulation of flowline
densities (which are equal upslope contributed areas per
unit width, when multiplied by resolution).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Aspect used for input must follow the same rules as aspect
computed in other modules (see v.surf.rst or
r.slope.aspect).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output flowline is generated
downhill. The line segments of flowline vectors have
endpoints on edges of a grid formed by drawing imaginary
lines through the centers of the cells <br>
in the elevation map. Flowlines are generated from each cell
downhill by default; they can be generated uphill using the
flag -u. A flowline stops if its next segment would <br>
reverse the direction of flow (from up to down or
vice-versa), cross a barrier, or arrive at a cell with
undefined elevation or aspect. Another option, skip,
indicates that only <br>
the flowlines from every val-th cell are to be included in
flowline. The default skip is max(1, &lt;rows in
elevation&gt;/50, &lt;cols in elevation&gt;/50). A high skip
usually speeds up <br>
processing time and often improves the readability of a
visualization of flowline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flowpath length output is given
in a raster map flowlength. The value in each grid cell is
the sum of the planar lengths of all segments of the
flowline generated from that cell. <br>
If the flag -3 is given, elevation is taken into account in
calculating the length of each segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flowline density downhill or
uphill output is given in a raster map flowaccumulation. The
value in each grid cell is the number of flowlines which
pass through that grid cell, <br>
that means the number of flowlines from thec entire map
which have segment endpoints within that cell. With the -m
flag less memory is used as aspect at each cell is computed
on <br>
the fly. This option incurs a severe performance penalty. If
this flag is given, the aspect input map (if any) will be
ignored. The barrier parameter is a raster map name with
<br>
non-zero values representing barriers as input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, use input
elevation maps with high precision units (e.g., centimeters)
so that flowlines do not terminate prematurely in flat
areas. To prevent the creation of <br>
tiny flowline segments with imperceivable changes in
elevation, an endpoint which would land very close to the
center of a grid cell is quantized to the exact center of
that <br>
cell. The maximum distance between the intercepts along each
axis of a single diagonal segment and another segment of 1/2
degree different aspect is taken to be &quot;very
close&quot; for <br>
that axis. Note that this distance (the so-called
&quot;quantization error&quot;) is about 1-2% of the
resolution on maps with square cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values in length maps
computed using the -u flag represent the distances from each
cell to an upland flat or singular point. Such distances are
useful in water erosion model&acirc; <br>
ing for computation of the LS factor in the standard form of
USLE. Uphill flowlines merge on ridge lines; by redirecting
the order of the flowline points in the output vector <br>
map, dispersed waterflow can be simulated. The density map
can be used for the extraction of ridge lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Computing the flowlines downhill
simulates the actual flow (also known as the raindrop
method). These flowlines tend to merge in valleys; they can
be used for localization of <br>
areas with waterflow accumulation and for the extraction of
channels. The downslope flowline density multiplied by the
resolution can be used as an approximation of the upslope
<br>
contributing area per unit contour width. This area is a
measure of potential water flux for the steady state
conditions and can be used in the modeling of water erosion
for the <br>
computation of the unit stream power based LS factor or
sediment transport capacity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.flow has been designed for
modeling erosion on hillslopes and has rather strict
conditions for ending flowlines. It is therefore not very
suitable for the extraction of stream <br>
networks or delineation of watersheds unless a DEM without
pits or flat areas is available (r.fill.dir can be used to
fill pits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To label the vector flowlines
automatically, the user can use v.category (add
categories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm background <br>
r.flow uses an original vector-grid algorithm which uses an
infinite number of directions between 0.0000... and
360.0000... and traces the flow as a line (vector) in the
direc&acirc; <br>
tion of gradient (rather than from cell to cell in one of
the 8 directions = D-infinity algorithm). They are traced in
any direction using aspect (so there is no limitation to 8
<br>
directions here). The D8 algorithm produces zig-zag lines.
The value in the outlet is very similar for r.flow algorithm
(because it is essentially the watershed area), however <br>
the spatial distribution of flow, especially on hillslopes
is quite different. It is still a 1D flow routing so the
dispersal flow is not accurately described, but still better
<br>
than D8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.flow uses a single flow
algorithm, i.e. all flow is transported to a single cell
downslope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics <br>
Elevation raster map resolution differs from current region
resolution <br>
The resolutions of all input raster maps and the current
region must match (see g.region). <br>
Resolution too unbalanced <br>
The difference in length between the two axes of a grid cell
is so great that quantization error is larger than one of
the dimensions. Resample the map and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
In this example a flow line vector map, a flow path length
raster map and a flow accumulation raster map are computed
from an elevation raster map (North Carolina sample <br>
dataset): <br>
g.region raster=elevation -p <br>
r.flow elevation=elevation skip=3 flowline=flowline
flowlength=flowlength flowaccumulation=flowaccumulation</p>
