<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hist2workspace - utility to create RooFit/RooStats workspace
from histograms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hist2workspace [option] input.xml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hist2workspace is a utility to create RooFit/RooStats
workspace from histograms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-standard_form default model, which creates an extended PDF
that interpolates between RooHistFuncs. This is much faster
for models with many bins and uses significantly less <br>
memory. <br>
-number_counting_form this was the original model in 5.28
(without patches). It uses a Poisson for each bin of the
histogram. This can become slow and memory intensive when
<br>
there are many bins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prepare working area <br>
The ROOT release ships with a script prepareHistFactory in
the $ROOTSYS/bin directory that prepares a working area. It
creates a results/, data/, and config/ directory. It also
<br>
copies the HistFactorySchema.dtd and example XML files into
the config/ directory. Additionally, it copies a root file
into the data/ directory for use with the examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HistFactorySchema.dtd <br>
This file is located in $ROOTSYS/etc/ specifies the XML
schema. It is typically placed in the config/ directory of a
working area together with the top-level XML file and the
<br>
individual channel XML files. The user should not modify
this file. <br>
The HistFactorySchema.dtd is commented to specify exactly
the meaning of the various options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Top-Level XML File <br>
(see for example $ROOTSYS/tutorials/histfactory/example.xml)
This file is edited by the user. It specifies <br>
- A top level &rsquo;Combination&rsquo; that is composed of:
<br>
- several &rsquo;Channels&rsquo;, which are described in
separate XML files. <br>
- several &rsquo;Measurements&rsquo; (corresponding to a
full fit of the model) each of which specifies <br>
- a name for this measurement to be used in tables and files
<br>
- what is the luminosity associated to the measurement in
picobarns <br>
- which bins of the histogram should be used <br>
- what is the relative uncertainty on the luminosity <br>
- what is (are) the parameter(s) of interest that will be
measured <br>
- which parameters should be fixed/floating (eg. nuisance
parameters) <br>
- which type of constriants are desired <br>
- Gaussian by default <br>
- Gamma, LogNormal, and Uniform are also supported <br>
- if the tool should export the model only and skip the
default fit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Channel XML Files <br>
(see for example
$ROOTSYS/tutorials/histfactory/example_channel.xml) This
file is edited by the user. It specifies for each channel
<br>
- observed data <br>
- if absent the tool will use the expectation, which is
useful for expected sensitivity <br>
- several &rsquo;Samples&rsquo; (eg. signal, bkg1, bkg2,
...), each of which has: <br>
- a name <br>
- if the sample is normalized by theory (eg N = L*sigma) or
not (eg. data driven) <br>
- a nominal expectation histogram <br>
- a named &rsquo;Normalization Factor&rsquo; (which can be
fixed or allowed to float in a fit) <br>
- several &rsquo;Overall Systematics&rsquo; in normalization
with: <br>
- a name <br>
- +/- 1 sigma variations (eg. 1.05 and 0.95 for a 5%
uncertainty) <br>
- several &rsquo;Histogram Systematics&rsquo; in shape with:
<br>
- a name (which can be shared with the OverallSyst if
correlated) <br>
- +/- 1 sigma variational histograms</p>
