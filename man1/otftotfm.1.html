<p>OTFTOTFM(1) General Commands Manual OTFTOTFM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
otftotfm - create TeX font metrics from OpenType fonts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
otftotfm [-a] [options] fontfile [texname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Otftotfm creates the font metric and encoding files required
to use an OpenType font with TeX. You supply an OpenType
&quot;.otf&quot; or &quot;.ttf&quot; font file, a base
&quot;.enc&quot; encoding, and a <br>
TeX name &quot;texname&quot; for the resulting font, and say
which OpenType features should be turned on. Then otftotfm
generates and installs the corresponding TeX-related metric
files <br>
(&quot;.tfm&quot; TeX font metrics, &quot;.vf&quot; virtual
fonts, and &quot;.enc&quot; encoding files). It works on
both PostScript-flavored and TrueType-flavored OpenType
fonts, although TrueType-flavor <br>
support will only work easily with pdftex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest way to use otftotfm
is with the -a option; see Automatic Mode below. Without -a,
otftotfm writes all its output files to the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running &quot;otftotfm
fontfile texname&quot; and installing the results (manually
or with -a), you can use the OpenType font in plain TeX with
a command like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntfont=texname at 10pt <br>
{font This text uses the OpenType font.}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LaTeX users will generally make
a &quot;.fd&quot; input file so that
mdefault}{TeXName}&quot; work correctly. enewcommand{
commands like &quot; See the EXAMPLE section for more; check
the DIAG&acirc; <br>
NOSTICS and FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS sections if you have
trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenType Features <br>
OpenType fonts support optional features that change their
appearance. Use the -f option to turn on selected features.
For example, &quot;-fsmcp&quot; replaces lower-case letters
with <br>
the corresponding small capitals, in fonts that support
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll generally provide
at least the &quot;-fkern&quot; and &quot;-fliga&quot;
options, which activate pair kerns and f-ligatures. Other
interesting features include &quot;-fcpsp&quot;, for capital
spacing; <br>
&quot;-fdlig&quot;, for optional ligatures;
&quot;-flnum&quot;, &quot;-fonum&quot;, &quot;-fpnum&quot;,
and &quot;-ftnum&quot;, to control digit glyphs;
&quot;-fsmcp&quot;, for small capitals; &quot;-fswsh&quot;,
for swash variants; and &quot;-fcswh&quot;, <br>
for contextual swash. See the FEATURE DIRECTORY section
below for more. The otfinfo(1) program will report which
features a font supports; run &quot;otfinfo -f
fontfile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature options can also apply a
feature to a subset of characters in the font. For example,
&quot;--lf smcp&quot; only replaces letters with small
capitals, whereas &quot;-fsmcp&quot; might addi&acirc; <br>
tionally replace digits and punctuation marks with
small-capital versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Mode <br>
Automatic mode, triggered by the -a/--automatic option,
installs font metrics and encoding files where TeX can find
them, and additionally installs a Type 1 font and mapping
for <br>
dvips(1). This requires a TeX installation that follows the
TeX Directory Structure standard (http://www.tug.org/tds/),
such as most Unix TeX installations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic mode should run
seamlessly out of the box. Otftotfm will install metrics
files, encodings, map files, and Type 1 fonts into
$HOME/.texmf-var or any other writable <br>
TEXMF directory, and run updmap(1) to update the global
lists of installed fonts. (On older teTeX installations, you
may first need to copy the system&rsquo;s updmap.cfg file to
<br>
$HOME/texmf/web2c and run mktexlsr(1). On newer TeXLive
installations, you may need to set the TEXMFVAR environment
variable.) You can then run &quot;otftotfm -a fontfile
texname&quot; <br>
and immediately refer to the font in TeX using the texname
you supplied. Again, you will have to write &quot;.fd&quot;
files and/or typescripts to make the font conveniently
accessible <br>
from LaTeX or ConTeXt. See the DIAGNOSTICS section if you
have problems with these instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In automatic mode, otftotfm
searches your $TEXMFVAR or $TEXMF path for a writable
directory, then installs files under that directory tree as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File type Directory Filename
<br>
TFM TEXMF/fonts/tfm/vendor/typeface/ texname[--base].tfm
<br>
VF TEXMF/fonts/vf/vendor/typeface/ texname.vf <br>
PL TEXMF/fonts/pl/vendor/typeface/ texname[--base].pl <br>
VPL TEXMF/fonts/vpl/vendor/typeface/ texname.vpl <br>
encoding TEXMF/fonts/enc/dvips/vendor/ a_signature.enc <br>
or TEXMF/dvips/vendor/ <br>
font map TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/vendor/ vendor.map <br>
or TEXMF/dvips/vendor/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TEXMF&quot; stands for the
writable TEXMF directory. Texname is the font name supplied
as otftotfm&rsquo;s second argument. The vendor and typeface
strings are required by TDS; they <br>
default to &quot;lcdftools&quot; and the font&rsquo;s family
name, respectively, but see the --vendor and --typeface
options. Signature is an opaque 6-character encoding
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otftotfm also installs a font
file suitable for printing. PostScript-flavored OpenType
fonts are translated to Type 1 format and installed as PFB
fonts. TrueType-flavored fonts <br>
are normally installed as is, since pdftex and pdflatex can
read TrueType directly; but if you provide the --type42
option, otftotfm will translate TrueType fonts to Type 42
for&acirc; <br>
mat, which dvips understands. Otftotfm does not overwrite
existing font files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The installation paths are as
follows, where PSname is the font&rsquo;s PostScript
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PFB
TEXMF/fonts/type1/vendor/typeface/ PSname.pfb <br>
TrueType TEXMF/fonts/truetype/vendor/typeface/ fontfile <br>
Type 42 TEXMF/fonts/type42/vendor/typeface/ PSname.t42</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can override these
directories with environment variables and options as
follows. Options take precedence over environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File type Environment variable
Option <br>
TFM TFMDESTDIR --tfm-directory <br>
VF VFDESTDIR --vf-directory <br>
PL PLDESTDIR --pl-directory <br>
VPL VPLDESTDIR --vpl-directory <br>
encoding ENCODINGDESTDIR --encoding-directory <br>
PFB T1DESTDIR --type1-directory <br>
TrueType TRUETYPEDESTDIR --truetype-directory <br>
Type 42 T42DESTDIR --type42-directory <br>
font map - --map-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otftotfm will update the
TEXMF/ls-R file when installing files under TEXMF. It will
also run the updmap(1) program after changing a map file,
unless the --no-updmap option was <br>
supplied. However, if an executable file called
TEXMF/dvips/updmap exists, this file is executed (from the
TEXMF/dvips directory) rather than the global updmap. This
is so you <br>
can write a fast, customized version of updmap if
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
This section uses MinionPro to show one way to install
OpenType fonts for LaTeX. We begin with six fonts:
&quot;MinionPro-Regular.otf&quot;,
&quot;MinionPro-It.otf&quot;,
&quot;MinionPro-Semibold.otf&quot;, <br>
&quot;MinionPro-SemiboldIt.otf&quot;,
&quot;MinionPro-Bold.otf&quot;, and
&quot;MinionPro-BoldIt.otf&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Our first task is to decide how
to encode the fonts. The &quot;encoding scheme&quot; is used
by TeX to decide how to typeset accents and symbols like
&quot;$&quot;. The &quot;LY1&quot; encoding scheme has <br>
reasonable accent support and is a good choice for many
OpenType fonts. LY1 corresponds to the
&quot;texnansx.enc&quot; encoding file, so we will supply
otftotfm with the &quot;-e texnansx&quot; <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expert note: Strictly speaking,
LY1 corresponds to the &quot;texnansi.enc&quot; encoding
file. Since the &quot;texnansx.enc&quot; version omits
duplicate characters, it has more room for <br>
font-specific glyphs and is generally a better choice; but
if you plan to type characters like &quot;ae&quot; directly
into your editor, rather than using TeX commands like e, you
<br>
should use &quot;texnansi.enc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, we decide on a naming
scheme for the font metric files. Let&rsquo;s use the
OpenType font names as a base. (There&rsquo;s generally no
need to follow the six-character &quot;Karl Berry&quot; <br>
naming scheme.) Just in case we come back later and add a
different encoding scheme, we&rsquo;ll prepend
&quot;LY1--&quot; to each name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;re now ready to run
otftotfm for the first set of fonts. Note the &quot;-fkern
-fliga&quot; options, which access pair kerns and the
default &quot;f&quot; ligatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otftotfm -a -e texnansx
MinionPro-Regular.otf -fkern -fliga LY1--MinionPro-Regular
<br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-It.otf -fkern -fliga
LY1--MinionPro-It <br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-Semibold.otf -fkern -fliga
LY1--MinionPro-Semibold <br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-SemiboldIt.otf -fkern
-fliga LY1--MinionPro-SemiboldIt <br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-Bold.otf -fkern -fliga
LY1--MinionPro-Bold <br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-BoldIt.otf -fkern -fliga
LY1--MinionPro-BoldIt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The small-caps fonts are
generated with an additional &quot;-fsmcp&quot; option. We
append &quot;--fsmcp&quot; to the font metric names as well,
differentiating them from the regular fonts. <br>
Although MinionPro&rsquo;s italic fonts support small-caps,
the LaTeX font selection scheme can&rsquo;t access them
easily, so we&rsquo;ve left them off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otftotfm -a -e texnansx
MinionPro-Regular.otf -fkern -fliga -fsmcp
LY1--MinionPro-Regular--fsmcp <br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-Semibold.otf -fkern -fliga
-fsmcp LY1--MinionPro-Semibold--fsmcp <br>
otftotfm -a -e texnansx MinionPro-Bold.otf -fkern -fliga
-fsmcp LY1--MinionPro-Bold--fsmcp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get old-style numerals, just
add the &quot;-fonum&quot; option to each invocation -- and,
to reduce confusion, append &quot;--fonum&quot; to the font
metric names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, all our font
metric files are installed, and it&rsquo;s finally time to
create the &quot;.fd&quot; file. (The &quot;.fd&quot; format
is documented in The LaTeX Companion.) Let&rsquo;s call the
<br>
LaTeX font family &quot;MinionPro&quot;. Then the
&quot;.fd&quot; file is &quot;LY1MinionPro.fd&quot;, and it
contains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FontFamily{LY1}{MinionPro}{}
<br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{m}{n}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Regular }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{m}{it}{ &lt;-&gt;
LY1--MinionPro-It }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{m}{sc}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Regular--fsmcp }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{sb}{n}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Semibold }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{sb}{it}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-SemiboldIt }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{sb}{sc}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Semibold--fsmcp }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{b}{n}{ &lt;-&gt;

FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{b}{it}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-BoldIt }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{b}{sc}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; LY1--MinionPro-Bold--fsmcp }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{bx}{n}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; ssub * MinionPro/b/n }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{bx}{it}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; ssub * MinionPro/b/it }{} <br>
FontShape{LY1}{MinionPro}{bx}{sc}% <br>
{ &lt;-&gt; ssub * MinionPro/b/sc }{}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;re now ready to use
MinionPro in LaTeX, with lines like this in the document
preamble:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sepackage[LY1]{fontenc}
mdefault}{MinionPro} <br>
enewcommand{d <br>
enewcommand{eault}{b}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, we&rsquo;re free at
any time to add more MinionPro variants with otftotfm;
they&rsquo;ll become accessible to LaTeX as soon as we edit
the &quot;MinionPro.fd&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
With long options, you need type only as many characters as
will make the option unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font Feature and Transformation
Options <br>
-s script[.lang], --script=script[.lang] <br>
Apply features suitable to the script system script and
language system lang. Scripts and language systems are
two-to-four-letter names assigned by Microsoft and Adobe.
<br>
Examples include &quot;latn&quot; (Latin script),
&quot;grek&quot; (Greek script), and &quot;yi.YIC&quot; (Yi
script with classic characters). If lang is not specified,
otftotfm will use the default <br>
language system for that script. You can give this option
multiple times. Run &quot;otfinfo -s font&quot; to see the
list of scripts and languages a font supports. Defaults to
<br>
&quot;latn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f feature, --feature=feature
<br>
Activate the feature named feature. Features are four-letter
names assigned by Microsoft and Adobe; they are meant to
correspond to font behaviors, such as kerning or <br>
small-capitals. Examples include &quot;liga&quot; (default
ligatures), &quot;dlig&quot; (discretionary ligatures),
&quot;kern&quot; (kerning), and &quot;c2sc&quot; (replacing
capitals with small capitals). Give <br>
this option multiple times to apply multiple features. Run
&quot;otfinfo -f [--script option] font&quot; to see the
list of features a font supports for a specified script.
Defaults <br>
to any features required by the selected scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lf feature,
--letter-feature=feature <br>
Activate the feature named feature, but only for letters.
For instance, the &quot;-f smcp&quot; option will apply the
small-caps feature to all characters in the encoding; this
may <br>
result in changes to punctuation and numbers as well as
letters. The &quot;--lf smcp&quot; option will apply the
small-caps feature only to letters, meaning characters with
the &quot;Let&acirc; <br>
ter&quot; Unicode property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--subs-filter pattern <br>
--include-subs pattern <br>
--exclude-subs pattern <br>
--clear-subs <br>
Limit the characters that otftotfm will substitute.
Substitution is allowed on an input character if it matches
at least one of the --include patterns, and none of the <br>
--exclude patterns. Each pattern applies to all following
features, except that the --clear option clears any
accumulated patterns. The --subs-filter pattern option acts
<br>
like --clear-subs followed by --include-subs pattern. For
pattern syntax, see GLYPH PATTERNS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the command line below, the
&rsquo;&lt;Number&gt;&rsquo; pattern will force the
&quot;onum&quot; feature to substitute only numbers (and
not, for example, punctuation). The &quot;salt&quot; feature
can still <br>
substitute any character. <br>
otftotfm -fsalt --include-subs=&quot;&lt;Number&gt;&quot;
-fonum ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E fac, --extend=fac <br>
Widen, or extend, the font by a factor of fac. Like
afm2tfm(1)&rsquo;s -e option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S amt, --slant=amt <br>
Oblique, or slant, the font by amt. Like afm2tfm(1)&rsquo;s
-s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L amt, --letterspacing=amt <br>
Letterspace each character by amt units, where 1000 units
equals one em. The width of each character increases by amt,
with half the space distributed to each sidebearing. <br>
Boundary-character kerns are added to maintain alignment at
the ends of lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--math-spacing[=skewchar] <br>
Ignore the font&rsquo;s claimed character widths, deriving
horizontal metrics from bounding boxes instead. This results
in similar spacing as the Computer Modern Math Italic <br>
font, with increased sidebearings for letters like f and
j.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you provide skewchar, a
number between 0 and 255 or a single character, then
otftotfm adds heuristically-derived kerns to the font that
may improve accent positions in <br>
math mode. To get the benefits, you must tell TeX about the
skewchar with a command like
&quot;wcharnt=skewchar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k N, --min-kern=N <br>
Only output kerning pairs whose absolute value is N or
larger. Larger minimum kerns make kerning less precise, but
shrink the output TFM file. The default minimum kern is <br>
2.0, or 0.002 em.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--space-factor=fac <br>
Scale the width of the inter-word space by a factor of
fac.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--design-size=size <br>
Set the output font&rsquo;s design size to size, a value in
TeX points. This value is mostly just documentation, since
LaTeX essentially ignores fonts&rsquo; design sizes, but
plain <br>
TeX may occasionally use the design size to decide how large
a font should be. (Loading a font in TeX &quot;at&quot; a
particular size effectively ignores the design size; loading
a <br>
font plain or &quot;scaled&quot; by a given factor uses the
design size.) The default is taken from the input
font&rsquo;s optical size feature, or 10pt if it has no such
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fixed-width <br>
Set the font to fixed-width (its space character will have
no stretch or shrink). Normally you won&rsquo;t need this
option; the font will tell otftotfm whether it is fixed <br>
width. The opposite of --fixed-width is
--proportional-width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--italic-angle=angle <br>
Set the output font&rsquo;s default italic angle to angle, a
number of degrees. This value is used by TeX to position
accents. Normally you won&rsquo;t need this option; the font
will <br>
tell otftotfm its italic angle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--x-height=val <br>
Set the output font&rsquo;s x-height to val. This value is
used by TeX to position accents. Normally you won&rsquo;t
need this option. Val may be a number expressed in font
units; <br>
&acirc;x&acirc;, which uses the height of the font&rsquo;s
lowercase x; or &acirc;font&acirc;, which uses the
font&rsquo;s declared x-height metric.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding Options <br>
-e encoding, --encoding=encoding <br>
Select the output metrics&rsquo;s base dvips(1) encoding.
Otftotfm will search for encoding[.enc] the same way that
dvips would, so you may not need to give a full pathname.
Say <br>
-e - to start with the font&rsquo;s default encoding. See
ENCODINGS, below, for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--boundary-char=char <br>
Set the font&rsquo;s boundary character to char, which
should either be a single non-digit character, or a number
between -1 and 255. The default is taken from the
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--altselector-char=char <br>
Set the font&rsquo;s alternate selector character to char,
which should either be a single non-digit character, or a
number between -1 and 255. Alternate selectors let TeX <br>
authors explicitly choose between versions of a character.
For instance, the
&rsquo;--altselector-char=&quot;*&quot;&rsquo; option turns
the &quot;*&quot; character into a special switch that
cycles <br>
between alternates. For instance, the TeX input
&quot;A&quot; would produce the normal version of the
&quot;A&quot; Unicode character, &quot;A*&quot; would
produce the first alternate, &quot;A**&quot; would
pro&acirc; <br>
duce the second alternate, and so forth. Furthermore,
&quot;s*t&quot; will activate any discretionary
&quot;s_t&quot; ligature in the font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --altselector-char mechanism
uses the features specified by --altselector-feature
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternate-selector character
may also be specified in the encoding; see ENCODINGS, below.
See Sivan Toledo&rsquo;s article cited in the SEE ALSO
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--altselector-feature=feature
<br>
Activate the feature named feature for the
--altselector-char mechanism. Give this option multiple
times to activate multiple features. This option activates
features only <br>
for use with --altselector-char; use the --feature option to
activate features globally. Defaults to the salt and dlig
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alternates-filter=pattern <br>
--include-alternates=pattern <br>
--exclude-alternates=pattern <br>
--clear-alternates <br>
Limit the alternate characters that otftotfm will select. An
alternate is used if it matches at least one of the
--include patterns, and none of the --exclude patterns. <br>
Each pattern applies to all following features, except that
the --clear option clears any accumulated patterns. The
--alternates-filter pattern option acts like <br>
--clear-alternates followed by --include-alternates pattern.
For pattern syntax, see GLYPH PATTERNS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenType fonts can have many
alternates per character, most of which aren&rsquo;t
interesting. For example, the character &quot;a&quot; in
WarnockPro-Regular has five alternates, &quot;ordfemi&acirc;
<br>
nine&quot;, &quot;Asmall&quot;, &quot;asuperior&quot;,
&quot;a.end&quot;, and &quot;orn.013&quot;. The
--altselector-char option lets you cycle through these
alternates, but it&rsquo;s better to leave out the ones you
don&rsquo;t <br>
want, to avoid overfull encodings. Thus, if you were only
interested in &quot;.end&quot; variants, you might supply an
&rsquo;--include-alternates=&quot;*.end&quot;&rsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the command line below, the
&rsquo;*.end&rsquo; pattern will apply to &quot;aalt&quot;
alternates, but not to &quot;salt&quot; alternates. <br>
otftotfm -fsalt --include-alternates=&quot;*.end&quot;
-faalt ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ligkern=command <br>
Add a LIGKERN command to the encoding. For example,
&rsquo;--ligkern &quot;T {L} h&quot;&rsquo; suppresses any
T_h ligature in the font. You can supply multiple --ligkern
options. See ENCOD&acirc; <br>
INGS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--position=command <br>
Add a POSITION command to the encoding. For example,
&rsquo;--position &quot;T 10 0 20&quot;&rsquo; adds ten
units of space to either side of the &quot;T&quot;
character. You can supply multiple --posi&acirc; <br>
tion options. See ENCODINGS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unicoding=command <br>
Add a UNICODING command to the encoding. For example,
&rsquo;--unicoding &quot;pi1 =: uni03D6&quot;&rsquo; tells
otftotfm to encode &quot;/pi1&quot; as U+03D6 GREEK PI
SYMBOL. You can supply multiple <br>
--unicoding options. See ENCODINGS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-encoding-commands <br>
Ignore any LIGKERN and/or UNICODING commands in the encoding
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-default-ligkern <br>
Don&rsquo;t include otftotfm&rsquo;s default LIGKERN
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--coding-scheme=scheme <br>
Add a CODINGSCHEME to the encoding. See ENCODINGS,
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-missing <br>
Warn about encoded characters not supported by the font. See
the WARNMISSING command in ENCODINGS, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--literal-encoding=encoding <br>
Select the dvips(1) encoding used for the font. No glyph
substitutions will be permitted, so the output encoding will
equal the input encoding (and otftotfm will not gener&acirc;
<br>
ate an output encoding).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--base-encodings=file <br>
Experts only. Allow the output font to refer to existing
&quot;base&quot; fonts. This can greatly reduce the number
of base fonts generated by otftotfm. Each line in the file
argu&acirc; <br>
ment contains a TeX font name (as for --name) and a
corresponding literal encoding file (as for
--literal-encoding); for example: <br>
WarnoProReg--eka eka <br>
WarnoProReg--exp1 exp1 <br>
The named fonts must have been created by prior runs of
otftotfm on the same input OpenType font, with the same
--extend and --slant options as the current run. The current
<br>
output font will refer to glyphs from the named base fonts
when possible. If the base fonts cover all glyphs required
by the output font, otftotfm won&rsquo;t generate any new
<br>
base fonts at all. The file can also refer to dotless-J
fonts using the following syntax: <br>
WarnoProReg--lcdfj - dotlessj</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Mode Options <br>
-a, --automatic <br>
Select automatic mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v vendor, --vendor=vendor <br>
Set the font vendor name, which is used to locate files
within the TDS. Defaults to &quot;lcdftools&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In automatic mode, TeX and
friends will generally find required font files
independently of the vendor you select.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--typeface=typeface <br>
Set the font typeface name, which is used to locate files
within the TDS. Defaults to the current font&rsquo;s family
name with unsuiable characters removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-type1 <br>
Do not use cfftot1(1) to create Type 1 fonts corresponding
to the OpenType input fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-dotlessj <br>
Do not use t1dotlessj(1) to create a special dotless-j font
when the input font doesn&rsquo;t have dotless-j.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-truetype <br>
Do not install TrueType-flavored fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--type42 <br>
Install TrueType-flavored fonts in translated Type 42
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-updmap <br>
Do not run an updmap(1) program. This can be useful if
you&rsquo;re installing a bunch of fonts; it is much faster
to run updmap once, at the end, than to run it once per
font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Options <br>
-n texname, --name=texname <br>
Set the TeX name of the output font, which is used in font
map files and, in automatic mode, to generate the output
filename. The default is derived from the OpenType <br>
font&rsquo;s name and the features you selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pl <br>
Output human-readable PL and VPL metrics, not binary TFM and
VF metrics. Note: Otftotfm&rsquo;s PL and VPL output files
are legal, but the fontinst program may not accept them <br>
(it has a picky parser). Make sure to supply a
--coding-scheme; if that doesn&rsquo;t help, run the TFM
output through tftopl(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-virtual <br>
Do not generate virtual fonts (VFs and VPLs). Otftotfm will
warn if the selected font features cannot be implemented
without virtual fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-encoding <br>
Do not generate an encoding file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-encoding[=file] <br>
Only generate an encoding file; do not generate any other
output. The encoding file is written to file, or to standard
output if no file argument is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-map <br>
Do not generate a font map line for the font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Location Options <br>
--tfm-directory=dir <br>
--pl-directory=dir <br>
--vf-directory=dir <br>
--vpl-directory=dir <br>
--encoding-directory=dir <br>
--type1-directory=dir <br>
--truetype-directory=dir <br>
--type42-directory=dir <br>
Set the directory used for various output types. Each
directory may be set by an environment variable, and
defaults to a TDS directory in automatic mode, or to
&quot;.&quot; other&acirc; <br>
wise. Environment variable names and default TDS locations
are described in the Automatic Mode section above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--map-file=filename <br>
Set file in which otftotfm will write a font map line for
the font. The default is the standard output in manual mode,
and &quot;TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/vendor/vendor.map&quot; (or
<br>
&quot;TEXMF/dvips/vendor/vendor.map&quot; on older
installations) in automatic mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous Options <br>
--glyphlist=file <br>
Use file as a Adobe glyph list, which helps translate glyph
names to Unicode code points. Give multiple options to
include multiple files. See ENCODINGS, below, for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Write progress messages to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-create <br>
Do not create or modify any files. Instead, write messages
about the program&rsquo;s hypothetical progress to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
Generate all files, even if it looks like versions are
already installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Do not generate any error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kpathsea-debug=flags <br>
Set path searching debugging flags. See the Kpathsea manual
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number and some short non-warranty
information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCODINGS <br>
Otftotfm interprets encoding files as Unicode. For example,
say an input encoding has &quot;/dotlessi&quot; at position
10. Otftotfm detects that position 10 should contain Unicode
char&acirc; <br>
acter U+0131 LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I, and uses the
font&rsquo;s glyph for that character (possibly modified by
any active features). The selected glyph might not be named
&quot;dot&acirc; <br>
lessi&quot;; only the Unicode value matters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otftotfm assigns Unicode values
to glyph names using a table published by Adobe (SEE ALSO
has a reference), with extensions for TeX. For more
fine-grained control, add UNICODING <br>
commands to the input encoding file. These commands have the
following format: <br>
% UNICODING glyph =: choice1 [choice2 ...] ; <br>
This tells otftotfm that the glyph named glyph translates
into the first Unicode value in the choice list that has a
character in the font. Glyph and the choices are PostScript
<br>
glyph names; the initial &quot;%&quot; sign is required; and
each UNICODING line can contain multiple commands, separated
by spaced semicolons. For example, <br>
% UNICODING pi1 =: uni03D6 ; <br>
encodes the character &quot;/pi1&quot; as U+03D6 GREEK PI
SYMBOL, and <br>
% UNICODING Delta =: uni0394 uni2206 ; <br>
makes U+0394 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA preferred to U+2206
INCREMENT as an encoding for &quot;/Delta&quot;. You can
also supply glyph names: <br>
% UNICODING Delta =: Deltagreek Delta ; <br>
A mapping with no Unicode values removes that glyph from the
input encoding. For instance, this erases any f-ligature
characters from the encoding: <br>
% UNICODING ff =: ; fi =: ; fl =: ; ffi =: ; ffl =: ; <br>
The slots are available for otftfm&rsquo;s own use, for
example for other characters required by the font. (If the
f-ligatures themselves are required by the font, for
instance by a <br>
&rsquo;liga&rsquo; feature, then they will be stored into
their old slots when possible.) Map a glyph to
&rsquo;emptyslot&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t want otftotfm to
use the slot. For example, this will <br>
leave the &rsquo;ff&rsquo; slot unused if the font has no
&rsquo;ff&rsquo; glyph: <br>
% UNICODING ff =: ff emptyslot ; <br>
(Note that most OpenType fonts provide a visible
representation for unused encoding slots, namely a box with
an X inside.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIGKERN comments in the encoding
can add ligatures and inhibit kerns, as in afm2tfm(1). To
add a ligature, say: <br>
% LIGKERN glyph1 glyph2 =: result ; <br>
The &quot;=:&quot; operator indicates a normal ligature,
where both the input glyphs are removed and replaced by
result. To preserve the left-hand glyph, for an effect like
&quot;glyph1 glyph2 <br>
=: glyph1 result&quot;, use &quot;|=:&quot; instead; to
preserve the right-hand glyph, use &quot;=:|&quot;. To
remove all kerns between two characters, say: <br>
% LIGKERN glyph1 {} glyph2 ; <br>
A &quot;*&quot; matches any character, so <br>
% LIGKERN a {} * ; <br>
removes all kerns with &quot;a&quot; as the left-hand
character, and <br>
% LIGKERN * {} * ; <br>
removes all kerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otftotfm also supports extended
syntax for setting kern values and inhibiting ligatures. To
add an n-unit kern between two glyphs, say: <br>
% LIGKERNX glyph1 {n} glyph2 ; <br>
where n is an integer. This: <br>
% LIGKERNX glyph1 {L} glyph2 ; <br>
inhibits any ligature between glyph1 and glyph2.
&quot;{LK}&quot; and &quot;{KL}&quot; inhibit both ligatures
and kerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set the --boundary-char
and --altselector-char from an encoding file with commands
like this: <br>
% LIGKERN || = boundarychar ; <br>
% LIGKERNX ^^ = altselectorchar ; <br>
As with UNICODING, each LIGKERN or LIGKERNX line can contain
multiple commands, separated by spaced semicolons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otftotfm has a default set of
eight ligatures, namely: <br>
space l =: lslash ; space L =: Lslash ; <br>
question quoteleft =: questiondown ; exclam quoteleft =:
exclamdown ; <br>
hyphen hyphen =: endash ; endash hyphen =: emdash ; <br>
quoteleft quoteleft =: quotedblleft ; <br>
quoteright quoteright =: quotedblright <br>
LIGKERN commands in the encoding file and --ligkern options
can override these defaults, or supply the
--no-default-ligkern option to turn them off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The POSITION command shifts a
glyph within its bounding box. The syntax is <br>
% POSITION glyph pdx pdy adx ; <br>
This will add pdx units of space to glyph&rsquo;s left edge;
raise it up by pdy units; and add adx units to its width.
For example, to add 10 units of space to either side of the
&quot;T&quot; <br>
glyph, supply <br>
% POSITION T 10 0 20 <br>
To move the &quot;degree&quot; symbol up by 20 units, supply
<br>
% POSITION degree 0 20 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CODINGSCHEME command
specifies the coding scheme for fonts using this encoding.
This is a string, less than 40 characters long and
containing no parentheses, that classifies <br>
the encoding for TeX&rsquo;s purposes. Sample coding schemes
include &quot;TEX TEXT&quot;, &quot;TEX MATH ITALIC&quot;,
and &quot;EXTENDED TEX FONT ENCODING - LATIN&quot;. For
example: <br>
% CODINGSCHEME EXTENDED TEX FONT ENCODING - LATIN <br>
Most tools ignore the coding scheme; fontinst is an
exception. Otftotfm uses the encoding&rsquo;s PostScript
name for the default coding scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the WARNMISSING command
makes any glyphs not supported by the input font appear as
black boxes. The dvips(1) processor will also print a
warning when encountering these <br>
glyphs. For example: <br>
% WARNMISSING yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --unicoding, --ligkern,
--position, --coding-scheme, and --warn-missing options add
UNICODING, LIGKERN/LIGKERNX, POSITION, CODINGSCHEME, and
WARNMISSING commands to an encod&acirc; <br>
ing, and can override commands in the encoding itself. Some
common encoding files have commands that are inappropriate
for OpenType fonts; for example, &quot;t1.enc&quot;
hard-codes f- <br>
ligatures, which can cause problems with small-cap fonts.
Supply the --no-encoding-commands option to ignore all
commands from the encoding file. Commands from options like
<br>
--ligkern are processed in any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Glyphs <br>
New glyphs, such as ligatures and contextual substitutions,
are added to the encoding in any empty spaces, using their
original locations when possible. If the encoding
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
have enough space for all new glyphs, shorter ligatures
composed of unaccented letters get precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synthetic Glyphs <br>
Otftotfm can synthesize some glyphs using virtual font
manipulations, if a required glyph is not available in the
input font. Specifically, it will synthesize:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwm TeX&rsquo;s compound word
mark (a zero-width &quot;strut&quot; rule with height equal
to the font&rsquo;s x-height) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLYPH PATTERNS <br>
The --include-subs and --include-alternates options, and
their --exclude and --*-filter variants, accept the
following types of pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Glyph names.
Example: &quot;Aacute&quot;. For PostScript-flavored fonts,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURE DIRECTORY <br>
This section lists features common to Western OpenType fonts
and describes how otftotfm handles them for common fonts.
Please send the author mail if otftotfm does not handle a
<br>
feature you need, or you believe it handles some feature
incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aalt, Access All Alternates <br>
Lets the user choose between all available alternate forms
for a character. This includes things like superscript and
subscript variants, different styles (swash, for exam&acirc;
<br>
ple), and even ornaments. The --altselector-feature=aalt
option can help an --altselector-char provide useful access
to alternates, but the aalt feature isn&rsquo;t usually
use&acirc; <br>
ful on its own. Try the salt and calt features instead. <br>
c2sc, Small Capitals From Capitals <br>
Replaces capital letters with small capitals: a sort of
converse of the more conventional smcp feature, which
replaces lower-case letters with small capitals. Supported.
<br>
calt, Contextual Alternates <br>
Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms
for each character. For example, given the word
&quot;DREW&quot; in a cursive typeface, the &quot;R E
W&quot; might be translated <br>
to calmer forms than the initial &quot;D&quot;. There may be
more than one choice for a given letter, in which case the
user should be able to select among them. TeX can&rsquo;t
support <br>
complex contextual alternates, or alternate selection, but
otftotfm supports some fonts quite well. The input encoding
should have lots of empty space for variants, and it <br>
should specify a boundary character. See also cswh. <br>
case, Case-Sensitive Forms <br>
Shifts punctuation marks up to a position that works well
with all-capital-letter sequences. For example, the hyphen
character, which generally centers vertically on the x- <br>
height, is raised up to center vertically on a capital
letter. Also replaces text figures with lining figures, and
accent marks with forms more appropriate for capitals. <br>
Supported. <br>
cpsp, Capital Spacing <br>
Adds a bit of space on either side of each capital letter.
Supported. (However, the OpenType tag registry suggests that
cpsp be on by default, but applying to all-caps <br>
text only; TeX cannot easily implement that contextual
intelligence.) <br>
cswh, Contextual Swash <br>
Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms
for each character. For example, in the words &quot;Ab
AC&quot;, the first &quot;A&quot; might be translated to a
swash form, while <br>
the second might not. There may be more than one choice for
a given letter, in which case the user should be able to
select among them. Otftotfm supports some fonts quite <br>
well. The input encoding should have lots of empty space for
swash variants, and it should specify a boundary character.
See also calt and swsh. <br>
dlig, Discretionary Ligatures <br>
Activates uncommon ligatures, such as &quot;c_t&quot;,
&quot;s_p&quot;, and &quot;s_t&quot;. Supported. <br>
dnom, Denominators <br>
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller
forms sitting on the baseline, intended for fraction
denominators. Supported. <br>
fina, Terminal Forms <br>
Substitutes appropriate forms for letters occurring at the
ends of words. This feature doesn&rsquo;t select swash
variants; it&rsquo;s intended for normal use, and the
specification <br>
recommends that it be on by default. Partially supported:
TeX will only treat spaces as the ends of words, where a
correct implementation would probably include punctuation
<br>
too. See cswh for selecting swash variants active at the
ends of words. <br>
frac, Fractions <br>
Replaces simple sequences like &quot;1/2&quot; with
nice-looking fractions. Supported, but beware: many fonts
will translate &quot;11/32&quot; into &quot;1&quot; +
&quot;1/3&quot; + &quot;2&quot;. <br>
hist, Historical Forms <br>
Replaces characters with historical variants. Usually, this
means at least translating regular &quot;s&quot; to long
&quot;s&quot;. Supported. <br>
kern, Kerning <br>
Adjusts the space between characters (pair kerning).
Generally supported, and you should probably turn it on. As
a special case, &quot;-fkern&quot; can also read kerning
information <br>
from the &quot;kern&quot; table in conventional TrueType
fonts. <br>
liga, Standard Ligatures <br>
Activates common ligatures, such as &quot;f_f&quot;,
&quot;f_i&quot;, &quot;f_f_j&quot;, and (in some Adobe
fonts) &quot;T_h&quot;. Generally supported, and you should
probably turn it on. <br>
lnum, Lining Figures <br>
Uses lining figures, the set of digits that are all about as
high as capital letters. Supported. Compare onum; see also
pnum and tnum. <br>
numr, Numerators <br>
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller,
raised forms intended for fraction numerators. Supported,
but not usually useful. <br>
onum, Oldstyle Figures <br>
Uses old-style figures, also known as text figures. This is
the set of digits that have ascenders and descenders like
lower-case letters. Supported. Compare lnum; see <br>
also pnum and tnum. <br>
ordn, Ordinals <br>
Designed for Spanish and French. Replaces ordinal numbers,
such as &quot;2.o&quot;, with forms where the &quot;o&quot;
is raised, and replaces the sequence &quot;No&quot; with an
integrated glyph. Sup&acirc; <br>
ported. <br>
ornm, Ornaments <br>
Replaces some alphabetic characters in the font with
ornaments, and links the bullet character to a set of all
bullet-like ornaments, from which the user can choose.
Par&acirc; <br>
tially supported: TeX can handle alphabetic substitutions,
but not bullet choice. <br>
pnum, Proportional Figures <br>
Digits will have different widths. Supported. Compare tnum;
see also lnum and onum. <br>
salt, Stylistic Alternates <br>
Lets the user choose between stylistic alternate forms for a
character. The --altselector-char mechanism provides useful
access to this feature. If you turn on salt glob&acirc; <br>
ally, otftotfm takes the first alternate form whenever
there&rsquo;s more than one choice. See also aalt and ss01;
salt is generally more useful than aalt for TeX, since it
<br>
refers exclusively to stylistic alternates. <br>
sinf, Scientific Inferiors <br>
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller,
lowered forms intended for subscripts. Supported. Compare
subs. <br>
size, Optical Size <br>
This feature stores information about the range of optical
sizes for which the font was intended. There is no point in
selecting it with otftotfm, since it should not <br>
change the font&rsquo;s appearance in any way. <br>
smcp, Small Capitals <br>
Replaces lower-case letters with small capitals. Supported.
Compare c2sc. <br>
ss01-ss20, Stylistic Sets 1-20 <br>
Replaces characters with a uniform set of stylistic
alternates. Differs from features like salt in that a
Stylistic Set is uniform: an ssXX feature should never
involve <br>
selection from a set of possible alternate characters.
Supported. <br>
subs, Subscript <br>
Replaces characters with smaller, lowered forms intended for
subscripts. Supported. Compare sinf; some fonts support sinf
but not subs. <br>
sups, Superscript <br>
Replaces digits, some punctuation marks, and some lower-case
letters with smaller, raised forms intended for
superscripts. Supported. <br>
swsh, Swash <br>
Activates all swash forms for each character. There may be
more than one swash form, in which case otftotfm will pick
the first one listed. Supported, except that swash <br>
variants other than the first are inaccessible. Note that
some fonts with swash variants support the cswh feature
exclusively. <br>
tnum, Tabular Figures <br>
All digits will have the same width, so that tables and the
like will align visually. Supported. Compare pnum; see also
lnum and onum. <br>
zero, Slashed Zero <br>
Replaces the zero character with a slashed zero.
Supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS AND TROUBLESHOOTING

no writable directory found in $TEXMF <br>
Otftotfm could not find a writable directory in your

(or ligature removal, lig/kern removal, or ligature) <br>
These messages indicate a slight problem with your encoding
file: one of the LIGKERN commands referred to a character
not present in the encoding. This might be due to a <br>
misspelling in the LIGKERN command or the encoding file, or
it might be an oversight. Either fix the encoding file or
ignore the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can&rsquo;t map
&rsquo;char&rsquo; to Unicode <br>
Another encoding file problem: One of the glyph names in an
UNICODING block could not be converted to Unicode. This is
problematic since UNICODING exists wholly to trans&acirc;
<br>
late glyph names into Unicode. Fix the encoding file or
ignore the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">not enough room in encoding,
ignoring N glyph(s) ... <br>
There wasn&rsquo;t space in the encoding for all the glyphs
referred to by the features you selected. For example, maybe
the font had more ligatures than there were empty slots <br>
in the encoding. Fix this warning by selecting fewer
features, or by using an encoding with more empty slots,
such as the 7t.enc encoding distributed with otftotfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;-a&rsquo; option did
not install my font correctly. <br>
Try again with the &rsquo;--verbose&rsquo; option, which
causes otftotfm to explain its behavior. Note that by
default, otftotfm will not re-install files already present
in your sys&acirc; <br>
tem&rsquo;s TeX search paths (in the current directory, for
instance). Use &rsquo;--force&rsquo; to override this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS <br>
How can I get a small-caps &quot;SS&quot; in place of the
German sharp-S? <br>
Supply the option &rsquo;--unicoding &quot;germandbls =:
SSsmall&quot;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I prevent f-ligatures
from forming in a small-caps font? <br>
This should happen automatically, but some overzealous
encoding files add f-ligatures even when the font
doesn&rsquo;t request them. Try the
&quot;--no-encoding-commands&quot; option if <br>
this is a problem for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otftotfm seems to take a long
time. <br>
Use the -V option to see what it&rsquo;s doing. Often the
culprit is the updmap(1) program; if you&rsquo;re planning
to run otftotfm multiple times, give it the --no-updmap
option and <br>
run updmap manually when you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I refer to the different
forms of phi? <br>
Otftotfm follows TeX practice and widely-distributed TeX
encoding vectors, so &quot;/phi&quot; in an input encoding
vector should map to a &quot;straight&quot; phi and
&quot;/phi1&quot; should map to a <br>
&quot;loopy&quot; phi. Note that TeX practice differs from
the PostScript standard naming conventions, in which
&quot;/phi&quot; is &quot;loopy&quot; and &quot;/phi1&quot;
is &quot;straight&quot;; this means that otftotfm <br>
may map &quot;/phi&quot; in an input encoding vector to a
font&rsquo;s &quot;/phi1&quot; glyph, and vice versa.
Perhaps most unambiguously, you can use &quot;/uni03D5&quot;
for the &quot;straight&quot; form and <br>
&quot;/uni03C6&quot; for the &quot;loopy&quot; form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I get lining figures
(that is, normal line-height digits) with small caps
(&rsquo;-fsmcp&rsquo;)? <br>
Many fonts use old-style figures by default with small caps.
Since the default is not specified, it&rsquo;s wise to
explicitly supply &rsquo;-flnum&rsquo; or
&rsquo;-fonum&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
See the documentation for --pl above if you have problems
running otftotfm&rsquo;s output through fontinst.</p>
