<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ramsgate - Remote AMS gateway daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ramsgate application_name authority_name [bundles_TTL]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ramsgate is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that
functions as a Remote AMS gateway. application_name and
authority_name must identify an AMS venture that is known to
operate in the <br>
local continuum, as noted in the MIB for the ramsgate
application module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ramsgate will register as an
application module in the root unit of the indicated
venture, so a configuration server for the local continuum
and a registrar for the root unit of <br>
the indicated venture (which may both be instantiated in a
single amsd daemon task) must be running in order for
ramsgate to commence operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ramsgate with communicate with
other RAMS gateway modules in other continua by means of the
RAMS network protocol noted in the RAMS gateway endpoint ID
for the local continuum, <br>
as identified (explicitly or implicitly) in the MIB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the RAMS network protocol is
&quot;bp&quot; (i.e., the DTN Bundle Protocol), then an ION
Bundle Protocol node must be operating on the local computer
and that node must be registered in <br>
the BP endpoint identified by the RAMS gateway endpoint ID
for the local continuum. Moreover, in this case the value of
bundles_TTL - if specified - will be taken as the <br>
lifetime in seconds that is to be declared for all
&quot;bundles&quot; issued by ramsgate; bundles_TTL defaults
to 86400 seconds (one day) if omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; ramsgate terminated normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; ramsgate failed,
for reasons noted in the ion.log file; the task
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name
(see amsrc(5)) must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ramsgate records all
&quot;petitions&quot; (requests for data on behalf of AMS
modules in other continua) in a file named
&quot;petition.log&quot;. At startup, the ramsgate daemon
automatically <br>
reads and processes all petitions in the petition.log file
just as if they were received in real time. Note that this
means that you can cause petitions to be, in effect,
&quot;pre- <br>
received&quot; by simply editing this file prior to startup.
This can be an especially effective way to configure a RAMS
network in which long signal propagation times would <br>
otherwise retard real-time petitioning and thus delay the
onset of fully functional message exchange.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ramsgate can&rsquo;t run. <br>
RAMS gateway functionality failed, for reasons noted in the
ion.log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Note that the AMS design principle of receiving messages
immediately and enqueuing them for eventual ingestion by the
application module - rather than imposing application-layer
<br>
flow control on AMS message traffic - enables high
performance but makes ramsgate vulnerable to message spikes.
Since production and transmission of bundles is typically
slower <br>
than AMS message reception over TCP service, the ION working
memory and/or heap space available for AMS event insertion
and/or bundle production can be quickly exhausted if a <br>
high rate of application message production is sustained for
a long enough time. Mechanisms for defending against this
sort of failure are under study, but for now the best <br>
mitigations are simply to (a) build with compiler option
-DAMS_INDUSTRIAL=1, (b) allocate as much space as possible
to ION working memory and SDR heap (see ionconfig(5)) and
(c) <br>
limit the rate of AMS message issuance.</p>
