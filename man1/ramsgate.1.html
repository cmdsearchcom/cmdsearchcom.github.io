ramsgate - Remote AMS gateway daemon

<b>ramsgate</b> <i>application_name</i> <i>authority_name</i>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>ramsgate</b> is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that functions as a
  Remote AMS gateway. <i>application_name</i> and <i>authority_name</i> must
  identify an AMS venture that is known to operate in the local continuum, as
  noted in the MIB for the <b>ramsgate</b> application module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ramsgate</b> will register as an application module in the root unit of the
  indicated venture, so a configuration server for the local continuum and a
  registrar for the root unit of the indicated venture (which may both be
  instantiated in a single <b>amsd</b> daemon task) must be running in order for
  <b>ramsgate</b> to commence operations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ramsgate</b> with communicate with other RAMS gateway modules in other
  continua by means of the RAMS network protocol noted in the RAMS gateway
  endpoint ID for the local continuum, as identified (explicitly or implicitly)
  in the MIB.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the RAMS network protocol is &quot;bp&quot; (i.e., the DTN Bundle Protocol),
  then an ION Bundle Protocol node must be operating on the local computer and
  that node must be registered in the BP endpoint identified by the RAMS gateway
  endpoint ID for the local continuum. Moreover, in this case the value of
  <i>bundles_TTL</i> - if specified - will be taken as the lifetime in seconds
  that is to be declared for all &quot;bundles&quot; issued by <b>ramsgate</b>;
  <i>bundles_TTL</i> defaults to 86400 seconds (one day) if omitted.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name (see <i>amsrc</i>(5))
  must be present.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ramsgate</b> records all &quot;petitions&quot; (requests for data on behalf
  of AMS modules in other continua) in a file named &quot;petition.log&quot;. At
  startup, the <b>ramsgate</b> daemon automatically reads and processes all
  petitions in the petition.log file just as if they were received in real time.
  <b>Note</b> that this means that you can cause petitions to be, in effect,
  &quot;pre-received&quot; by simply editing this file prior to startup. This
  can be an especially effective way to configure a RAMS network in which long
  signal propagation times would otherwise retard real-time petitioning and thus
  delay the onset of fully functional message exchange.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
No environment variables apply.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ramsgate can't run.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">RAMS gateway functionality failed, for reasons noted in the
      ion.log file.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Note that the AMS design principle of receiving messages immediately and
  enqueuing them for eventual ingestion by the application module - rather than
  imposing application-layer flow control on AMS message traffic - enables high
  performance but makes <b>ramsgate</b> vulnerable to message spikes. Since
  production and transmission of bundles is typically slower than AMS message
  reception over TCP service, the ION working memory and/or heap space available
  for AMS event insertion and/or bundle production can be quickly exhausted if a
  high rate of application message production is sustained for a long enough
  time. Mechanisms for defending against this sort of failure are under study,
  but for now the best mitigations are simply to (a) build with compiler option
  -DAMS_INDUSTRIAL=1, (b) allocate as much space as possible to ION working
  memory and SDR heap (see <i>ionconfig</i>(5)) and (c) limit the rate of AMS
  message issuance.
