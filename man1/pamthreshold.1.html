<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamthreshold - threshold grayscale image to black and
white</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamthreshold [-simple] [-local=widthxheight]
[-dual=widthxheight] [-threshold=threshold]
[-contrast=threshold] [inputpamfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviations of
options are acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead
of a single hyphen to denote options. You may use white
space in place of the equals <br>
sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamthreshold thresholds a
grayscale image. Thresholding means dividing the image into
background and foreground by comparing every pixel to a
thresholding value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input should be a PGM image
or a PAM image of tuple type GRAYSCALE or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA.
However, pamthreshold doesn&rsquo;t check; it just
thresholds the first channel as if it <br>
were grayscale samples and if there is a second channel,
processes it as if it is an alpha (transparency) channel. So
if you feed it e.g. a PPM image, it will work but produce
<br>
probably useless results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is a PAM with tuple
type BLACKANDWHITE or BLACKANDWHITE_ALPHA, depending on
whether the input has an alpha channel. You can turn this
into a PBM (if you need to use <br>
it with an older program that doesn&rsquo;t understand PAM,
or you can&rsquo;t afford the 8X amount of space that PAM
uses for the image) with pamtopnm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is to Standard
Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the input has an alpha
channel, pamthreshold includes an alpha channel in the
output. Since the output has maxval 1, the alpha channel can
indicate only fully transparent <br>
or fully opaque. pamthreshold make it fully transparent
where the input is more than half transparent and fully
opaque where it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alpha function was new in
Netpbm 10.43 (June 2008). Before that, pamthreshold ignores
any alpha channel in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to convert a
grayscale image to black and white is to dither. Dithering
is using clustered black and white pixels such that if you
step back and look at the picture, <br>
you see varying levels of gray. pamditherbw does
dithering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Without any options, pamthreshold uses a method based on the
iterative algorithm found in the wikipedia
&acirc;&uml;http://www.wikipedia.org/&acirc;&copy; article
<br>
Thresholding (image processing)
&acirc;&uml;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_%28image_processing%29&acirc;&copy;
to compute the thresholding value. ( this version <br>

&acirc;&uml;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thresholding_%28image_processing%29&amp;oldid=132306976&acirc;&copy;
of the Wikipedia article was current at the time of this
writing). It uses this <br>
threshold to globally threshold the image. This should work
well for most images. The program issues a message telling
you what threshold it used. (Netpbm messages go to
Stan&acirc; <br>
dard Error, and you can turn them off with the Netpbm common
option -quiet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options -simple, -local, and
-dual select other methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-simple <br>
This selects simple or global thresholding, i.e.
pamthreshold compares every pixel to the threshold you
specify with -threshold. Those with a brightness greater
than or <br>
equal to the threshold become white; others become black.
This works well for black and white text pages scanned with
a flatbed scanner and is faster than the default <br>
method that iteratively determines the thresholding value
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-local=widthxheight <br>
This selects local adaptive thresholding (also known as
dynamic thresholding) using the neighborhood which is the
square width pixels wide and height pixels high centered
<br>
on the pixel in question. pamthreshold computes the
threshold individually for each pixel of the image. This can
accommodate changing lighting conditions in the image. <br>
Depending on the size of the neighborhood this can be quite
slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dual=widthxheight <br>
This selects a dual thresholding algorithm using a global
threshold for low contrast neighborhoods and local
thresholding otherwise. This can preserve larger back- <br>
respectively foreground areas than local adaptive
thresholding. This algorithm was proposed in the paper
&quot;An Approach To Licence Plate Recognition&quot; by J.R.
Parker and <br>
Pavol Federl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-threshold=threshold <br>
This sets the thresholding value for simple or local
thresholding. The value is a floating point number in the
range [0, 1] directly proportional to the Netpbm sample <br>
values, where 0 corresponds to black and 1 to the maxval of
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify this
option, pamthreshold uses a threshold of 0.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without -simple, -local, or
-dual, this option is meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meaning of the threshold
depends upon the kind of thresholding you do (as determined
by other options). Roughly, pixels at least as bright as the
threshold become <br>
white in the output while others become black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-contrast=threshold <br>
This sets the threshold to determine if a neighborhood has
low contrast or not for dual thresholding. The value is a
floating point number in the range [0, 1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify this
option, pamthreshold uses a contrast threshold of 0.05.
Without -dual this option is meaningless.</p>
