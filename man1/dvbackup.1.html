<p>DVBACKUP(1) General Commands Manual DVBACKUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvbackup &acirc; Converter from arbitrary data to a DV
stream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvbackup [--version] [-n|--ntsc-mode] [-d|--decode]
[-t|--verify] [-b|--set-backup-title=TITLE]
[--set-picture=PPM-FILE] [-v|--verbose] [-p|--prefix=COUNT]
[--test=COUNT] <br>
[-r|--recover] [--enable-audio] [-?|--help] [--usage]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the dvbackup tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page was written for
the Debian distribution because the original program does
not have a manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you probably know, current
digital camcorders can save approximately 13 GB of data on
those tiny DV cartridges at a speed of 3.6 MB/second.
That&rsquo;s fast. Very fast. It&rsquo;s faster <br>
than most DAT streamers which only work at 1 MB/sec or less.
We can not use all of the data, but 10 GB should be good
enough for everyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s nice, but how can
we use this to save data on it? And here comes the fun part:
If you read the DV documentation carefully, you will notice
that the AC DCT coefficients of <br>
the video data blocks (8x8 pixels in size) get a fixed
amount of space in the DV data stream, but can be terminated
earlier with a certain code sequence. So let&rsquo;s have
some fun: <br>
We terminate the AC coefficients immediately leaving only
the DC coefficient for a fancy penguin picture and use the
rest for our backup data. Future implementations could
easily <br>
add a little picture showing the currently written file or
something like that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then there is the audio data,
which is written uncompressed onto the tape. That means: We
tell the camcorder at the beginning of each frame, that we
won&rsquo;t use audio at all but <br>
fill the space reserved for it with data. Easy, but somewhat
hacky. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know, if this works on every
camcorder and not only on mine (a Sony VX700). Your mileage
may <br>
vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To finally bring the data on
tape, you have to use an additional utility, called
dvconnect, which is (hopefully soon) included into libdv.
Take a look at the patch manager if <br>
it&rsquo;s not in already. And then it&rsquo;s time to rock
and roll:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advantages of dvbackup over
other backup technologies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relatively cheap (the cheapest
camcorder will be enough, but if you have already
one...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the tapes are quite cheap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open standard: if your streamer,
aah camcorder dies you can rescue your data with any other
one (except PAL/NTSC need to fit), you are not bound to a
special company</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it&rsquo;s faster than many
streamers and it will be more comfortable - you can use the
search-index function to &quot;jump&quot; to a recording</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tapes (re)wind faster than many
streamers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you do not need to rewind the
tape to eject it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disadvantages of dvbackup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you do not get any warranty
:-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage of the Unix client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press record on your camcorder.
(Or use your favorite avc control program for this. For the
VX700 this doesn&rsquo;t work and you have to hack something
together, that uses <br>
LANC. I might publish my &quot;solution&quot; for this
soon...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type &quot;find . |cpio -o -H
crc |dvbackup --prefix=125 |dvconnect -s&quot; to stream
directly to your camcorder. This most likely does only work
on very fast harddisks and <br>
filesystems. You might try something like &quot;find . |cpio
-o -H crc |dvbackup --prefix=125 |dvconnect -s -b 500&quot;
Alternatively, you can write the data in several parts on
<br>
tape. Just go experimenting, and mail me the resulting
backup scripts...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stop your camcorder and
rewind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now it&rsquo;s time to verify:
Press play on tape ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type &quot;dvconnect |dvbackup
-t&quot; and watch for crc errors. The data corruption bug
mentioned for version 0.0.1 seems to be fixed so there is no
excuse in not using this <br>
little nifty program ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to restore: Do a
simple &quot;dvconnect |dvbackup -d|cpio -imV&quot;. CPIO
will also happily tell you about CRC errors. So you might
want to check using cpio&rsquo;s ar&acirc; <br>
chive test mode too. But keep in mind, that cpio&rsquo;s CRC
function is not that fast!</p>
