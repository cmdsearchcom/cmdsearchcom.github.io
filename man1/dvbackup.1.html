This manual page documents briefly the <b>dvbackup</b> tool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manual page was written for the <b>Debian</b> distribution because the
  original program does not have a manual page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As you probably know, current digital camcorders can save approximately 13 GB of
  data on those tiny DV cartridges at a speed of 3.6 MB/second. That's fast.
  Very fast. It's faster than most DAT streamers which only work at 1 MB/sec or
  less. We can not use all of the data, but 10 GB should be good enough for
  everyone.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's nice, but how can we use this to save data on it? And here comes the fun
  part: If you read the DV documentation carefully, you will notice that the AC
  DCT coefficients of the video data blocks (8x8 pixels in size) get a fixed
  amount of space in the DV data stream, but can be terminated earlier with a
  certain code sequence. So let's have some fun: We terminate the AC
  coefficients immediately leaving only the DC coefficient for a fancy penguin
  picture and use the rest for our backup data. Future implementations could
  easily add a little picture showing the currently written file or something
  like that.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then there is the audio data, which is written uncompressed onto the tape. That
  means: We tell the camcorder at the beginning of each frame, that we won't use
  audio at all but fill the space reserved for it with data. Easy, but somewhat
  hacky. In fact, I don't know, if this works on every camcorder and not only on
  mine (a Sony VX700). Your mileage may vary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To finally bring the data on tape, you have to use an additional utility, called
  dvconnect, which is (hopefully soon) included into libdv. Take a look at the
  patch manager if it's not in already. And then it's time to rock and roll:

Advantages of dvbackup over other backup technologies

Usage of the Unix client
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Press record on your camcorder. (Or use your favorite avc
      control program for this. For the VX700 this doesn't work and you have to
      hack something together, that uses LANC. I might publish my
      &quot;solution&quot; for this soon...)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Type &quot;find . |cpio -o -H crc |dvbackup --prefix=125
      |dvconnect -s&quot; to stream directly to your camcorder. This most likely
      does only work on very fast harddisks and filesystems. You might try
      something like &quot;find . |cpio -o -H crc |dvbackup --prefix=125
      |dvconnect -s -b 500&quot; Alternatively, you can write the data in
      several parts on tape. Just go experimenting, and mail me the resulting
      backup scripts...</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Type &quot;dvconnect |dvbackup -t&quot; and watch for crc
      errors. The data corruption bug mentioned for version 0.0.1 seems to be
      fixed so there is no excuse in not using this little nifty program
    ;-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you want to restore: Do a simple &quot;dvconnect
      |dvbackup -d|cpio -imV&quot;. CPIO will also happily tell you about CRC
      errors. So you might want to check using cpio's archive test mode too. But
      keep in mind, that cpio's CRC function is not that fast!</dd>
