<p>techtalk-pse(1) Presentation Software
techtalk-pse(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
techtalk-pse - superior technical demonstration software</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cd /path/to/talk/; techtalk-pse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">techtalk-pse /path/to/talk/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Tech Talk &quot;Platinum Supreme Edition&quot; (PSE) is
Linux Presentation Software designed by technical people to
give technical software demonstrations to other technical
people. It is <br>
designed to be simple to use (for people who know how to use
an editor and the command line) and powerful, so that you
can create informative, technically accurate and <br>
entertaining talks and demonstrations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tech Talk PSE is good at opening
editors at the right place, opening shell prompts with
preloaded history, compiling and running things during the
demonstration, displaying text, <br>
photos, figures and video.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tech Talk PSE is bad at slide
effects, chart junk and bullet points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page covers all the
documentation you will need to use Tech Talk PSE. The next
section covers running the tool from the command line. After
that there is a <br>
&quot;TUTORIAL&quot; section to get you started. Then there
is a detailed &quot;REFERENCE&quot; section. Finally there
is a discussion on &quot;WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING THE TOOL FROM THE
COMMAND LINE <br>
Tech Talk PSE talks are just directories containing
&quot;*.html&quot;, &quot;*.sh&quot; (shell script) and
&quot;*.term&quot; (terminal) files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0010-introduction.html <br>
0500-demonstration.sh <br>
0600-command-line.term <br>
9900-conclusion.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filenames that Tech Talk PSE
considers to be slides have to match the regular
expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^(+)(?:-.*).(html|sh|term)$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(any other file or subdirectory
is ignored). Shell scripts and terminal files must be
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAYING AN EXISTING TALK <br>
To display or run a talk, change into the directory
containing all those files and run the
&quot;techtalk-pse&quot; command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd /path/to/talk/;
techtalk-pse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also run
&quot;techtalk-pse&quot; without changing directory, instead
specifying the path to the talk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">techtalk-pse /path/to/talk/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help <br>
Display brief help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--last <br>
Start at the last slide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot use this with the -n
/ --start option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n SLIDE | --start SLIDE <br>
Start at the named slide. SLIDE is the shortest unique
prefix of the slide name, so to start at a slide named
00010-introduction.html, you could use -n 00010 or -n <br>
00010-intro, or give the full filename -n
00010-introduction.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to start at the
first slide in the talk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Display verbose messages, useful for debugging or tracing
what the program is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TUTORIAL <br>
START WRITING A TALK <br>
[Before you start writing your real talk, I urge you to read
&quot;WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK&quot; below].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start your talk, all you have
to do is to make a new directory somewhere:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir talk <br>
cd talk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tech talk consists of HTML
files (&quot;slides&quot;) and shell scripts. The filenames
must start with a number, followed optionally by a
description, followed by the extension <br>
(&quot;.html&quot;, &quot;.sh&quot; or &quot;.term&quot;).
So to start our talk with two slides:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;This is the
introduction&quot; &gt; 0010-introduction.html <br>
echo &quot;This is the second slide&quot; &gt;
0020-second.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run it, run the command from
within the talk directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">techtalk-pse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other file in the directory
is ignored, so if you want to add Makefiles, version control
files etc, just go ahead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS FOR WRITING HTML <br>
You may have your own techniques and tools for writing HTML,
so this section is just to share my ideas. I start every
HTML file with a standard stylesheet and Javascript
header:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;link
rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;
type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt; <br>
&lt;script src=&quot;code.js&quot;
type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That just ensures that I can put
common styling instructions for all my slides in a single
file (&quot;style.css&quot;), and I have one place where I
can add all Javascript, if I need to <br>
use any (&quot;code.js&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUNDS, FONTS AND LOGOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add a common background and
font size to all slides, put this in
&quot;style.css&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body { <br>
font-size: 24pt; <br>
background: url(background-image.jpg) no-repeat; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add a logo in one corner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body { <br>
background: url(logo.jpg) top right no-repeat; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALING AND CENTERING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scaling slide text and images so
that they appear at the same proportionate size for any
screen resolution can be done using Javascript. (See <br>

&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/window.innerHeight&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to center text
horizontally, use CSS, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p.center { <br>
text-align: center; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To center text vertically, CSS3
is supposed to offer a solution some time, but while
you&rsquo;re waiting for that try
&lt;http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center#vertical&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREVIEWING HTML</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I find it helpful to have
Firefox open to display the HTML files and styles as I edit
them. Just start firefox in the talk directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">firefox file://$(pwd) &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you edit an HTML file,
click the Firefox reload button to immediately see your
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tech Talk PSE uses WebKit
embedding to display HTML. HTML is standardized enough
nowadays that what you see in Firefox and other browsers
should be the same as what Tech Talk <br>
PSE displays. WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari) should
be identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING FIGURES <br>
Use your favorite tool to draw the figure, convert it to an
image (in any format that the Mozilla engine can display)
and include it using an &quot;&lt;img&gt;&quot; tag, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;img
src=&quot;fig1.gif&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suitable tools include:
Inkscape, XFig, GnuPlot, GraphViz, and many TeX tools such
as PicTex and in particular TikZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMBEDDING VIDEOS, ANIMATIONS,
ETC. <br>
Using HTML 5, embedding videos in the browser is easy. See:
&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For animations, you could try
Haxe &lt;http://haxe.org/&gt; which has a Javascript
back-end. There are many other possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are sure that the venue
will have an internet connection, why not embed a YouTube
video.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAYING EXISTING WEB PAGES
<br>
Obviously you could just have an HTML file that contains a
redirect to the public web page:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;meta
http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;
url=http://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However if you want your talk to
work offline, then it&rsquo;s better to download the web
page in advance, eg. using Firefox&rsquo;s &quot;Save Page
As -&gt; Web Page, complete&quot; feature, into the <br>
talk directory, then either rename or make a symbolic link
to the slide name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln -s &quot;haXe - Welcome to
haXe.html&quot; 0010-haxe-homepage.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS FOR WRITING SHELL SCRIPTS
<br>
Make sure each &quot;*.sh&quot; or &quot;*.term&quot; file
you write is executable, otherwise Tech Talk PSE won&rsquo;t
be able to run it. (The program gives a warning if you
forget this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The difference between
&quot;*.sh&quot; (shell script) and &quot;*.term&quot; (a
terminal script) is that a shell script runs any commands,
usually graphical commands, whereas a terminal script runs
<br>
in a full screen terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good idea is to start each
script by sourcing some common functions. All my scripts
start with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/bash - <br>
source functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &quot;functions&quot; is
another file (ignored by Tech Talk PSE) which contains
common functions for setting shell history and starting a
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &quot;functions&quot;, I
have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># -*- shell-script -*-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Place any local environment
variables required in &rsquo;local&rsquo;. <br>
if [ -f local ]; then source local; fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export PS1=&quot;$ &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
HISTFILE=$talkdir/history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm -f $HISTFILE <br>
touch $HISTFILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add_history () <br>
{ <br>
echo &quot;$@&quot; &gt;&gt; $HISTFILE <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminal () <br>
{ <br>
# Make $HISTFILE unwritable so the shell won&rsquo;t update
it <br>
# when it exits. <br>
chmod -w $HISTFILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Execute a shell. <br>
bash --norc &quot;$@&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By initializing the shell
history, during your talk you can rapidly recall commands to
start parts of the demonstration just by hitting the Up
arrow. A complete terminal script <br>
from one of my talks would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/bash - <br>
source functions <br>
add_history guestfish -i debian.img <br>
terminal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is just a starting point
for your own scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCE <br>
ORDER OF FILES <br>
Tech Talk PSE displays the slides in the directory in
lexicographic order (the same order as &quot;LANG=C ls
-1&quot;). Only files matching the following regexp are
considered:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^(+)(?:-.*).(html|sh|term)$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For future compatibility, you
should ensure that every slide has a unique numeric part
(ie. don&rsquo;t have &quot;0010-aaa.html&quot; and
&quot;0010-bbb.html&quot;). This is because in future we
want to <br>
have the ability to display multiple files side by side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also for future compatibility,
don&rsquo;t use file names that have an uppercase letter
immediately after the numeric part. This is because in
future we want to allow placement hints <br>
using filenames like &quot;0010L-on-the-left.html&quot; and
&quot;0010R-on-the-right.html&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASE URL AND CURRENT DIRECTORY
<br>
The base URL is set to the be the directory containing the
talk files. Thus you should use relative paths, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;img
src=&quot;fig1.gif&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also place assets into
subdirectories, because subdirectories are ignored by Tech
Talk PSE, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;img
src=&quot;images/fig1.gif&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running shell scripts, the
current directory is also set to be the directory containing
the talk files, so the same rules about using relative paths
apply there too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
$talkdir is exported to scripts and it contains the absolute
path of the directory containing the talk files. When a
script is run, the current <br>
directory is the same as $talkdir, but if your script
changes directory (eg. into a subdirectory containing
supporting files) then it can be useful to use $talkdir to
refer back <br>
to the original directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK <br>
I like what Edward Tufte writes, for example his
evisceration of PowerPoint use at NASA here:
&lt;http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However it is sometimes hard to
translate his ideas into clear presentations, and not all of
that is the fault of the tools. Here are my thoughts and
rules on how to deliver a <br>
good talk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, most important rule:
Before you start drawing any slides at all, write your talk
as a short essay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the number one mistake
that presenters make, and it is partly a tool fault, because
PowerPoint, OpenOffice, even Tech Talk PSE, all open up on
an initial blank slide, <br>
inviting you to write a title and some bullet points. If you
start that way, you will end up using the program as a kind
of clumsy outlining tool, and then reading that outline <br>
to your audience. That&rsquo;s boring and a waste of time
for you and your audience. (It would be quicker for them
just to download the talk and read it at home).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly: How long do you want
to spend preparing the talk? A good talk, with a sound essay
behind it, well thought out diagrams and figures, and
interesting demonstrations, <br>
takes many hours to prepare. How many hours? I would suggest
thinking about how many hours of effort your audience are
putting in. Even just 20 people sitting there for half <br>
an hour is 10 man-hours of attention, and that is a very
small talk, and doesn&rsquo;t include all the extra time and
hassle that it took to get them all in one place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I don&rsquo;t think you can get
away with spending less than two full days preparing a talk,
if you want to master the topic and draw up accurate slides.
Steve Jobs was reputed to <br>
spend weeks preparing his annual sales talk to the Apple
faithful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thirdly: Now that you&rsquo;re
going to write your talk as an essay, what should go in the
slides? I would say that you should consider delivering the
essay, not the slides, to people <br>
who don&rsquo;t make the talk. An essay can be turned into
an article or blog posting, whereas even
&quot;read-out-the-bullet-point&quot; slides have a low
information density, large size, and <br>
end-user compatibility problems (*.pptx anyone?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What, then, goes on the slides?
Anything you cannot just say: diagrams, graphs, videos,
animations, and of course (only with Tech Talk PSE!)
demonstrations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly: Once you&rsquo;ve got
your talk as an essay and slides, practice, practice and
practice again. Deliver the talk to yourself in the mirror,
to your colleagues. Practice going <br>
backwards and forwards through the slides, using your actual
laptop and the software so you know what to click and what
keys to press. Partly memorize what you are going to say
<br>
(but use short notes written on paper if you need to).</p>
