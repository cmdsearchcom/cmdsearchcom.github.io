Tech Talk &quot;Platinum Supreme Edition&quot; (PSE) is Linux Presentation
  Software designed by technical people to give technical software
  demonstrations to other technical people. It is designed to be simple to use
  (for people who know how to use an editor and the command line) and powerful,
  so that you can create informative, technically accurate and entertaining
  talks and demonstrations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tech Talk PSE is good at opening editors at the right place, opening shell
  prompts with preloaded history, compiling and running things during the
  demonstration, displaying text, photos, figures and video.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tech Talk PSE is <i>bad</i> at slide effects, chart junk and bullet points.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manual page covers all the documentation you will need to use Tech Talk
  PSE. The next section covers running the tool from the command line. After
  that there is a &quot;TUTORIAL&quot; section to get you started. Then there is
  a detailed &quot;REFERENCE&quot; section. Finally there is a discussion on
  &quot;WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNNING_THE_TOOL_FROM_THE_COMMAND_LINE"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNNING_THE_TOOL_FROM_THE_COMMAND_LINE">RUNNING
  THE TOOL FROM THE COMMAND LINE</a></h1>
Tech Talk PSE talks are just directories containing &quot;*.html&quot;,
  &quot;*.sh&quot; (shell script) and &quot;*.term&quot; (terminal) files:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 0010-introduction.html
 0500-demonstration.sh
 0600-command-line.term
 9900-conclusion.html
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The filenames that Tech Talk PSE considers to be slides have to match the
  regular expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ^(\d+)(?:-.*)\.(html|sh|term)$
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(any other file or subdirectory is ignored). Shell scripts and terminal files
  <i>must</i> be executable.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DISPLAYING_AN_EXISTING_TALK"><a class="selflink" href="#DISPLAYING_AN_EXISTING_TALK">DISPLAYING

To display or run a talk, change into the directory containing all those files
  and run the &quot;techtalk-pse&quot; command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 cd /path/to/talk/; techtalk-pse
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also run &quot;techtalk-pse&quot; without changing directory, instead
  specifying the path to the talk:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 techtalk-pse /path/to/talk/
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="START_WRITING_A_TALK"><a class="selflink" href="#START_WRITING_A_TALK">START
  WRITING A TALK</a></h2>
[Before you start writing your real talk, I urge you to read &quot;WHAT MAKES A
  GOOD TALK&quot; below].
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start your talk, all you have to do is to make a new directory somewhere:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 mkdir talk
 cd talk
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A tech talk consists of HTML files (&quot;slides&quot;) and shell scripts. The
  filenames must start with a number, followed optionally by a description,
  followed by the extension (&quot;.html&quot;, &quot;.sh&quot; or
  &quot;.term&quot;). So to start our talk with two slides:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 echo &quot;This is the introduction&quot; &gt; 0010-introduction.html
 echo &quot;This is the second slide&quot; &gt; 0020-second.html
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To run it, run the command from within the talk directory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 techtalk-pse
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any other file in the directory is ignored, so if you want to add Makefiles,
  version control files etc, just go ahead.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TIPS_FOR_WRITING_HTML"><a class="selflink" href="#TIPS_FOR_WRITING_HTML">TIPS
  FOR WRITING HTML</a></h2>
You may have your own techniques and tools for writing HTML, so this section is
  just to share my ideas. I start every HTML file with a standard stylesheet and
  Javascript header:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;script src=&quot;code.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That just ensures that I can put common styling instructions for all my slides
  in a single file (&quot;style.css&quot;), and I have one place where I can add
  all Javascript, if I need to use any (&quot;code.js&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>BACKGROUNDS, FONTS AND LOGOS</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To add a common background and font size to all slides, put this in
  &quot;style.css&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 body {
     font-size: 24pt;
     background: url(background-image.jpg) no-repeat;
 }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To add a logo in one corner:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 body {
     background: url(logo.jpg) top right no-repeat;
 }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>SCALING AND CENTERING</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Scaling slide text and images so that they appear at the same proportionate size
  for any screen resolution can be done using Javascript. (See
  &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/window.innerHeight&gt;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to center text horizontally, use CSS, eg:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 p.center {
     text-align: center;
 }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To center text vertically, CSS3 is supposed to offer a solution some time, but
  while you're waiting for that try
  &lt;http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center#vertical&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>PREVIEWING HTML</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I find it helpful to have Firefox open to display the HTML files and styles as I
  edit them. Just start firefox in the talk directory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 firefox file://$(pwd) &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you edit an HTML file, click the Firefox reload button to immediately see
  your changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tech Talk PSE uses WebKit embedding to display HTML. HTML is standardized enough
  nowadays that what you see in Firefox and other browsers should be the same as
  what Tech Talk PSE displays. WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari) should be
  identical.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CREATING_FIGURES"><a class="selflink" href="#CREATING_FIGURES">CREATING
  FIGURES</a></h2>
Use your favorite tool to draw the figure, convert it to an image (in any format
  that the Mozilla engine can display) and include it using an
  &quot;&lt;img&gt;&quot; tag, eg:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;img src=&quot;fig1.gif&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suitable tools include: Inkscape, XFig, GnuPlot, GraphViz, and many TeX tools
  such as PicTex and in particular TikZ.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="EMBEDDING_VIDEOS,_ANIMATIONS,_ETC."><a class="selflink" href="#EMBEDDING_VIDEOS,_ANIMATIONS,_ETC.">EMBEDDING
  VIDEOS, ANIMATIONS, ETC.</a></h2>
Using HTML 5, embedding videos in the browser is easy. See:
  &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
For animations, you could try Haxe &lt;http://haxe.org/&gt; which has a
  Javascript back-end. There are many other possibilities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are <b>sure</b> that the venue will have an internet connection, why not
  embed a YouTube video.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DISPLAYING_EXISTING_WEB_PAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#DISPLAYING_EXISTING_WEB_PAGES">DISPLAYING
  EXISTING WEB PAGES</a></h2>
Obviously you could just have an HTML file that contains a redirect to the
  public web page:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0; url=http://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
However if you want your talk to work offline, then it's better to download the
  web page in advance, eg. using Firefox's &quot;Save Page As -&gt; Web Page,
  complete&quot; feature, into the talk directory, then either rename or make a
  symbolic link to the slide name:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ln -s &quot;haXe - Welcome to haXe.html&quot; 0010-haxe-homepage.html
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TIPS_FOR_WRITING_SHELL_SCRIPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#TIPS_FOR_WRITING_SHELL_SCRIPTS">TIPS
  FOR WRITING SHELL SCRIPTS</a></h2>
Make sure each &quot;*.sh&quot; or &quot;*.term&quot; file you write is
  executable, otherwise Tech Talk PSE won't be able to run it. (The program
  gives a warning if you forget this).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The difference between &quot;*.sh&quot; (shell script) and &quot;*.term&quot; (a
  terminal script) is that a shell script runs any commands, usually graphical
  commands, whereas a terminal script runs in a full screen terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A good idea is to start each script by sourcing some common functions. All my
  scripts start with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 #!/bin/bash -
 source functions
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where &quot;functions&quot; is another file (ignored by Tech Talk PSE) which
  contains common functions for setting shell history and starting a terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In &quot;functions&quot;, I have:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 # -*- shell-script -*-
 
 # Place any local environment variables required in 'local'.
 if [ -f local ]; then source local; fi
 
 export PS1=&quot;$ &quot;
 
 export HISTFILE=$talkdir/history
 
 rm -f $HISTFILE
 touch $HISTFILE
 
 add_history ()
 {
     echo &quot;$@&quot; &gt;&gt; $HISTFILE
 }
 
 terminal ()
 {
     # Make $HISTFILE unwritable so the shell won't update it
     # when it exits.
     chmod -w $HISTFILE
 
     # Execute a shell.
     bash --norc &quot;$@&quot;
 }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
By initializing the shell history, during your talk you can rapidly recall
  commands to start parts of the demonstration just by hitting the Up arrow. A
  complete terminal script from one of my talks would look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 #!/bin/bash -
 source functions
 add_history guestfish -i debian.img
 terminal
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is just a starting point for your own scripts.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REFERENCE"><a class="selflink" href="#REFERENCE">REFERENCE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ORDER_OF_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#ORDER_OF_FILES">ORDER
  OF FILES</a></h2>
Tech Talk PSE displays the slides in the directory in lexicographic order (the
  same order as &quot;LANG=C ls -1&quot;). Only files matching the following
  regexp are considered:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ^(\d+)(?:-.*)\.(html|sh|term)$
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For future compatibility, you should ensure that every slide has a unique
  numeric part (ie. <i>don't</i> have &quot;0010-aaa.html&quot; and
  &quot;0010-bbb.html&quot;). This is because in future we want to have the
  ability to display multiple files side by side.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also for future compatibility, <i>don't</i> use file names that have an
  uppercase letter immediately after the numeric part. This is because in future
  we want to allow placement hints using filenames like
  &quot;0010L-on-the-left.html&quot; and &quot;0010R-on-the-right.html&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BASE_URL_AND_CURRENT_DIRECTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#BASE_URL_AND_CURRENT_DIRECTORY">BASE
  URL AND CURRENT DIRECTORY</a></h2>
The base URL is set to the be the directory containing the talk files. Thus you
  should use relative paths, eg:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;img src=&quot;fig1.gif&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also place assets into subdirectories, because subdirectories are
  ignored by Tech Talk PSE, eg:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;img src=&quot;images/fig1.gif&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running shell scripts, the current directory is also set to be the
  directory containing the talk files, so the same rules about using relative
  paths apply there too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The environment variable $talkdir is exported to scripts and it contains the
  absolute path of the directory containing the talk files. When a script is
  run, the current directory is the same as $talkdir, but if your script changes
  directory (eg. into a subdirectory containing supporting files) then it can be
  useful to use $talkdir to refer back to the original directory.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHAT_MAKES_A_GOOD_TALK"><a class="selflink" href="#WHAT_MAKES_A_GOOD_TALK">WHAT
  MAKES A GOOD TALK</a></h1>
I like what Edward Tufte writes, for example his evisceration of PowerPoint use
  at NASA here:
  &lt;http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
However it is sometimes hard to translate his ideas into clear presentations,
  and not all of that is the fault of the tools. Here are my thoughts and rules
  on how to deliver a good talk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>First, most important rule:</b> Before you start drawing any slides at all,
  write your talk as a short essay.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the number one mistake that presenters make, and it is partly a tool
  fault, because PowerPoint, OpenOffice, even Tech Talk PSE, all open up on an
  initial blank slide, inviting you to write a title and some bullet points. If
  you start that way, you will end up using the program as a kind of clumsy
  outlining tool, and then reading that outline to your audience. That's boring
  and a waste of time for you and your audience. (It would be quicker for them
  just to download the talk and read it at home).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Secondly:</b> How long do you want to spend preparing the talk? A good talk,
  with a sound essay behind it, well thought out diagrams and figures, and
  interesting demonstrations, takes many hours to prepare. How many hours? I
  would suggest thinking about how many hours of effort your audience are
  putting in. Even just 20 people sitting there for half an hour is 10 man-hours
  of attention, and that is a very small talk, and doesn't include all the extra
  time and hassle that it took to get them all in one place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I don't think you can get away with spending less than two full days preparing a
  talk, if you want to master the topic and draw up accurate slides. Steve Jobs
  was reputed to spend weeks preparing his annual sales talk to the Apple
  faithful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Thirdly:</b> Now that you're going to write your talk as an essay, what
  should go in the slides? I would say that you should consider delivering the
  essay, <i>not</i> the slides, to people who don't make the talk. An essay can
  be turned into an article or blog posting, whereas even
  &quot;read-out-the-bullet-point&quot; slides have a low information density,
  large size, and end-user compatibility problems (*.pptx anyone?).
<div class="Pp"></div>
What, then, goes on the slides? Anything you cannot just say: diagrams, graphs,
  videos, animations, and of course (only with Tech Talk PSE!) demonstrations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Lastly:</b> Once you've got your talk as an essay and slides, practice,
  practice and practice again. Deliver the talk to yourself in the mirror, to
  your colleagues. Practice going backwards and forwards through the slides,
  using your actual laptop and the software so you know what to click and what
  keys to press. Partly memorize what you are going to say (but use short notes
  written on paper if you need to).
