<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dsync is Dovecot&rsquo;s mailbox synchronization utility. It
can be used for several different use cases: Two-way
synchronization of mailboxes, creating backups of mails, and
convert <br>
mailboxes from/to different mailbox formats. All of these
can be used within the same server or between different
servers (via ssh(1) or tcp connections). Remote mailboxes
can <br>
be accessed also via IMAP protocol, which allows using dsync
for mailbox migration purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run dsync in one of
three modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; doveadm backup
performs one-way synchronization. If there are any changes
in the destination they will be deleted, so the destination
will look exactly like the <br>
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; doveadm sync
performs two-way synchronization. It merges all changes
without losing anything. Both the mailboxes will end up
looking identical after the synchro&acirc; <br>
nization is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; doveadm sync -1
performs one-way synchronization, but it merges the changes
in destination without deleting anything. This doesn&rsquo;t
currently work perfectly, so its <br>
use should be limited. Its main purpose is that during
mailbox migration you can run doveadm backup multiple times,
then switch mails to be delivered to the new <br>
mailbox and run doveadm sync -1 once more to transfer any
last new mails from the old mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The one-way algorithm is the
same as two-way dsync algorithm except the source account is
not modified. It fetches the message&rsquo;s GUID (Global
UID), which is used to <br>
identify any conflicting UIDs in messages. As long as the
source and destination side has matching UID&lt;-&gt;GUID
mapping, those emails are assumed to be synced cor&acirc;
<br>
rectly. Only after the first mismatch will changes
begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: Source mailbox has
messages UID 1..5; source mailbox is sync&rsquo;d using
doveadm backup to the destination. Subsequently, UID 6 is
delivered to the source <br>
mailbox and UID 1 is expunged from the destination mailbox.
In this example, UID 1 is kept removed (in destination)
because UID 1..5 have identical Date+Message-ID <br>
headers. UID 6 is not seen in destination so it&rsquo;s
copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both source and destination
have UID 6, but the messages are different, the headers
don&rsquo;t match and both the messages are kept in the
destination but they&rsquo;re <br>
given new UIDs 7 and 8 just to be sure any client
didn&rsquo;t get confused about what UID 11 actually was.
Thus, one-way sync begins to quickly diverge from the source
<br>
mailbox once changes start to occur on either side; one-way
sync should therefore normally only be used within a short
period of time after a doveadm backup or <br>
doveadm sync command was used to synchronize the
mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also three different
synchronization algorithms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Full
synchronization (-f parameter) scans through all the
messages in all the mailboxes. This guarantees that
everything will be synchronized, but it&rsquo;s
unnecessar&acirc; <br>
ily slow for incremental synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fast
synchronization (default) first attempts to find mailboxes
that have changed, and synchronize only those. This is done
by checking the mailboxes&rsquo; metadata <br>
(NEXTUID and HIGHESTMODSEQ). Usually this works fine,
especially with one-way synchronization, but if both sides
do exactly the same number of changes, the meta&acirc; <br>
data may end up containing the same values even if the
changes were different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stateful
synchronization (-s parameter) is the most efficient way to
synchronize mailboxes. It relies on having the earlier dsync
run&rsquo;s state saved somewhere and <br>
being passed to the next dsync run. Based on this state
dsync can send only the changes that happened after the
previous dsync run. As long as the state or the <br>
mailboxes aren&rsquo;t corrupted this algorithm should work
perfectly. The replicator process uses this internally to
perform most of the synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syncing is done as perfectly
as possible: an IMAP or a POP3 client shouldn&rsquo;t be
able to notice any differences between the two mailboxes.
Two-way syncing means that it&rsquo;s <br>
safe to do any kind of modifications in both sides, and
dsync will merge the changes without losing any changes done
on either side. This is possible because dsync can access
<br>
Dovecot&rsquo;s index logs that keep track of changes.
It&rsquo;s of course possible to have conflicts during
merging, these are resolved in a safe way. See the dsync
design document for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync uses the same
configuration files as the rest of Dovecot (via doveconf(1)
binary). The entire configuration can be changed by giving
-c parameter to another configuration <br>
file, or using -o parameter to override specific settings.
When executing a remote dsync program it works the same way:
it uses its own local configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync can be run completely
standalone. It doesn&rsquo;t require any Dovecot server
processes to be running, except when using -u parameter to
do a userdb lookup from auth process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync can sync either one or
multiple users using the -u or -A parameters. For continuous
replication you can use the Dovecot replicator process,
which automatically runs dsync <br>
whenever messages have changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enables verbosity and debug
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o setting=value <br>
Overrides the configuration setting from
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and from the userdb with the given
value. In order to override multiple settings, the -o option
may be <br>
specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enables verbosity, including
progress counter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command specific options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Do one-way synchronization
instead of two-way synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A If the -A option is present,
the command will be performed for all users. Using this
option in combination with system users from userdb { driver
= passwd } is not recom&acirc; <br>
mended, because it contains also users with a lower UID than
the one configured with the first_valid_uid setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the SQL userdb module is
used make sure that the iterate_query setting in
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your database
layout. When using the LDAP userdb <br>
module, make sure that the iterate_attrs and iterate_filter
settings in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your
LDAP schema. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to <br>
iterate over all users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F file <br>
Execute the command for all the users in the file. This is
similar to the -A option, but instead of getting the list of
users from the userdb, they are read from the <br>
given file. The file contains one username per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Synchronize all the available
namespaces. By default only namespaces that don&rsquo;t have
explicit location setting are synchronized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Run a doveadm-purge(1) for
the destination (remote) storage after synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Do a reverse sync. Normally,
messages would be pushed from the local system to the
destination (remote). This option reverses the flow, and
will instead pull messages from <br>
the remote to the local storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S socket_path <br>
The option&rsquo;s argument is either an absolute path to a
local UNIX domain socket, or a hostname and port
(hostname:port), in order to connect a remote host via a TCP
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows an administrator to
execute doveadm(1) mail commands through the given
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T secs <br>
Specify the time in seconds, how long doveadm(1) should wait
for stalled I/O operations. The default timeout is 600
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U This is used internally by
replicator to have dsync notify it when the synchronization
is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Use the default destination,
which is looked up from the mail_replica userdb extra
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g mailbox_guid <br>
Same as -m, but find the mailbox to be synchronized by its
GUID instead of by name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l secs <br>
Lock the dsync for this user. Wait for maximum secs before
giving up. This parameter should be used to avoid broken
synchronization if it&rsquo;s possible that dsync is being
<br>
run concurrently for the same user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mailbox <br>
Synchronize only this mailbox name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n namespace <br>
Synchronize only the specified namespace. This parameter can
be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rawlog_path <br>
Running dsync remotely, write the remote input/output
traffic to the specified log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s previous_state <br>
Use stateful synchronization. If the previous state is
unknown, use an empty string. The new state is always
printed to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user/mask <br>
Run the command only for the given user. It&rsquo;s also
possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;?&rsquo;
wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). <br>
When neither the -A option, nor the -F file option, nor the
-u user was specified, the command will be executed with the
environment of the currently logged in user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x mailbox_mask <br>
Exclude the specified mailbox name/mask. The mask may
contain &quot;?&quot; and &quot;*&quot; wildcards. This
parameter can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
destination <br>
This argument specifies the synchronized destination. It can
be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">location <br>
Same as mail_location setting, e.g. maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote:login@host <br>
Uses dsync_remote_cmd setting to connect to the remote host
(usually via ssh)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remoteprefix:login@host <br>
This is the same as remote, except &quot;user@domain0 is
sent before dsync protocol starts. This allows implementing
a trusted wrapper script that runs doveadm <br>
dsync-server by reading the username from the first
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp:host[:port] <br>
Connects to remote doveadm server via TCP. The default port
is specified by doveadm_port setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcps:host[:port] <br>
This is the same as tcp, but with SSL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
dsync will exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Synchronization was done
perfectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Synchronization was done
without errors, but some changes couldn&rsquo;t be done, so
the mailboxes aren&rsquo;t perfectly synchronized. Running
dsync again usually fixes this. Typically <br>
this occurs for message modification sequences with newly
created mailboxes. It can also occur if one of the mailboxes
change during the syncing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1, &gt;2 <br>
Synchronization failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
SYNCHRONIZATION <br>
Synchronize mailboxes with a remote server. Any errors are
written to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doveadm sync -u
username@example.com remote:server-replica.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need more complex
parameters to ssh, you can use e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doveadm sync -u
username@example.com ssh -i id_dsa.dovecot
mailuser@example.com doveadm dsync-server -u
username@example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERTING <br>
Assuming that the mail_location setting in
/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf is set to: mail_location =
mdbox:~/mdbox, a logged in system user may convert her/his
mails from its <br>
Maildir in her/his home directory to the mdbox mailbox
format. The user has to execute the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doveadm sync
maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to do this without
any downtime, you can do the conversion one user at a time.
Initially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configuration
uses mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set up the
possibility of doing per-user mail location using userdb
extra fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then for each user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Run doveadm sync once to do
the initial conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Run doveadm sync again,
because the initial conversion could have taken a while and
new changes could have occurred during it. This second time
only applies changes, so <br>
it should be fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Update mail extra field in
userdb to mdbox:~/mdbox. If you&rsquo;re using auth cache,
you need to flush it, e.g. doveadm auth cache flush.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Wait for a few seconds and
then kill (doveadm kick) the user&rsquo;s all existing imap
and pop3 sessions (that are still using maildir).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Run doveadm sync once more to
apply final changes that were possibly done. After this
there should be no changes to Maildir, because the
user&rsquo;s mail location has been <br>
changed and all existing processes using it have been
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once all users have been
converted, you can set the default mail_location to mdbox
and remove the per-user mail locations from userdb.</p>
