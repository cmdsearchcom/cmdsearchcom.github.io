<p>DJVU(1) DjVuLibre-3.5 DJVU(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
DjVu - DjVu and DjVuLibre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Although the Internet has given us a worldwide
infrastructure on which to build the universal library, much
of the world knowledge, history, and literature is still
trapped on <br>
paper in the basements of the world&rsquo;s traditional
libraries. Many libraries and content owners are in the
process of digitizing their collections. While many such
efforts <br>
involve the painstaking process of converting paper
documents to computer-friendly form, such as SGML based
formats, the high cost of such conversions limits their
extent. Scan&acirc; <br>
ning documents, and distributing the resulting images
electronically is not only considerably cheaper, but also
more faithful to the original document because it preserves
its <br>
visual aspect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite the quickly improving
speed of network connections and computers, the number of
scanned document images accessible on the Web today is
relatively small. There are several <br>
reasons for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first reason is the
relatively high cost of scanning anything else but unbound
sheets in black and white. This problem is slowly going away
with the appearance of fast and <br>
low-cost color scanners with sheet feeders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second reason is that
long-established image compression standards and file
formats have proved inadequate for distributing scanned
documents at high resolution, particularly <br>
color documents. Not only are the file sizes and download
times impractical, the decoding and rendering times are also
prohibitive. A typical magazine page scanned in color at
<br>
100 dpi in JPEG would typically occupy 100 KB to 200 KB ,
but the text would be hardly readable: insufficient for
screen viewing and totally unacceptable for printing. The
same <br>
page at 300 dpi would have sufficient quality for viewing
and printing, but the file size would be 300 KB to 1000 KB
at best, which is impractical for remote access. Another
<br>
major problem is that a fully decoded 300 dpi color images
of a letter-size page occupies 24 MB of memory and easily
causes disk swapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third reason is that digital
documents are more than just a collection of individual page
images. Pages in a scanned documents have a natural serial
order. Special provision <br>
must be made to ensure that flipping pages be instantaneous
and effortless so as to maintain a good user experience.
Even more important, most existing document formats force
<br>
users to download the entire document first before
displaying a chosen page. However, users often want to jump
to individual pages of the document without waiting for the
entire <br>
document to download. Efficient browsing requires efficient
random page access, fast sequential page flipping, and quick
rendering. This can be achieved with a combination of <br>
advanced compression, pre-fetching, pre-decoding, caching,
and progressive rendering. DjVu decomposes each page into
multiple components (text, backgrounds, images, libraries of
<br>
common shapes...) that may be shared by several pages and
downloaded on demand. All these requirements call for a very
sophisticated but parsimonious control mechanism to
han&acirc; <br>
dle on-demand downloading, pre-fetching, decoding, caching,
and progressive rendering of the page images. What is being
considered here is not just a document image compression
<br>
technique, but a whole platform for document delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DjVu is an image compression
technique, a document format, and a software platform for
delivering documents images over the Internet that fulfills
the above requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVU IMAGE COMPRESSION <br>
The DjVu image compression is based on three
technologies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DjVuPhoto <br>
DjVuPhoto, also known as IW44, is a wavelet-based
continuous-tone image compression technique with progressive
decoding/rendering. It is best used for encoding
photographic <br>
images in colors or in shades of gray. Images are typically
half the size as JPEG for the same distortion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DjVuBitonal <br>
DjVuBitonal, also known as JB2, is a bitonal image
compression that takes advantage of repetitions of nearly
identical shapes on the page (such as characters) to
efficiently com&acirc; <br>
press text images. It is best used to compress black and
white images representing text and simple drawings. A
typical 300 dpi page in DjVuBitonal occupies 5 to 25 KB (3
to 8 <br>
times better than TIFF-G4 or PDF ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DjVuDocument <br>
DjVuDocument is a compression technique specifically
designed for color digital documents images containing both
pictures and text, such as a page of a magazine.
DjVuDocument <br>
represents images into separately compressed layers. The
foreground layer is usually compressed with DjVu Bitonal and
contains the text and drawings. The background layer is <br>
usually compressed with DjVuPhoto and contains the
background texture and the pictures at lower resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVU DOCUMENT DELIVERY PLATFORM
<br>
The DjVu technology is designed from the ground up to
support the efficient delivery of digital documents over the
Internet. It provides various ways to deal with multi-page
<br>
documents, and various ways to enrich the content with
hyper-links, meta-data, searchable text, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIME types <br>
The DjVu format has an official MIME type of image/vnd.djvu,
which is the preferred content-type to be given by http
servers for DjVu files. Unofficial mime types used
histori&acirc; <br>
cally are image/x.djvu and image/x-djvu, which may still be
encountered. Ideally, clients should be configured to handle
all three. (For web server configuration help, see <br>

http://www.djvuzone.org/support/tutorial/chapter-authoring1.html.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bundled multi-page documents
<br>
Bundled multi-page DjVu document uses a single file to
represent the entire document. This single file contains all
the pages as well as ancillary information (e.g. the page
<br>
directory, data shared by several pages, thumbnails, etc.).
Using a single file format is very convenient for storing
documents or for sending email attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you type the URL of a
multi-page document, the DjVu browser plugin starts
downloading the whole file, but displays the first page as
soon as it is available. You can imme&acirc; <br>
diately navigate to other pages using the DjVu toolbar.
Suppose however that the document is stored on a remote web
server. You can easily access the first page and see that
<br>
this is not the document you wanted. Although you will never
display the other pages the browser is transferring data for
these pages and is wasting the bandwidth of your server <br>
(and the bandwidth of the Internet too). You could also see
the summary of the document on the first page and jump to
page 100. But page 100 cannot be displayed until data for
<br>
pages 1 to 99 has been received. You may have to wait for
the transmission of unnecessary page data. This second
problem (the unnecessary wait) can be solved using the
&lsquo;&lsquo;byte <br>
serving&rsquo;&rsquo; options of the HTTP/1.1 protocol. This
option has to be supported by the web server, the proxies,
the caches and the browser. Byte serving however does not
solve the <br>
first problem (the waste of bandwidth).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indirect multi-page documents
<br>
Indirect multi-page DjVu documents solve both problems. An
indirect multi-page DjVu document is composed of several
files. The main file is named the index file. You can <br>
browse a document using the URL of the index file, just like
you do with a bundled multi-page document. The index file
however is very small. It simply contains the document <br>
directory and the URLs of secondary files containing the
page data. When you browse an indirect multi-page document,
the browser only accesses data for the pages you are
view&acirc; <br>
ing. This can be done at a reasonable speed because the
browser maintains a cache of pages and sometimes pre-fetches
a few pages ahead of the current page. This model uses the
<br>
web serving bandwidth much more effectively. It also
eliminates unnecessary delays when jumping ahead to pages
located anywhere in a long document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annotations <br>
Every DjVu image optionally includes so-called annotation
chunks. The annotation chunk is often used to define
hyper-links to other document pages or to arbitrary web
pages. <br>
Annotation chunks can also be used for other purposes such
as setting the initial viewing mode of a page, defining
highlighted zones, or storing arbitrary meta-data about the
<br>
page or the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hidden text <br>
Every DjVu image optionally includes a hidden text layer
that associated graphical features with the corresponding
text. The hidden text layer is usually generated by running
an <br>
Optical Character Recognition software. This textual
information provides for indexing DjVu documents and
copying/pasting text from DjVu page images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thumbnails <br>
DjVu documents sometimes contain pre-computed page
thumbnails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outline <br>
DjVu documents sometimes contain a navigation chunk
containing an outline, that is, a hierarchical table of
contents with pointers to the corresponding document
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVUZONE AND DJVULIBRE <br>
The DjVu technology was initially created by a few
researchers in AT&amp;T Labs between 1995 and 1999.
Lizardtech, Inc. ( http://www.lizardtech.com ) then obtained
a commercial <br>
license from AT&amp;T and continued the development. They
have now a variety of solutions for producing and
distributing documents using the DjVu technology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DjVuZone web site (
http://www.djvuzone.org ) is managed by the few AT&amp;T
Labs researchers who created the DjVu technology in the
first place. We promote the DjVu technology <br>
by providing an independent source of information about
DjVu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Understanding how little room
there is for a proprietary document format, Lizardtech
released the DjVu Reference Library under the GNU Public
License in December 2000. This <br>
library entirely defines the compression format and the
elementary codecs. Six month later, Lizardtech released an
updated DjVu Reference Library as well as the source code of
<br>
the Unix viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two releases form the
basis of our initial DjVuLibre software. We modified the
build system to comply with the expectations of the open
source community. Various bugs and <br>
portability issues have been fixed. We also tried to make it
simpler to use and install, while preserving the essential
structure of the Lizardtech releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DjVuLibre software contains
the following components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bzz(1) A general purpose
compression command line program. Many internal DjVu data
structures are compressed using this technique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c44(1) A DjVuPhoto command line
encoder. This state-of-the-art wavelet compressor produces
DjVuPhoto images from PPM or JPEG images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cjb2(1) <br>
A DjVuBitonal command line encoder. This
soft-pattern-matching compressor produces DjVuBitonal images
from PBM images. It can encode images without loss, or
introduce <br>
small changes in order to improve the compression ratio. The
lossless encoding mode is competitive with that of the
Lizardtech commercial encoders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpaldjvu(1) <br>
A DjVuDocument command line encoder for images with few
colors. This encoder is well suited to compressing images
with a small number of distinct colors (e.g. screen- <br>
shots). The dominant color is encoded by the background
layer. The other colors are encoded by the foreground
layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csepdjvu(1) <br>
A DjVuDocument command line encoder for separated images.
This encoder takes a file containing pre-segmented
foreground and background images and produces a DjVuDocument
<br>
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ddjvu(1) <br>
A command line decoder for DjVu images. This program
produces a PNM image representing any segment of any page of
a DjVu document at any resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djview(1) <br>
A stand-alone viewer for DjVu images. This sophisticated
viewer displays DjVu documents. It implements document
navigation as well as fast zooming and panning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nsdejavu(1) <br>
A web browser plugin for viewing DjVu images. This small
plugin allows for viewing DjVu documents from web browsers.
It internally uses djview to perform the actual <br>
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvups(1) <br>
A command line tool for converting DjVu documents into
PostScript .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvm(1) <br>
A command line tool for manipulating bundled multi-page DjVu
documents. This program is often used to collect individual
pages and produce a bundled document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvmcvt(1) <br>
A command line tool for converting bundled documents to
indirect documents and conversely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvused(1) <br>
A powerful command line tool for manipulating multi-page
documents, creating or editing annotation chunks, creating
or editing hidden text layers, pre-computing thumbnail <br>
images, and more...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvutxt(1) <br>
A command line tool to extract the hidden text from DjVu
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvudump(1) <br>
A command line tool for inspecting DjVu files and displaying
their internal structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvuextract(1) <br>
A command line tool for dis-assembling DjVu image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvumake(1) <br>
A command line tool for assembling DjVu image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvuserve(1) <br>
A CGI program for generating indirect multi-page DjVu
documents on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djvutoxml(1), djvuxmlparser(1)
<br>
Command line tools to edit DjVu metadata as XML files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DJVU ENCODERS AND ANY2DJVU <br>
DjVuLibre comes with a variety of specialized encoders,
c44(1) for photographic images, cjb2(1) for bitonal images,
and cpaldjvu(1) for images with few distinct colors.
Although <br>
these encoders perform well in their specialized domain,
they cannot handle complex tasks involving segmentation and
multipage encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Lizardtech commercial
products (see http://www.lizardtech.com/solutions/document)
can perform these complex encoding tasks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another solution is provided by
the compression server at (http://any2djvu.djvuzone.org).
This machine uses pre-lizardtech prototype encoders from
AT&amp;T Labs and performs almost <br>
as well as the commercial Lizardtech encoders. Please note
that the Any2DjVu compression server comes with no
guarantee, that nothing is done to ensure that your
documents will <br>
remain confidential, and that there is only one computer
working for the whole planet.</p>
