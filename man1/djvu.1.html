DjVu - DjVu and DjVuLibre.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
Although the Internet has given us a worldwide infrastructure on which to build
  the universal library, much of the world knowledge, history, and literature is
  still trapped on paper in the basements of the world's traditional libraries.
  Many libraries and content owners are in the process of digitizing their
  collections. While many such efforts involve the painstaking process of
  converting paper documents to computer-friendly form, such as
  <small>SGML</small> based formats, the high cost of such conversions limits
  their extent. Scanning documents, and distributing the resulting images
  electronically is not only considerably cheaper, but also more faithful to the
  original document because it preserves its visual aspect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Despite the quickly improving speed of network connections and computers, the
  number of scanned document images accessible on the Web today is relatively
  small. There are several reasons for this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first reason is the relatively high cost of scanning anything else but
  unbound sheets in black and white. This problem is slowly going away with the
  appearance of fast and low-cost color scanners with sheet feeders.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second reason is that long-established image compression standards and file
  formats have proved inadequate for distributing scanned documents at high
  resolution, particularly color documents. Not only are the file sizes and
  download times impractical, the decoding and rendering times are also
  prohibitive. A typical magazine page scanned in color at 100 dpi in
  <small>JPEG</small> would typically occupy 100 <small>KB</small> to 200
  <small>KB</small> , but the text would be hardly readable: insufficient for
  screen viewing and totally unacceptable for printing. The same page at 300 dpi
  would have sufficient quality for viewing and printing, but the file size
  would be 300 <small>KB</small> to 1000 <small>KB</small> at best, which is
  impractical for remote access. Another major problem is that a fully decoded
  300 dpi color images of a letter-size page occupies 24 <small>MB</small> of
  memory and easily causes disk swapping.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third reason is that digital documents are more than just a collection of
  individual page images. Pages in a scanned documents have a natural serial
  order. Special provision must be made to ensure that flipping pages be
  instantaneous and effortless so as to maintain a good user experience. Even
  more important, most existing document formats force users to download the
  entire document first before displaying a chosen page. However, users often
  want to jump to individual pages of the document without waiting for the
  entire document to download. Efficient browsing requires efficient random page
  access, fast sequential page flipping, and quick rendering. This can be
  achieved with a combination of advanced compression, pre-fetching,
  pre-decoding, caching, and progressive rendering. DjVu decomposes each page
  into multiple components (text, backgrounds, images, libraries of common
  shapes...) that may be shared by several pages and downloaded on demand. All
  these requirements call for a very sophisticated but parsimonious control
  mechanism to handle on-demand downloading, pre-fetching, decoding, caching,
  and progressive rendering of the page images. What is being considered here is
  not just a document image compression technique, but a whole platform for
  document delivery.
<div class="Pp"></div>
DjVu is an image compression technique, a document format, and a software
  platform for delivering documents images over the Internet that fulfills the
  above requirements.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DJVU_IMAGE_COMPRESSION"><a class="selflink" href="#DJVU_IMAGE_COMPRESSION">DJVU
  IMAGE COMPRESSION</a></h1>
The DjVu image compression is based on three technologies:
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DjVuPhoto"><a class="selflink" href="#DjVuPhoto">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;DjVuPhoto</a></h1>
DjVuPhoto, also known as <small>IW44,</small> is a wavelet-based continuous-tone
  image compression technique with progressive decoding/rendering. It is best
  used for encoding photographic images in colors or in shades of gray. Images
  are typically half the size as <small>JPEG</small> for the same distortion.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DjVuBitonal"><a class="selflink" href="#DjVuBitonal">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;DjVuBitonal</a></h1>
DjVuBitonal, also known as <small>JB2,</small> is a bitonal image compression
  that takes advantage of repetitions of nearly identical shapes on the page
  (such as characters) to efficiently compress text images. It is best used to
  compress black and white images representing text and simple drawings. A
  typical 300 dpi page in DjVuBitonal occupies 5 to 25 <small>KB</small> (3 to 8
  times better than <small>TIFF-G4</small> or <small>PDF</small> ).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DjVuDocument"><a class="selflink" href="#DjVuDocument">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;DjVuDocument</a></h1>
DjVuDocument is a compression technique specifically designed for color digital
  documents images containing both pictures and text, such as a page of a
  magazine. DjVuDocument represents images into separately compressed layers.
  The foreground layer is usually compressed with DjVu Bitonal and contains the
  text and drawings. The background layer is usually compressed with DjVuPhoto
  and contains the background texture and the pictures at lower resolution.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DJVU_DOCUMENT_DELIVERY_PLATFORM"><a class="selflink" href="#DJVU_DOCUMENT_DELIVERY_PLATFORM">DJVU
  DOCUMENT DELIVERY PLATFORM</a></h1>
The DjVu technology is designed from the ground up to support the efficient
  delivery of digital documents over the Internet. It provides various ways to
  deal with multi-page documents, and various ways to enrich the content with
  hyper-links, meta-data, searchable text, etc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MIME_types"><a class="selflink" href="#MIME_types">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;MIME
  types</a></h1>
The DjVu format has an official MIME type of <b>image/vnd.djvu</b>, which is the
  preferred content-type to be given by http servers for DjVu files. Unofficial
  mime types used historically are <b>image/x.djvu</b> and <b>image/x-djvu</b>,
  which may still be encountered. Ideally, clients should be configured to
  handle all three. (For web server configuration help, see
  <b>http://www.djvuzone.org/support/tutorial/chapter-authoring1.html</b>.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Bundled_multi-page_documents"><a class="selflink" href="#Bundled_multi-page_documents">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Bundled
  multi-page documents</a></h1>
Bundled multi-page DjVu document uses a single file to represent the entire
  document. This single file contains all the pages as well as ancillary
  information (e.g. the page directory, data shared by several pages,
  thumbnails, etc.). Using a single file format is very convenient for storing
  documents or for sending email attachments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you type the <small>URL</small> of a multi-page document, the DjVu browser
  plugin starts downloading the whole file, but displays the first page as soon
  as it is available. You can immediately navigate to other pages using the DjVu
  toolbar. Suppose however that the document is stored on a remote web server.
  You can easily access the first page and see that this is not the document you
  wanted. Although you will never display the other pages the browser is
  transferring data for these pages and is wasting the bandwidth of your server
  (and the bandwidth of the Internet too). You could also see the summary of the
  document on the first page and jump to page 100. But page 100 cannot be
  displayed until data for pages 1 to 99 has been received. You may have to wait
  for the transmission of unnecessary page data. This second problem (the
  unnecessary wait) can be solved using the ``byte serving'' options of the
  <small>HTTP/1.1</small> protocol. This option has to be supported by the web
  server, the proxies, the caches and the browser. Byte serving however does not
  solve the first problem (the waste of bandwidth).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Indirect_multi-page_documents"><a class="selflink" href="#Indirect_multi-page_documents">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Indirect
  multi-page documents</a></h1>
Indirect multi-page DjVu documents solve both problems. An indirect multi-page
  DjVu document is composed of several files. The main file is named the index
  file. You can browse a document using the <small>URL</small> of the index
  file, just like you do with a bundled multi-page document. The index file
  however is very small. It simply contains the document directory and the
  <small>URLs</small> of secondary files containing the page data. When you
  browse an indirect multi-page document, the browser only accesses data for the
  pages you are viewing. This can be done at a reasonable speed because the
  browser maintains a cache of pages and sometimes pre-fetches a few pages ahead
  of the current page. This model uses the web serving bandwidth much more
  effectively. It also eliminates unnecessary delays when jumping ahead to pages
  located anywhere in a long document.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Annotations"><a class="selflink" href="#Annotations">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Annotations</a></h1>
Every DjVu image optionally includes so-called annotation chunks. The annotation
  chunk is often used to define hyper-links to other document pages or to
  arbitrary web pages. Annotation chunks can also be used for other purposes
  such as setting the initial viewing mode of a page, defining highlighted
  zones, or storing arbitrary meta-data about the page or the document.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Hidden_text"><a class="selflink" href="#Hidden_text">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Hidden
  text</a></h1>
Every DjVu image optionally includes a hidden text layer that associated
  graphical features with the corresponding text. The hidden text layer is
  usually generated by running an Optical Character Recognition software. This
  textual information provides for indexing DjVu documents and copying/pasting
  text from DjVu page images.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Thumbnails"><a class="selflink" href="#Thumbnails">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Thumbnails</a></h1>
DjVu documents sometimes contain pre-computed page thumbnails.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Outline"><a class="selflink" href="#Outline">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Outline</a></h1>
DjVu documents sometimes contain a navigation chunk containing an outline, that
  is, a hierarchical table of contents with pointers to the corresponding
  document pages.

  AND DJVULIBRE</a></h1>
The DjVu technology was initially created by a few researchers in AT&amp;T Labs
  between 1995 and 1999. Lizardtech, Inc. ( <b>http://www.lizardtech.com</b> )
  then obtained a commercial license from AT&amp;T and continued the
  development. They have now a variety of solutions for producing and
  distributing documents using the DjVu technology.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The DjVuZone web site ( <b>http://www.djvuzone.org</b> ) is managed by the few
  AT&amp;T Labs researchers who created the DjVu technology in the first place.
  We promote the DjVu technology by providing an independent source of
  information about DjVu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Understanding how little room there is for a proprietary document format,
  Lizardtech released the DjVu Reference Library under the <small>GNU</small>
  Public License in December 2000. This library entirely defines the compression
  format and the elementary codecs. Six month later, Lizardtech released an
  updated DjVu Reference Library as well as the source code of the Unix viewer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These two releases form the basis of our initial DjVuLibre software. We modified
  the build system to comply with the expectations of the open source community.
  Various bugs and portability issues have been fixed. We also tried to make it
  simpler to use and install, while preserving the essential structure of the
  Lizardtech releases.

DjVuLibre comes with a variety of specialized encoders, <b>c44</b>(1) for
  photographic images, <b>cjb2</b>(1) for bitonal images, and <b>cpaldjvu</b>(1)
  for images with few distinct colors. Although these encoders perform well in
  their specialized domain, they cannot handle complex tasks involving
  segmentation and multipage encoding.
