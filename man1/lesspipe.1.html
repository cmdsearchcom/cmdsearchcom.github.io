<p>LESSOPEN(1) General Commands Manual LESSOPEN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lessfile, lesspipe - &quot;input preprocessor&quot; for
less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lessfile, lesspipe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the lessfile, and
lesspipe commands. This manual page was written for the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the input preprocessor
scripts <br>
are provided by Debian GNU/Linux and are not part of the
original program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lessfile and lesspipe are
programs that can be used to modify the way the contents of
a file are displayed in less. What this means is that less
can automatically open up tar <br>
files, uncompress gzipped files, and even display something
reasonable for graphics files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lesspipe will toss the
contents/info on STDOUT and less will read them as they come
across. This means that you do not have to wait for the
decoding to finish before less shows <br>
you the file. This also means that you will get a
&rsquo;byte N&rsquo; instead of an N% as your file position.
You can seek to the end and back to get the N% but that
means you have to <br>
wait for the pipe to finish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lessfile will toss the
contents/info on a file which less will then read. After you
are done, lessfile will then delete the file. This means
that the process has to finish <br>
before you see it, but you get nice percentages (N%) up
front.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Just put one of the following two commands in your login
script (e.g. ~/.bash_profile):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &quot;$(lessfile)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &quot;$(lesspipe)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE TYPE RECOGNITION <br>
File types are recognized by their extensions. This is a
list of currently supported extensions (grouped by the
programs that handle them):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.a <br>
*.arj <br>
*.tar.bz2 <br>
*.bz <br>
*.bz2 <br>
*.deb, *.udeb, *.ddeb <br>
*.doc <br>
*.gif, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.pcd, *.png, *.tga, *.tiff, *.tif
<br>
*.iso, *.raw, *.bin <br>
*.lha, *.lzh <br>
*.tar.lz, *.tlz <br>
*.lz <br>
*.7z <br>
*.pdf <br>
*.rar, *.r[0-9][0-9] <br>
*.rpm <br>
*.tar.gz, *.tgz, *.tar.z, *.tar.dz <br>
*.gz, *.z, *.dz <br>
*.tar <br>
*.tar.xz, *.xz <br>
*.jar, *.war, *.xpi, *.zip <br>
*.zoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER DEFINED FILTERS <br>
It is possible to extend and overwrite the default lesspipe
and lessfile input processor if you have specialized
requirements. Create an executable program with the name
.less&acirc; <br>
filter and put it into your home directory. This can be a
shell script or a binary program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that this
program returns the correct exit code: return 0 if your
filter handles the input, return 1 if the standard
lesspipe/lessfile filter should handle the <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
*.extension) <br>
extension-handler &quot;$1&quot; <br>
;; <br>
*) <br>
# We don&rsquo;t handle this format. <br>
exit 1 <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># No further processing by
lesspipe necessary <br>
exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.lessfilter <br>
Executable file that can do user defined processing. See
section USER DEFINED FILTERS for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When trying to open compressed 0 byte files, less displays
the actual binary file contents. This is not a bug. less is
designed to do that (see manual page less(1), section <br>
INPUT PREPROCESSOR). This is the answer of Mark Nudelman
&lt;markn@greenwoodsoftware.com&gt;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;I recognized when I
designed it that a lesspipe filter cannot output an empty
file and have less display nothing in that case; it&rsquo;s
a side effect of using the &quot;no output&quot; <br>
case to mean &quot;the filter has nothing to do&quot;. It
could have been designed to have some other mechanism to
indicate &quot;nothing to do&quot;, but &quot;no
output&quot; seemed the simplest and <br>
most intuitive for lesspipe writers.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, less does not display
the contents file you want to view but output that is
produced by your login scripts (~/.bashrc or
~/.bash_profile). This happens because less <br>
uses your current shell to run the lesspipe filter. Bash
first looks for the variable $BASH_ENV in the environment
expands its value and uses the expanded value as the name of
a <br>
file to read and execute. If this file produces any output
less will display this. A way to solve this problem is to
put the following lines on the top of your login script that
<br>
produces output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ -z &quot;$PS1&quot; ]; then
<br>
exit <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tests whether the prompt
variable $PS1 is set and if it isn&rsquo;t (which is the
case for non-interactive shells) it will exit the
script.</p>
