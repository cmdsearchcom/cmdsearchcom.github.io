This manual page documents briefly the <i>lessfile</i>, and <i>lesspipe</i>
  commands. This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
  because the input preprocessor scripts are provided by Debian GNU/Linux and
  are not part of the original program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>lessfile</i> and <i>lesspipe</i> are programs that can be used to modify the
  way the contents of a file are displayed in <i>less.</i> What this means is
  that <i>less</i> can automatically open up tar files, uncompress gzipped
  files, and even display something reasonable for graphics files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>lesspipe</i> will toss the contents/info on STDOUT and <i>less</i> will read
  them as they come across. This means that you do not have to wait for the
  decoding to finish before less shows you the file. This also means that you
  will get a 'byte N' instead of an N% as your file position. You can seek to
  the end and back to get the N% but that means you have to wait for the pipe to
  finish.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>lessfile</i> will toss the contents/info on a file which <i>less</i> will
  then read. After you are done, <i>lessfile</i> will then delete the file. This
  means that the process has to finish before you see it, but you get nice
  percentages (N%) up front.

Just put one of the following two commands in your login script (e.g.
  ~/.bash_profile):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 eval &quot;$(lessfile)&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 eval &quot;$(lesspipe)&quot;

It is possible to extend and overwrite the default <i>lesspipe</i> and
  <i>lessfile</i> input processor if you have specialized requirements. Create
  an executable program with the name <i>.lessfilter</i> and put it into your
  home directory. This can be a shell script or a binary program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is important that this program returns the correct exit code: return 0 if
  your filter handles the input, return 1 if the standard
  <i>lesspipe/lessfile</i> filter should handle the input.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

Here is an example script:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #!/bin/sh
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 case &quot;$1&quot; in
<br/>
 *.extension)
<br/>
 extension-handler &quot;$1&quot;
<br/>
 ;;
<br/>
 *)
<br/>
 # We don't handle this format.
<br/>
 exit 1
<br/>
 esac
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 # No further processing by lesspipe necessary
<br/>
 exit 0
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

When trying to open compressed 0 byte files, <i>less</i> displays the actual
  binary file contents. This is not a bug. <i>less</i> is designed to do that
  (see manual page less(1), section INPUT PREPROCESSOR). This is the answer of
  Mark Nudelman &lt;markn@greenwoodsoftware.com&gt;:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;I recognized when I designed it that a lesspipe
      filter cannot output an empty file and have less display nothing in that
      case; it's a side effect of using the &quot;no output&quot; case to mean
      &quot;the filter has nothing to do&quot;. It could have been designed to
      have some other mechanism to indicate &quot;nothing to do&quot;, but
      &quot;no output&quot; seemed the simplest and most intuitive for lesspipe
      writers.&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes, less does not display the contents file you want to view but output
  that is produced by your login scripts (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile). This
  happens because less uses your current shell to run the lesspipe filter. Bash
  first looks for the variable $BASH_ENV in the environment expands its value
  and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. If this
  file produces any output less will display this. A way to solve this problem
  is to put the following lines on the top of your login script that produces
  output:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 if [ -z &quot;$PS1&quot; ]; then
<br/>
 exit
<br/>
 fi
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This tests whether the prompt variable $PS1 is set and if it isn't (which is the
  case for non-interactive shells) it will exit the script.
