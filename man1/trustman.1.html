<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
trustman - Manage keys used as trust anchors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
trustman [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
trustman manages keys used by DNSSEC as trust anchors in
compliance with RFC5011. It may be used as a daemon for
ongoing key verification or manually for initialization and
one- <br>
time key verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, trustman runs as a
daemon to ensure that keys stored locally in configuration
files still match the same keys fetched from the zone where
they are defined. In <br>
addition, these checks can be run once manually (-S) and in
the foreground (-f).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each key mismatch check, if
key mismatches are detected then trustman performs the
following operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- sets an add hold-down timer
for new keys; <br>
- sets a remove hold-down timer for missing keys; <br>
- removes revoked keys from the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On subsequent runs, the timers
are checked. If the timers have expired, keys are added to
or removed from the configuration file, as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">named.conf and dnsval.conf are
the usual configuration files. These files must be specified
in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file or in command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
trustman takes a number of options, each of which is
described in this section. Each option name may be shortened
to the minimum number of unique characters, but some options
<br>
also have an alias (as noted.) The single-letter form of
each option is denoted in parentheses, e.g.:
-anchor_data_file (-a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-anchor_data_file file (-a) <br>
A persistent data file for storing new keys waiting to be
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config file (-c) <br>
Create a configuration file for trustman from the command
line options given. The existing DNSSEC-Tools configuration
file is copied to the specified configuration file, and <br>
new configuration entries are appended corresponding to the
command line options. trustman-specific entries already in
the existing configuration file will be replaced with <br>
new entries from the command line. This will allow fewer
command line options to be specified in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dnsval_conf_file
/path/to/dnsval.conf (-k) <br>
A dnsval.conf file to read, and possibly be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dtconfig config_file (-d) <br>
Name of an alternate DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to be
processed. If specified, this configuration file is used in
place of the normal DNSSEC-Tools configuration file, <br>
not in addition to it. Also, it will be handled prior to
keyrec files, rollrec files, and command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground (-f) <br>
Run in the foreground. trustman will still run in a loop. To
run once, use the -single_run option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hold_time seconds (-w) <br>
The value of the hold-down timer. This is the number of
seconds from the time that a new key is found. Generally,
the default and recommended value of 30 days should be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mail_contact_addr email_address
(-m) <br>
Mail address for the contact person to whom reports should
be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-monitor (-M) <br>
Indicates that trustman was run from a monitoring system,
and a summary of events will be printed. Specifying this
option automatically turns on the -single_run option and
<br>
turns off the -verbose option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was developed for use with
the Nagios monitoring system, but it can be adapted for
other monitors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-named_conf_file
/path/to/named.conf (-n) <br>
A named.conf file to read, and possibly update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomail <br>
Prevents mail from being sent, even if an SMTP server was
specified in the configuration file. This is useful for only
sending notifications via stdout (-p) or syslog (-L).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-norevoke <br>
This option turns off checks for the REVOKE bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_error (-N) <br>
Send report even when there are no errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print (-p) <br>
Log messages to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resolv_conf_file conffile (-r)
<br>
A resolv.conf file to read. /dev/null can be specified to
force libval to recursively answer the query rather than
asking other name servers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-root_hints_file
/path/to/root.hints (-o) <br>
A root.hints file to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-single_run (-S) <br>
Do not loop, but run only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sleeptime seconds (-t) <br>
The number of seconds to sleep between checks. Default is
3600 (one hour.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smtp_server smtpservername (-s)
<br>
The SMTP server that trustman should use to send reports by
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syslog (-L) <br>
Log messages to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tmp_dir directory (-T) <br>
Specifies where temporary files should be created. This is
used when creating new versions of the dnsval.conf and
named.conf files before they are moved into place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files created in this directory
will be renamed to their final location. You should ensure
that this directory, the final dnsval.conf location, and the
final named.conf <br>
location are on the same disk partition. Most operating
systems will only rename files within a partition and will
give an error if told to rename a file from one partition
<br>
to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zone zone (-z) <br>
The zone to check. Specifying this option supersedes the
default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help (-h) <br>
Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose (-v) <br>
Gives verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version (-V) <br>
Displays the version information for trustman and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
In addition to the command line arguments, the
dnssec-tools.conf file can be configured with the following
values to remove the need to use some of the command-line
options. The <br>
command-line options always override the settings in the
dnssec-tools.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">taanchorfile file <br>
This specifies the file where trustman state information
will be kept. This is equivalent to the -anchor_data_file
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tacontact contact_email <br>
This is equivalent to the -mail_contact_addr flag for
specifying to whom email notices will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tadnsvalconffile file <br>
This specifies the dnsval.conf file to read and write. This
is equivalent to the -dnsval_conf_file flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tanamedconffile file <br>
This specifies the named.conf file to read and write. This
is equivalent to the -named_conf_file flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">taresolvconffile file <br>
This specifies the resolv.conf file to use. This is
equivalent to the -resolv_conf_file flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">taroothintsfile file <br>
This specifies the root.hints file to read. This is
equivalent to the -root_hints_file flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tasmtpserver servername <br>
This is equivalent to the -smtp_server flag for specifying
the SMTP server to which email notices will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tatmpdir directory <br>
This specifies where temporary files should be created. This
is used when creating new versions of the dnsval.conf and
named.conf files before they&rsquo;re moved into place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the note about renaming in
the description of the -tmp_dir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
trustman may exit for the following reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 - Successful execution. In
daemon mode, this may just mean <br>
that the daemon was successfully started. The daemon itself
<br>
may exit with some other error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Invalid options were
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 - No new-key file was
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 - Unable to open the new-key
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 - Unable to determine a set of
zones to check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 - Some form of file-management
error was encountered.</p>
