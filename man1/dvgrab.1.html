<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvgrab &acirc; Capture DV or MPEG-2 Transport Stream (HDV)
video and audio data from FireWire</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvgrab [options] [base] [-]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dvgrab is a program that captures DV or HDV (MPEG2-TS) video
and audio data from digital camcorders via FireWire (IEEE
1394). The data is stored in one or several files and can
<br>
later be processed by video editing software. dvgrab can
remote control the camcorder but it does not show the
video&rsquo;s content on screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab also supports UVC (USB
Video Class) compliant DV devices using Linux kernel module
uvcvideo, which is a V4L2 driver. In this mode, there is no
AV/C VTR control and there&acirc; <br>
fore interactive mode is almost useless. interactive feature
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The base argument is used to
construct the filename to store video data: base-num.ext.
num is a running number starting from 001, and ext is the
file name extension specifying <br>
the file format used, e.g. avi. A different naming scheme is
used whenever the -timestamp, -timecode, or -timesys is
given (see below). If base is a full filename including <br>
extension, then dvgrab attempts to determine the output file
format from the extension, but it still inserts num. The
default value for base is &quot;dvgrab-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a trailing
&rsquo;-&rsquo; then the format is forced to raw DV or HDV
and sent to stdout. dvgrab will also output raw DV or HDV to
stdout while capturing to a file if stdout <br>
is piped or redirected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use dvgrab&rsquo;s
powerful file writing capabilities with other programs that
produce raw DV or HDV. Using the -stdin option and if dvgrab
detects that it is on the receiving <br>
end of a pipe and it is not in interactive mode, then it
will try to read raw DV or HDV on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options longer than a single character can be specified with
either one or two leading hyphens. Also, you can use a space
character or equal sign to separate the option name and <br>
its argument value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a[num], -autosplit[=num] <br>
Try to detect whenever a new recording starts, and store it
into a separate file. This can be combined with the -frames
and -size options, and a split occurs whenever a <br>
specified event arises. Autosplit is off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num is optional. Without it,
dvgrab determines when to split using a flag in the stream
or a discontinuity in the timecode, where timecode
discontinuity is anything <br>
backwards or greater than one second. If you set the
optional argument num you can set the time sensitivity in
seconds and ignore the stream&rsquo;s new-recording flag.
This <br>
basically lets you split on larger time increments such as
minutes or hours. For example, -autosplit=3600 splits the
recording whenever there is a gap in the recording <br>
that is an hour or longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-buffers num <br>
The number of frames to use for buffering device I/O delays.
Defaults to 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-card num Tells dvgrab to
receive data from FireWire card num. The default behaviour
is to automatically select the first card containing the
first discovered camera If used in <br>
conjunction with -noavc, then no bus probing is performed If
used in conjunction with -guid hex, then only the specified
bus is probed for node with guid hex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-channel num <br>
Isochronous channel to receive data from. Defaults to 63,
which is pretty much standard among DV camcorders these
days. If you specify anything different, no attempt is <br>
made at this time to tell the device which channel to use.
You must have some manual way to tell the transmitting
device which channel to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmincutsize num <br>
This option is used to start the collection if a cut occurs
num megabytes (actually, mebibytes) prior to the end of the
collection. This option reduces small files <br>
being created when using the -csize option. When a new
collection is started in this manner, the amount of free
space in the previous collection is stored, and while <br>
the following clips fit within the previous collection, the
new collection starting point is reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-csize num <br>
This option tells dvgrab to split the files when the
collection of files exceeds num . This option is used to
create collections of files that fit perfectly into num <br>
megabytes (actually, mebibytes) (i.e. for archiving onto
DVD). When this occurs, a new collection is started (See
also the -cmincutsize option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug type <br>
Display HDV debug info, type is one or more of:
all,pat,pmt,pids,pid=N,pes,packet,video,sonya1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -duration time <br>
Set the maximum capture duration across all file splits for
a single capture session (multiple sessions are possible in
interactive mode). The time value is expressed <br>
in SMIL2 MediaClipping Time format. See
http://w3.org/AudioVideo/ for the specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Briefly, the formats are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XXX[.Y]h, XXX[.Y]min,
XXX[.Y][s], XXXms,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[HH:]MM:]SS[.ms], or
smpte=[[[HH:]MM:]SS:]FF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-every n This option tells
dvgrab to write every n&rsquo;th frame only (default all
frames).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -format dv1 | dv2 | avi |
raw | dif | qt | mov | jpeg | jpg | mpeg2 | hdv <br>
Specifies the format of the output file(s). File format can
also be determined if you include an extension on the base
name. The following extensions are recognizable: <br>
avi, dv, dif, mov, jpg, jpeg, and m2t (HDV).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dv1 and dv2 both are AVI files
with slightly different formats. dv2 stores a separate audio
track in addition to the DV video track, which is more
compatible with <br>
other applications. dv1 only stores a single, integrated DV
track since the DV format natively interleaves audio with
video. Therefore, while dv1 produces smaller out&acirc; <br>
put, some applications won&rsquo;t grok it and require dv2
instead. dvgrab is capable of creating extremely large AVI
files&acirc;well over 2 or 4 GB&acirc;however, compatibility
with <br>
other tools starts to decrease over the 1 GB size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw stores the data unmodified
and have the .dv extension. These files are read by a number
of GNU/Linux tools as well as Apple Quicktime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dif is a variation of raw DV
that names files with a .dif extension so they can be more
immediately loaded into MainConcept MainActor5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qt is Quicktime, but requires
that dvgrab be compiled with libquicktime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpg or jpeg is for a sequence of
JPEG image files if dvgrab was compiled with libdv and
jpeglib. This option can only be used with a DV input, not
HDV (MPEG2-TS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpeg2 or hdv is for a MPEG-2
transport stream when using, for example, a HDV camcorder or
digital TV settop box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, -frames num <br>
This option tells dvgrab to store at most num frames per
file before splitting to a new file, where num = 0 means
ulimited. The corresponding time depends on the video <br>
system used. PAL shows 25, NTSC about 30 frames per
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-guid hex If you have more than
one DV device, then select one using the node&rsquo;s GUID
specified in hex (hexadecimal) format. This is the format as
displayed in <br>
/proc/bus/ieee1394/devices or the new kernel 2.6 /sys
filesystem. When you specify a GUID, dvgrab will establish
(or overlay) a peer-to-peer connection with the device <br>
instead of listening to the device&rsquo;s broadcast. If you
supply a hex value of 1, then dvgrab attempts to discover
the device as well as setup a peer-to-peer connection. <br>
This is especially handy with MPEG2-TS settop boxes, which
typically require a connection management procedure to start
transmitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -help Show summary of
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, -input file <br>
Read from file instead of FireWire. You can use
&rsquo;-&rsquo; for stdin instead of using -stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, -interactive <br>
Make dvgrab interactive where single keypresses on stdin
control the camera VTR or start and stop capture. Otherwise,
dvgrab runs in session mode, where it immediately <br>
starts capture and stops as directed or interrupted
(ctrl-c).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jpeg-deinterlace <br>
If using -format jpeg, deinterlace the output by doubling
the lines of the upper field. This is a cheap form of
deinterlace that results in an effective 50% loss in <br>
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jpeg-height num <br>
If using -format jpeg, scale the output of the height to num
(1 - 2048).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jpeg-overwrite name <br>
Write to same image file for each frame, instead of creating
a sequence of image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jpeg-quality num <br>
If using -format jpeg, set the JPEG quality level from 0
(worst) to 100 (best).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jpeg-temp name 10 <br>
Use a temporary file to create the jpeg, rename the file to
the target file name when done. Useful when using dvgrab
with -jpeg-overwrite for generating a webcam image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jpeg-width num <br>
If using -format jpeg, scale the output of the width to num
(1 - 2048).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JPEG scaling width and
height must be both either less than or greater than the
normal frame size. For example, the scaled size of 700 wide
by 525 high yields a <br>
nice 4:3 aspect image with square pixels, but it is illegal
for NTSC because 700 is less than the normal width of 720
while the height is greater than the normal height <br>
of 480.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since DV uses non-square pixels,
it is nice to be able to scale to an image based upon a 4:3
aspect ratio using square pixels. For NTSC, example sizes
are 800x600, <br>
640x480, and 320x240. For PAL, example square pixel sizes
are 384x270 and 768x540.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jvc-p25 Remove
repeat_first_field flag and set frames per second to 25 to
correct a stream recorded in JVC&rsquo;s HDV P25 mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lockstep Align capture to a
multiple of -frames based on timecode. This is useful for
redundancy, when more than one machine is capturing from the
same FireWire device, and you <br>
want to ensure each file contains the same footage. To
ensure the files from each machine have the same name use
the -timecode option and the same base name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lockstep_maxdrops num <br>
If num frames are dropped consecutively, then close the file
and resume capture on the next lockstop interval. If num is
-1, then permit an unlimited number of consecu&acirc; <br>
tively dropped frames; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lockstep_totaldrops num <br>
If num frames are dropped in the current file, then close
the file and resume capture on the next lockstep interval.
If num is -1, then permit an unlimited number of <br>
total dropped frames; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noavc Disable use of AV/C VTR
control. This is useful if you are capturing live video from
a camera because in camera mode, an AV/C play command tells
the camera to start <br>
recording, perhaps over material on the current tape. This
applies to either interactive more or non-interactive
because non-interactive stills sends a play and stop <br>
to the VTR upon capture start and stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostop Disables sending the
AV/C VTR stop command when exiting dvgrab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-opendml If using -format dv2,
create an OpenDML-compliant type 2 DV AVI. This is required
to support dv2 files &gt;1GB. dv1 always supports files
&gt;1GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, -recordonly <br>
When the camcorder is in record mode, this option causes
dvgrab to only capture when the camcorder is recording and
not paused. Normally, when in record mode, dvgrab <br>
always captures to let you use the camcorder purely as a
camera where the computer operator is in control. This
option makes dvgrab act like the VCR where the camera <br>
operator controls when capture takes place. This is very
handy when used with the -autosplit option to automatically
create a new file for each shot. This option <br>
requires AV/C and will not work with the -noavc option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rewind Rewind the tape
completely to the beginning prior to starting capture.
Naturally, this requires AV/C; however, perhaps not so
obvious is that this does not apply to <br>
interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showstatus <br>
Normally, the capture status information is displayed after
finished writing to each file. This option makes it show the
capture status during capture, updated for each <br>
frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, -size num <br>
This option tells dvgrab to store at most num megabytes
(actually, mebibytes) per file, where num = 0 means
unlimited file size for large files. The default size limit
<br>
is 1024 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-srt Generate subtitle files
containing the recording date and time in SRT format. For
each video file that is created two additional files with
the extension .srt0 and <br>
.srt1 are created. They contain the recording date and time
as subtitles in the SRT format. The .srt0 file contains the
subtitles with timing based on the running time <br>
from the start of the current file. Use this file if you
transcode to a format like AVI. The .srt1 file contains the
subtitles with timing based on the time code as <br>
delivered by the camera. The mplayer program understands
this type of subtitles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdin Read the DV stream from a
pipe on stdin instead of FireWire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timecode Put the timecode of
the first frame of each file into the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, -timestamp <br>
Put information on date and time of recording into file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timesys Put system rather than
recording date and time into file name. This is useful when
using converter devices that do not change the recording
date time in the DV stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, -v4l2 Capture from a USB
Video Class (UVC) device that supports DV. This uses the
uvcvideo kernel module via V4L2. The default device file is
/dev/video. Use the -input <br>
option to set a different device file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -version <br>
Show version of program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-24p For Quicktime DV, set the
frame rate as 24 fps in the Quicktime file. This only works
as expected when the video has been shot in 24p mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-24pa For Quicktime, DV, in
addition to setting the frame rate to 24 in the Quicktime
file, also reverse the 2:3:3:2 pulldown process by removing
the interlaced &quot;C&quot; frame. <br>
This only works as expected when the video has been shot in
24p Advanced mode. See http://www.adamwilt.com/24p/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
dvgrab foo- <br>
Captures video data from the default FireWire source and
stores it to files foo-001.avi, foo-002.avi, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -frames 25 foo- <br>
Assuming a PAL video source, this command records one
second&rsquo;s worth of video data per file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -autosplit -frames 750
-timestamp foo- <br>
Records video data from the default FireWire source, cuts it
into chunks of 30 seconds (assuming PAL) or when a new
recording starts and names the resulting files <br>
according to date and time info in the videostream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -autosplit -size 1998
-csize 4400 -cmincutsize 10 foo- <br>
Records video data from the default FireWire source, cuts it
into chunks when a new recording starts or when the current
file exceeds 1998 megabytes (actually, <br>
mebibytes), or the current collection of files exceeds 4400
megabytes. It also reduces the size of the smallest file
made due to a collection size cut to 10 megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is perfect for
backing up DV to DVD&rsquo;s as 2 Gb is around the maximum
file size that (the current) linux implementation of the
ISO9660 filesystem can handle!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: It is possible to make
ISO9660 filesystems with files greater than 2 Gb, but the
current linux IS09660 driver can&rsquo;t read them! Newer
linux kernels may be able <br>
to handle ISO9660 filesystems with filesizes greater than 2
Gb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -format hdv -autosplit
<br>
Capture from a HDV camcorder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -format mpeg2 -guid 1
<br>
Record from a digital TV settop box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -jpeg-over -jpeg-w=320
-jpeg-h=240 -d smpte=1 webcam.jpeg <br>
Capture a single frame, save it as a JPEG named webcam.jpg
and exit. This example also demonstrates option handling.
You only need to specify enough of a long option <br>
name to uniquely identify it. You can use space or equal
sign to separate option name and argument. The file format
is inferred from the filename extension. Also, since <br>
-jpeg-overwrite is used, the filename will be exactly
&quot;webcam.jpeg&quot; and not include any numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -V Capture over USB from
a UVC compliant DV device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -v4l -input /dev/video1
<br>
Capture over USB from a UVC compliant DV device using device
file /dev/video1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvgrab -format=hdv
-autosplit=28800 -srt foo- <br>
Capture from a HDV camcorder, splitting whenever there is a
gap in the recording that lasts longer than 8 hours. This
will likely generate a separate file for each day <br>
(useful for holiday videos). It will also generate subtitle
files. Assuming that the files foo-001.m2t and foo-002.m2t
are generated, the corresponding subtitle files <br>
will be foo-001.srt0, foo-001.srt1 and foo-002.srt0,
foo-002.srt1. You can use the subtitle files to show the
recording date and time while viewing the video.</p>
