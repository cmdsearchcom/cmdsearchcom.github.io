<p>XWORD(1) General Commands Manual XWORD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xword - do crossword puzzles in the Across Lite format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xword [puzzlefile.puz]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xword is a GTK program for doing crossword puzzles. It can
read and write puzzles in the Across Lite file format.
Consequently, it works well for doing puzzles from The New
York <br>
Times. As well as a clock, it supports printing. It also
auto-saves puzzles as you solve them so that you can return
to partially completed puzzles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
First, locate a puzzle on the web. The best place to go is
the web site of The New York Times. However, it costs money
to access these puzzles. Free puzzles are available from
<br>
The Houston Chronicle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you have found a puzzle,
click on it in your web browser. Xword will open the puzzle
and you can start solving. You can also choose to save the
puzzle on your hard disk. <br>
Then you can open the puzzle using Xword later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you have worked on a
puzzle for a while, you may want to save your work. There
are two ways to save. The easiest way is to close Xword
without any further action. The next <br>
time you open the same puzzle (either by opening the .puz
file or by clicking the same link on the web), you will be
asked whether you want to continue where you left off. If
you <br>
choose to continue, all your correct and incorrect answers
will be saved, as well as the time on the clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, this technique only
works for opening the puzzle on the same computer. If you
need to open the saved puzzle on a different computer, then
you can choose &quot;Save&quot; from the <br>
&quot;File&quot; menu. The saved file can be opened with
Xword on any computer. However, incorrect answers and the
time on the clock will not be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print a puzzle, select
&quot;Print&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu. You can
see what the printed puzzle will look like by clicking
&quot;Print Preview&quot;. You can select the paper size and
orienta&acirc; <br>
tion by clicking on the &quot;Paper&quot; tab (puzzles are
usually easier to read in landscape mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes a puzzle will be
locked so that the answers are unavailable. Unfortunately,
Xword&rsquo;s support for locked puzzles is somewhat flaky.
When using a locked puzzle, you <br>
should not click on the &quot;Check&quot; or
&quot;Solve&quot; buttons, since they will give incorrect
information. However, you can still use Xword to enter
answers for a locked puzzle. Later, when <br>
an unlocked version of the puzzle is released (usually the
next day), open it using Xword. When asked, choose to
continue where you left off. Now you can use the
&quot;Check&quot; and <br>
&quot;Solve&quot; buttons to see how well you did. Sometimes
crosswords will come with a four-digit code to unlock a
locked puzzle file. This code is not needed by Xword ...</p>
