<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
amsmib - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) MIB update
utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
amsmib application_name authority_name role_name
continuum_name unit_name file_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
amsmib is a utility program that announces relatively brief
Management Information Base (MIB) updates to a select
population of AMS modules. Because amsd processes may run
AAMS <br>
modules in background threads, and because a single MIB is
shared in common among all threads of any process, amsmib
may update the MIBs used by registrars and/or configuration
<br>
servers as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIB updates can only be
propagated to modules for which the subject
&quot;amsmib&quot; was defined in the MIB initialization
files cited at module registration time. All ION AMS modules
<br>
implicitly invite messages on subject &quot;amsmib&quot;
(from all modules registered in role &quot;amsmib&quot; in
all continua of the same venture) at registration time if
subject &quot;amsmib&quot; and <br>
role &quot;amsmib&quot; are defined in the MIB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsmib registers in the root
cell of the message space identified by application_name and
authority_name, within the local continuum. It registers in
the role &quot;amsmib&quot;; if this <br>
role is not defined in the (initial) MIB loaded by amsmib at
registration time, then registration fails and amsmib
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsmib then reads into a memory
buffer up to 4095 bytes of MIB update text from the file
identified by file_name. The MIB update text must conform to
amsxml(5) or amsrc(5) <br>
syntax, depending on whether or not the intended recipient
modules were compiled with the -DNOEXPAT option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsmib then
&quot;announces&quot; (see ams_announce() in ams(3)) the
contents of the memory buffer to all modules of this same
venture (identified by application_name and authority_name)
<br>
that registered in the indicated role, in the indicated unit
of the indicated continuum. If continuum_name is
&quot;&quot; then the message will be sent to modules in all
continua. If <br>
role_name is &quot;&quot; then all modules will be eligible
to receive the message, regardless of the role in which they
registered. If unit_name is &quot;&quot; (the root unit)
then all modules <br>
will be eligible to receive the message, regardless of the
unit in which they registered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon reception of the announced
message, each destination module will apply all of the MIB
updates in the content of the message, in exactly the same
way that its original MIB <br>
was loaded from the MIB initialization file when the module
started running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple modules are running
in the same memory space (e.g., in different threads of the
same process, or in different tasks on the same VxWorks
target) then the updates will <br>
be applied multiple times, because all modules in the same
memory space share a single MIB. MIB updates are idempotent,
so this is harmless (though some diagnostics may be <br>
printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, an amsd daemon will
have a relevant &quot;MIB update&quot; module running in a
background thread if application_name and authority_name
were cited on the command line that <br>
started the daemon (provided the role &quot;amsd&quot; was
defined in the initial MIB loaded at the time amsd began
running). The MIB exposed to the configuration server and/or
registrar <br>
running in that daemon will likewise be updated upon
reception of the announced message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the subject of the
announced mib update message is &quot;amsmib&quot;; if this
subject is not defined in the (initial) MIB loaded by amsmib
then the message cannot be <br>
announced. Nor can any potential recipient module receive
the message if subject &quot;amsmib&quot; is not defined in
that module&rsquo;s MIB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; amsmib terminated normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; An anomalous exit
status, indicating that amsmib failed to register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name
(see amsrc(5) and amsxml(5)) must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

The amsmib utility was unable to announce the MIB update
message.</p>

The amsmib utility was unable to announce the MIB update
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsmib domain continuum unknown.
<br>
The amsmib utility was unable to announce the MIB update
message.</p>

message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIB file length &gt; 4096. <br>

message buffer.</p>

file. <br>
I/O error in processing the MIB update text file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t read MIB file. <br>

message, for reasons noted in the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amsmib can&rsquo;t register.
<br>
The amsmib utility failed to register, for reasons noted in
the log file.</p>
