<p>IOSTAT(1) Linux User&rsquo;s Manual IOSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
iostat - Report Central Processing Unit (CPU) statistics and
input/output statistics for devices and partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
iostat [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -N ] [ -t ] [ -V ]
[ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ] [ -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... }
] [ [ -T ] -g group_name ] [ -p [ device [,...] | ALL ] <br>
] [ device [...] | ALL ] [ interval [ count ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The iostat command is used for monitoring system
input/output device loading by observing the time the
devices are active in relation to their average transfer
rates. The iostat <br>
command generates reports that can be used to change system
configuration to better balance the input/output load
between physical disks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first report generated by
the iostat command provides statistics concerning the time
since the system was booted, unless the -y option is used
(in this case, this first <br>
report is omitted). Each subsequent report covers the time
since the previous report. All statistics are reported each
time the iostat command is run. The report consists of a
<br>
CPU header row followed by a row of CPU statistics. On
multiprocessor systems, CPU statistics are calculated
system-wide as averages among all processors. A device
header row is <br>
displayed followed by a line of statistics for each device
that is configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interval parameter specifies
the amount of time in seconds between each report. The first
report contains statistics for the time since system startup
(boot), unless the -y <br>
option is used (in this case, this report is omitted). Each
subsequent report contains statistics collected during the
interval since the previous report. The count parameter <br>
can be specified in conjunction with the interval parameter.
If the count parameter is specified, the value of count
determines the number of reports generated at interval
sec&acirc; <br>
onds apart. If the interval parameter is specified without
the count parameter, the iostat command generates reports
continuously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTS <br>
The iostat command generates two types of reports, the CPU
Utilization report and the Device Utilization report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPU Utilization Report <br>
The first report generated by the iostat command is the CPU
Utilization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU
values are global averages among all processors. The <br>
report has the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%user <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level (application).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%nice <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level with nice priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%system <br>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the system level (kernel).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%iowait <br>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%steal <br>
Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the
virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing
another virtual processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%idle <br>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device Utilization Report <br>
The second report generated by the iostat command is the
Device Utilization Report. The device report provides
statistics on a per physical device or partition basis. <br>
Block devices and partitions for which statistics are to be
displayed may be entered on the command line. If no device
nor partition is entered, then statistics are dis&acirc;
<br>
played for every device used by the system, and providing
that the kernel maintains statistics for it. If the ALL
keyword is given on the command line, then statistics <br>
are displayed for every device defined by the system,
including those that have never been used. Transfer rates
are shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment
<br>
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte
blocks are used. The report may show the following fields,
depending on the flags used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device: <br>
This column gives the device (or partition) name as listed
in the /dev directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tps <br>
Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued
to the device. A transfer is an I/O request to the device.
Multiple logical requests can be combined <br>
into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of
indeterminate size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blk_read/s (kB_read/s,
MB_read/s) <br>
Indicate the amount of data read from the device expressed
in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.
Blocks are equivalent to sectors and therefore <br>
have a size of 512 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s,
MB_wrtn/s) <br>
Indicate the amount of data written to the device expressed
in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read) <br>
The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn) <br>
The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrqm/s <br>
The number of read requests merged per second that were
queued to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrqm/s <br>
The number of write requests merged per second that were
queued to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r/s <br>
The number (after merges) of read requests completed per
second for the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w/s <br>
The number (after merges) of write requests completed per
second for the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s) <br>
The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from the
device per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s) <br>
The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to the
device per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avgrq-sz <br>
The average size (in sectors) of the requests that were
issued to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avgqu-sz <br>
The average queue length of the requests that were issued to
the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">await <br>
The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued
to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by
the requests in queue and the time spent ser&acirc; <br>
vicing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r_await <br>
The average time (in milliseconds) for read requests issued
to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by
the requests in queue and the time spent <br>
servicing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w_await <br>
The average time (in milliseconds) for write requests issued
to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by
the requests in queue and the time spent <br>
servicing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">svctm <br>
The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests
that were issued to the device. Warning! Do not trust this
field any more. This field will be removed <br>
in a future sysstat version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%util <br>
Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were
issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device).
Device saturation occurs when this value is <br>
close to 100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Display the CPU utilization report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Display the device
utilization report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group_name { device [...] |
ALL } <br>
Display statistics for a group of devices. The iostat
command reports statistics for each individual device in the
list then a line of global statistics for the group <br>
displayed as group_name and made up of all the devices in
the list. The ALL keyword means that all the block devices
defined by the system shall be included in the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Make the Device Utilization
Report easier to read by a human.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID |
... } [ device [...] | ALL ] <br>
Display persistent device names. Options ID, LABEL, etc.
specify the type of the persistent name. These options are
not limited, only prerequisite is that directory with <br>
required persistent names is present in /dev/disk.
Optionally, multiple devices can be specified in the chosen
persistent name type. Because persistent device names are
<br>
usually long, option -h is enabled implicitly with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Display statistics in
kilobytes per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Display statistics in
megabytes per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Display the registered device
mapper names for any device mapper devices. Useful for
viewing LVM2 statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]
<br>
The -p option displays statistics for block devices and all
their partitions that are used by the system. If a device
name is entered on the command line, then statistics <br>
for it and all its partitions are displayed. Last, the ALL
keyword indicates that statistics have to be displayed for
all the block devices and partitions defined by the <br>
system, including those that have never been used. If option
-j is defined before this option, devices entered on the
command line can be specified with the chosen persis&acirc;
<br>
tent name type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T This option must be used with
option -g and indicates that only global statistics for the
group are to be displayed, and not statistics for individual
devices in the <br>
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Print the time for each
report displayed. The timestamp format may depend on the
value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment variable (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Display extended
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Omit first report with
statistics since system boot, if displaying multiple records
at given interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Tell iostat to omit output
for any devices for which there was no activity during the
sample period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The iostat command takes into account the following
environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_TIME_FORMAT <br>
If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the
current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the
report header. The iostat command will use the ISO 8601 <br>
format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead. The timestamp displayed with
option -t will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIXLY_CORRECT <br>
When this variable is set, transfer rates are shown in
512-byte blocks instead of the default 1K blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
iostat <br>
Display a single history since boot report for all CPU and
Devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iostat -d 2 <br>
Display a continuous device report at two second
intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iostat -d 2 6 <br>
Display six reports at two second intervals for all
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iostat -x sda sdb 2 6 <br>
Display six reports of extended statistics at two second
intervals for devices sda and sdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iostat -p sda 2 6 <br>
Display six reports at two second intervals for device sda
and all its partitions (sda1, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
/proc filesystem must be mounted for iostat to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kernels older than 2.6.x are no
longer supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The average service time (svctm
field) value is meaningless, as I/O statistics are now
calculated at block level, and we don&rsquo;t know when the
disk driver starts to process a <br>
request. For this reason, this field will be removed in a
future sysstat version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc/stat contains system statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/uptime contains system
uptime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/diskstats contains disks
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/sys contains statistics for
block devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/proc/self/mountstats contains
statistics for network filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/disk contains persistent
device names.</p>
