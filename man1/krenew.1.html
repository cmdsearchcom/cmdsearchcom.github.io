<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
krenew - Renew a Kerberos ticket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
krenew [-abhiLstvx] [-c child pid file] [-H minutes] <br>
[-K minutes] [-k ticket cache] [-p pid file] <br>
[command ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
krenew renews an existing renewable ticket. When run without
any arguments, it just attempts to renew the existing
ticket-granting ticket in the current ticket cache,
equivalent <br>
to &quot;kinit -R&quot;, but it can optionally run a program
like aklog to refresh AFS tokens, can run as a daemon and
wake up periodically to renew the ticket cache, or can run a
<br>
specified command and keep renewing the ticket cache until
the command finishes (or renewal is no longer possible). If
a command is specified, krenew by default wakes up every
<br>
60 minutes (1 hour) to check the ticket cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command is given, krenew
makes a copy of the ticket cache and creates a private
ticket cache just for that command, thus isolating it from
later destruction of the original <br>
ticket cache. This allows krenew to maintain authentication
for a command even if, for example, the user running the
command logs out and OpenSSH destroys their original ticket
<br>
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command is given, it will
not be run using the shell, so if you want to use shell
metacharacters in the command with their special meaning,
give &quot;sh -c command&quot; as the <br>
command to run and quote command. If the command contains
command-line options (like &quot;-c&quot;), put
&quot;--&quot; on the command line before the beginning of
the command to tell krenew to <br>
not parse those options as its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If krenew is built with setpag()
support and AFS tokens are requested with the -t option, it
will put the command in a separate PAG before obtaining AFS
tokens so that they don&rsquo;t <br>
interfere with other processes on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running a command, krenew
propagates HUP, TERM, INT, and QUIT signals to the child
process and does not exit when those signals are received.
(If the propagated signal <br>
causes the child process to exit, krenew will then exit.)
This allows krenew to react properly when run under a
command supervision system such as runit(8) or svscan(8)
that <br>
uses signals to control supervised commands, and to run
interactive commands that should receive Ctrl-C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a running krenew receives an
ALRM signal, it immediately refreshes the ticket cache
regardless of whether it is in danger of expiring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a When run with either the -K flag or a command, always
renew tickets each time krenew wakes up. Without this
option, krenew will only try to renew a ticket as often as
<br>
necessary to prevent the ticket from expiring. With this
option, krenew will renew tickets according to the interval
specified with the -K flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior probably should
have been the default behavior of -K. The default was not
changed to avoid changes for existing users, but for new
applications, consider <br>
always using -a with -K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is important if
another program is manipulating the ticket cache that krenew
is using. For example, if another program is automatically
renewing a ticket more <br>
frequently than krenew, then krenew will never see a ticket
that is close to expiring and will therefore, by default,
never try to renew the ticket. This means that krenew <br>
will also never renew AFS tokens, even if the -t option was
given, since krenew only renews AFS tokens after it
successfully renews a ticket. If this option is specified in
<br>
such a situation, krenew will renew its ticket every time it
checks the ticket, so AFS tokens will be renewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This argument is only valid in
combination with either -K or a command to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b After starting, detach from
the controlling terminal and run in the background. This
option only makes sense in combination with -K or a command
that krenew will be running. <br>
krenew will not background itself until after it does the
initial ticket renewal, so that any initial errors will be
reported, but it will then redirect output to /dev/null <br>
and no subsequent errors will be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this flag is given, krenew
will also change directories to &quot;/&quot;. All paths
(such as to a command to run or a PID file) should therefore
be given as absolute, not relative, <br>
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used in conjunction with a
command to run, that command will also run in the background
and will also have its input and output redirected to
/dev/null. It will have to <br>
report any errors via some other mechanism for the errors to
be seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this flag on Mac OS X
without specifying a file-based ticket cache by either using
-k or setting KRB5CCNAME will probably not do what you want.
Ticket caches on Mac <br>
OS X are, by default, per-session and with -b krenew will
detach itself from your existing ticket cache. Instead, to
renew the default ticket cache on Mac OS X, try <br>
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(krenew -K 60 &amp;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to run krenew in the background
but within the current session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using this option, consider
also using -L to report krenew errors to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c child pid file <br>
Save the process ID (PID) of the child process into child
pid file. child pid file is created if it doesn&rsquo;t
exist and overwritten if it does exist. This option is only
<br>
allowed when a command was given on the command line and is
most useful in conjunction with -b to allow management of
the running child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, when used with -b,
the PID file is written out after krenew is backgrounded and
changes its working directory to /, so relative paths for
the PID file will be <br>
relative to / (probably not what you want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H minutes <br>
Only renew the ticket if it has a remaining lifetime of less
than minutes minutes. If either the ticket already has a
sufficiently long remaining lifetime or renewal was <br>
successful, run the command (if one was specified) or exit
immediately with status 0 (if none was). Otherwise, try to
renew the ticket so that it will have a remaining <br>
lifetime of at least minutes, exit with an error if
unsuccessful, and then run the command, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -H is used with -K, krenew
will not exit immediately. Instead, the specified remaining
lifetime will replace the default value of two minutes,
meaning that krenew will <br>
ensure, each time it wakes up, that the ticket has a
remaining lifetime of the minutes argument. This is an
alternative to -a to ensure that tickets always have a
certain <br>
minimal amount of lifetime remaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore errors in renewing the
ticket and keep running. Normally, krenew exits as soon as
the ticket cache either disappears or the tickets run out of
renewable lifetime. If <br>
this flag is given, it will complain about the failure to
standard error (unless -b was given) but continue running,
waking up to try again after the next check interval (see
<br>
-K). This is useful if some other process may recreate an
expired ticket cache and krenew should stay around and act
on that recreated ticket cache once it&rsquo;s present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the initial ticket cache
renew fails, krenew will retry the renewal immediately and
then with exponential backoff to once per minute, and keep
trying until authentication <br>
succeeds or it is killed. The command, if any, will not be
started until cache renewal succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is only useful in
daemon mode or when a command was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K minutes <br>
Run in daemon mode to keep a ticket alive indefinitely. The
program reawakens after minutes minutes, checks if the
ticket will expire before or less than two minutes before
<br>
the next scheduled check, and renews the ticket if needed.
(In other words, it ensures that the ticket will always have
a remaining lifetime of at least two minutes.) If <br>
the -H flag is also given, the lifetime specified by it
replaces the two minute default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not given but
a command was given on the command line, the default
interval is 60 minutes (1 hour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurs in refreshing
the ticket cache that doesn&rsquo;t cause krenew to exit,
the wake-up interval will be shortened to one minute and the
operation retried at that <br>
interval for as long as the error persists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k ticket cache <br>
Use ticket cache as the ticket cache rather than the
contents of the environment variable KRB5CCNAME or the
library default. ticket cache may be any ticket cache
identifier <br>
recognized by the underlying Kerberos libraries. This
generally supports a path to a file, with or without a
leading &quot;FILE:&quot; string, but may also support other
ticket cache <br>
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Report messages to syslog as
well as to standard output or standard error. All messages
will be logged with facility LOG_DAEMON. Regular messages
that are displayed on <br>
standard output are logged with level LOG_NOTICE. Errors
that don&rsquo;t cause krenew to terminate when run with -i
are logged with level LOG_WARNING. Fatal errors are logged
<br>
with level LOG_ERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when debugging
problems in combination with -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid file <br>
Save the process ID (PID) of the running krenew process into
pid file. pid file is created if it doesn&rsquo;t exist and
overwritten if it does exist. This option is most useful
<br>
in conjunction with -b to allow management of the running
krenew daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, when used with -b the
PID file is written out after krenew is backgrounded and
changes its working directory to /, so relative paths for
the PID file will be <br>
relative to / (probably not what you want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Normally, when krenew exits
abnormally while running a command (if, for example, the
ticket&rsquo;s renewable lifetime has expired), it leaves
the command running. If -s is given, <br>
it will send a SIGHUP signal to the command before exiting.
This can be useful if it&rsquo;s pointless for the command
to keep running without Kerberos tickets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Run an external program after
getting a ticket. The default use of this is to run aklog to
get a token. If the environment variable KINIT_PROG is set,
it overrides the <br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If krenew has been built with
AFS setpag() support and a command was given on the command
line, krenew will create a new PAG before obtaining AFS
tokens. Otherwise, it will <br>
obtain tokens in the current PAG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. This will print
out a bit of additional information about what is being
attempted and what the results are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Exit immediately on any
error. Normally, when running a command or when run with the
-K option, krenew keeps running even if it fails to renew
the ticket cache as long as <br>
the ticket cache still exists and appears to be renewable.
It tries again at the next check interval. With this option,
krenew will instead exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
The program normally exits with status 0 if it successfully
renews a ticket. If krenew runs aklog or some other program
krenew returns the exit status of that program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Renew the current ticket-granting ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krenew</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wake up every ten minutes and
check to see if the ticket cache needs renewing. If it does,
re-run aklog as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krenew -K 10 -t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the program
/usr/local/bin/compute-job in the background, checking every
hour to see if the ticket needs to be renewed (the default).
Put the PID of the krenew job in <br>
/var/run/compute.pid. Obtain a new AFS token each time the
ticket has to be renewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krenew -b -t -p
/var/run/compute.pid /usr/local/bin/compute-job</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wanted to pass options to
/usr/local/bin/compute-job, putting a &quot;--&quot;
argument before it would be necessary to keep krenew from
interpreting those options as its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to redirect output
to a file that requires authentication to write to, you will
need to do that redirection in a sub-shell. In other words,
the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krenew -t compute-job &gt;
/afs/local/data/output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">won&rsquo;t work if
/afs/local/data/output requires an AFS token to write to.
The job, while running, will have an AFS token, but the
output redirection is done in the parent shell <br>
and doesn&rsquo;t benefit from krenew. The above should
instead be written as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krenew -t -- sh -c
&rsquo;compute-job &gt; /afs/local/data/output&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this command, the shell
doing the redirection will also be run under krenew and have
the benefit of the AFS token it obtains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the environment variable AKLOG is set, its value will be
used as the program to run with -t rather than the default
complied into krenew. If AKLOG is not set and KINIT_PROG
<br>
is set, its value will be used instead. KINIT_PROG is
honored for backward compatibility but its use is not
recommended due to its confusing name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no ticket file (with -k) or
command is specified on the command line, krenew will use
the environment variable KRB5CCNAME to determine the
location of the the ticket granting <br>
ticket. If the -k option is used, KRB5CCNAME will be set to
point to the ticket file before running the aklog program or
any command given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The default ticket cache is determined by the underlying
Kerberos libraries. The default path for aklog is determined
at build time, and will normally be whichever of aklog or
<br>
afslog is found in the user&rsquo;s path.</p>
