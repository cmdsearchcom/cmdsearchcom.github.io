krenew - Renew a Kerberos ticket

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>krenew</b> renews an existing renewable ticket. When run without any
  arguments, it just attempts to renew the existing ticket-granting ticket in
  the current ticket cache, equivalent to &quot;kinit -R&quot;, but it can
  optionally run a program like <b>aklog</b> to refresh AFS tokens, can run as a
  daemon and wake up periodically to renew the ticket cache, or can run a
  specified command and keep renewing the ticket cache until the command
  finishes (or renewal is no longer possible). If a command is specified,
  <b>krenew</b> by default wakes up every 60 minutes (1 hour) to check the
  ticket cache.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a command is given, <b>krenew</b> makes a copy of the ticket cache and
  creates a private ticket cache just for that command, thus isolating it from
  later destruction of the original ticket cache. This allows krenew to maintain
  authentication for a command even if, for example, the user running the
  command logs out and OpenSSH destroys their original ticket cache.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a command is given, it will not be run using the shell, so if you want to use
  shell metacharacters in the command with their special meaning, give &quot;sh
  -c <i>command</i>&quot; as the command to run and quote <i>command</i>. If the
  command contains command-line options (like &quot;-c&quot;), put
  &quot;--&quot; on the command line before the beginning of the command to tell
  <b>krenew</b> to not parse those options as its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>krenew</b> is built with <i>setpag()</i> support and AFS tokens are
  requested with the <b>-t</b> option, it will put the command in a separate PAG
  before obtaining AFS tokens so that they don't interfere with other processes
  on the system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running a command, <b>krenew</b> propagates HUP, TERM, INT, and QUIT
  signals to the child process and does not exit when those signals are
  received. (If the propagated signal causes the child process to exit,
  <b>krenew</b> will then exit.) This allows <b>krenew</b> to react properly
  when run under a command supervision system such as <i>runit</i>(8) or
  <i>svscan</i>(8) that uses signals to control supervised commands, and to run
  interactive commands that should receive Ctrl-C.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a running <b>krenew</b> receives an ALRM signal, it immediately refreshes the
  ticket cache regardless of whether it is in danger of expiring.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When run with either the <b>-K</b> flag or a command,
      always renew tickets each time <b>krenew</b> wakes up. Without this
      option, <b>krenew</b> will only try to renew a ticket as often as
      necessary to prevent the ticket from expiring. With this option,
      <b>krenew</b> will renew tickets according to the interval specified with
      the <b>-K</b> flag.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This behavior probably should have been the default behavior of <b>-K</b>.
      The default was not changed to avoid changes for existing users, but for
      new applications, consider always using <b>-a</b> with <b>-K</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is important if another program is manipulating the ticket cache
      that <b>krenew</b> is using. For example, if another program is
      automatically renewing a ticket more frequently than <b>krenew</b>, then
      <b>krenew</b> will never see a ticket that is close to expiring and will
      therefore, by default, never try to renew the ticket. This means that
      <b>krenew</b> will also never renew AFS tokens, even if the <b>-t</b>
      option was given, since <b>krenew</b> only renews AFS tokens after it
      successfully renews a ticket. If this option is specified in such a
      situation, <b>krenew</b> will renew its ticket every time it checks the
      ticket, so AFS tokens will be renewed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This argument is only valid in combination with either <b>-K</b> or a
      command to run.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">After starting, detach from the controlling terminal and
      run in the background. This option only makes sense in combination with
      <b>-K</b> or a command that <b>krenew</b> will be running. <b>krenew</b>
      will not background itself until after it does the initial ticket renewal,
      so that any initial errors will be reported, but it will then redirect
      output to <i>/dev/null</i> and no subsequent errors will be reported.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If this flag is given, <b>krenew</b> will also change directories to
      &quot;/&quot;. All paths (such as to a command to run or a PID file)
      should therefore be given as absolute, not relative, paths.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If used in conjunction with a command to run, that command will also run in
      the background and will also have its input and output redirected to
      <i>/dev/null</i>. It will have to report any errors via some other
      mechanism for the errors to be seen.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Use of this flag on Mac OS X without specifying a file-based ticket cache by
      either using <b>-k</b> or setting KRB5CCNAME will probably not do what you
      want. Ticket caches on Mac OS X are, by default, per-session and with
      <b>-b</b> <b>krenew</b> will detach itself from your existing ticket
      cache. Instead, to renew the default ticket cache on Mac OS X, try
      something like:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    (krenew -K 60 &amp;)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    to run <b>krenew</b> in the background but within the current session.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using this option, consider also using <b>-L</b> to report
      <b>krenew</b> errors to syslog.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b> <i>child pid file</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Save the process ID (PID) of the child process into
      <i>child pid file</i>. <i>child pid file</i> is created if it doesn't
      exist and overwritten if it does exist. This option is only allowed when a
      command was given on the command line and is most useful in conjunction
      with <b>-b</b> to allow management of the running child process.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that, when used with <b>-b</b>, the PID file is written out after
      <b>krenew</b> is backgrounded and changes its working directory to
      <i>/</i>, so relative paths for the PID file will be relative to <i>/</i>
      (probably not what you want).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-H</b> <i>minutes</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Only renew the ticket if it has a remaining lifetime of
      less than <i>minutes</i> minutes. If either the ticket already has a
      sufficiently long remaining lifetime or renewal was successful, run the
      command (if one was specified) or exit immediately with status 0 (if none
      was). Otherwise, try to renew the ticket so that it will have a remaining
      lifetime of at least <i>minutes</i>, exit with an error if unsuccessful,
      and then run the command, if any.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>-H</b> is used with <b>-K</b>, <b>krenew</b> will not exit
      immediately. Instead, the specified remaining lifetime will replace the
      default value of two minutes, meaning that <b>krenew</b> will ensure, each
      time it wakes up, that the ticket has a remaining lifetime of the
      <i>minutes</i> argument. This is an alternative to <b>-a</b> to ensure
      that tickets always have a certain minimal amount of lifetime
    remaining.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Ignore errors in renewing the ticket and keep running.
      Normally, <b>krenew</b> exits as soon as the ticket cache either
      disappears or the tickets run out of renewable lifetime. If this flag is
      given, it will complain about the failure to standard error (unless
      <b>-b</b> was given) but continue running, waking up to try again after
      the next check interval (see <b>-K</b>). This is useful if some other
      process may recreate an expired ticket cache and <b>krenew</b> should stay
      around and act on that recreated ticket cache once it's present.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the initial ticket cache renew fails, <b>krenew</b> will retry the
      renewal immediately and then with exponential backoff to once per minute,
      and keep trying until authentication succeeds or it is killed. The
      command, if any, will not be started until cache renewal succeeds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This flag is only useful in daemon mode or when a command was given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-K</b> <i>minutes</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Run in daemon mode to keep a ticket alive indefinitely. The
      program reawakens after <i>minutes</i> minutes, checks if the ticket will
      expire before or less than two minutes before the next scheduled check,
      and renews the ticket if needed. (In other words, it ensures that the
      ticket will always have a remaining lifetime of at least two minutes.) If
      the <b>-H</b> flag is also given, the lifetime specified by it replaces
      the two minute default.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If this option is not given but a command was given on the command line, the
      default interval is 60 minutes (1 hour).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If an error occurs in refreshing the ticket cache that doesn't cause
      <b>krenew</b> to exit, the wake-up interval will be shortened to one
      minute and the operation retried at that interval for as long as the error
      persists.</dd>

      <i>ticket cache</i> may be any ticket cache identifier recognized by the

      with or without a leading &quot;FILE:&quot; string, but may also support
      other ticket cache types.</dd>

    Note that, when used with <b>-b</b> the PID file is written out after

  <dd class="It-tag">Normally, when <b>krenew</b> exits abnormally while running
      a command (if, for example, the ticket's renewable lifetime has expired),
      it leaves the command running. If <b>-s</b> is given, it will send a
      SIGHUP signal to the command before exiting. This can be useful if it's
      pointless for the command to keep running without Kerberos tickets.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

    If <b>krenew</b> has been built with AFS <i>setpag()</i> support and a

      even if it fails to renew the ticket cache as long as the ticket cache
      still exists and appears to be renewable. It tries again at the next check

The program normally exits with status 0 if it successfully renews a ticket. If
  <b>krenew</b> runs aklog or some other program <b>krenew</b> returns the exit
  status of that program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Renew the current ticket-granting ticket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    krenew
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Wake up every ten minutes and check to see if the ticket cache needs renewing.
  If it does, re-run <b>aklog</b> as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    krenew -K 10 -t
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Run the program <i>/usr/local/bin/compute-job</i> in the background, checking
  every hour to see if the ticket needs to be renewed (the default). Put the PID
  of the <b>krenew</b> job in <i>/var/run/compute.pid</i>. Obtain a new AFS
  token each time the ticket has to be renewed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    krenew -b -t -p /var/run/compute.pid /usr/local/bin/compute-job
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you wanted to pass options to <i>/usr/local/bin/compute-job</i>, putting a
  &quot;--&quot; argument before it would be necessary to keep <b>krenew</b>
  from interpreting those options as its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to redirect output to a file that requires authentication to write
  to, you will need to do that redirection in a sub-shell. In other words, the
  following command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    krenew -t compute-job &gt; /afs/local/data/output
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
won't work if /afs/local/data/output requires an AFS token to write to. The job,
  while running, will have an AFS token, but the output redirection is done in
  the parent shell and doesn't benefit from <b>krenew</b>. The above should
  instead be written as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    krenew -t -- sh -c 'compute-job &gt; /afs/local/data/output'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With this command, the shell doing the redirection will also be run under
  <b>krenew</b> and have the benefit of the AFS token it obtains.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
If the environment variable AKLOG is set, its value will be used as the program
  to run with <b>-t</b> rather than the default complied into <b>krenew</b>. If
  AKLOG is not set and KINIT_PROG is set, its value will be used instead.
  KINIT_PROG is honored for backward compatibility but its use is not
  recommended due to its confusing name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no ticket file (with <b>-k</b>) or command is specified on the command line,
  <b>krenew</b> will use the environment variable KRB5CCNAME to determine the
  location of the the ticket granting ticket. If the <b>-k</b> option is used,
  KRB5CCNAME will be set to point to the ticket file before running the
  <b>aklog</b> program or any command given on the command line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
The default ticket cache is determined by the underlying Kerberos libraries. The
  default path for aklog is determined at build time, and will normally be
  whichever of <b>aklog</b> or <b>afslog</b> is found in the user's path.
