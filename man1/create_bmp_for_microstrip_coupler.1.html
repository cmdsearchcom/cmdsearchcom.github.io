<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler - bitmap generator for
microstrip coupler (part of atlc)</p>

t Er1 Er2 filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the
complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages
<br>
are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
time the version was produced should be found on your hard
drive, usually at <br>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html <br>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator
chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
are corrected in the documentation and placed at <br>
http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
released. Please, if you notice a problem with the
documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let
me <br>
know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler is a pre-processor for
atlc, part of atlc properties of a two and three conductor
electrical transmission line of arbitrary cross section. The
<br>
program create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler is used as a fast
way of generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a
graphics program), for microstrip couplers. Hence if the
dimen&acirc; <br>
sions of a coupler are known the odd mode, even mode,
differential mode and common mode impedances can be found.
If you know what impedances you require and want to find the
<br>
dimentions, then use
find_optimal_dimensions_for_microstrip_coupler instead. This
makes repeated calls to create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler.
The structure for which bitmaps are <br>
generated by create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler is shown
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters &rsquo;W&rsquo;
and &rsquo;H&rsquo; and the inner dimensions of the a metal
enclosure. These will generall be quite large compared to
the dimensions of the the PC - the diagram above is <br>
not to scale. The gap between the two coupled lines is s,
the width of the coupled lines is w and the spacing between
the edges of the coupled lines and the groundplane on the
<br>
top is g. Often, the upper groundplane is not close to the
coupled lines, in which case g will be quite large. The
thickness of the dielectic is h. Note that he is just the
<br>
dielectric, and does not include the thichkness of the
copper on the double-sided PCB. The thickness of copper on
the top layer is t. It is immaterial what the thickkness of
the <br>
lower layer is. The relative permittivity above the
dielectric is normally 1, but the relative permittivity of
the dielectric material will need to be either pre-defined
or <br>
defined on the command lines. See the section colours below
for more information on dielectrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bitmap is printed to the
file specified as the last argument</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bitmaps produced by
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler are 24-bit bit colour
bitmaps, as are required by atlc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permittivities of the
bitmap, set by &rsquo;Er1&rsquo; and &rsquo;Er2&rsquo;,
determine the colours in the bitmap. If Er1 or Er2 is 1.0,
1.0006, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3, 3.335, 3.7, 4.8, 10.2 or
<br>
100, then the colour corresponding to that permittivity will
be set according to the colours defined in COLOURS below. If
Er1 is not one of those permittivities, the region of <br>
permittivity Er1 will be set to the colour 0xCAFF00. If Er2
is not one of those values, then the region of the image
will be set to the colour 0xAC82AC. The program atlc does
not <br>
know what these two permittivites are, so they atlc, must be
told with the comand line option -d, as in example 4
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C Causes create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler to print
copyright and licensing information. -b bitmapsize <br>
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy
to which atlc is able to calculate the transmission
line&rsquo;s properties. The default value for
&rsquo;bitmapsize&rsquo; is normally <br>
4, although this is set at compile time. The value can be
set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not
sensible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Causes create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler to print some data
to stderr. Note, nothing extra goes to standard output, as
that is expected to be redirected to a bitmap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOURS <br>
The 24-bit bitmaps that atlc expects, have 8 bits assigned
to represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green.
Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a
<br>
total of 256*256*256=16777216 colours. Every one of the
possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the
stating the exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
<br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 <br>
blue = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff <br>
black = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 <br>
white = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff <br>
Brown = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff <br>
gray = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some colours, such as pink,
turquoise, sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly
different things to different people. This is not so with
atlc, as the program expects the colours <br>
below to be EXACTLY defined as given. Whether you feel the
colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in
your bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour
recog&acirc; <br>
nised by atlc, or you must define it with a command line
option (see OPTIONS and example 5 below). <br>
red = 255,000,000 or 0xFF0000 is the live conductor. <br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00FF00 is the grounded conductor.
<br>
blue = 000,000,000 or 0x0000FF is the negative conductor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All bitmaps must have the live
(red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is
not currently supported, but it will be used to indicate a
negative conductor, which <br>
will be needed if/when the program gets extended to analyse
directional couplers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following dielectrics are
recognised by atlc and so are produced by
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">white 255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as
Er=1.0 (vacuum) <br>
pink 255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air) <br>
L. blue 130,052,255 or 0x8235EF as Er=2.1 (PTFE) <br>
Mid gray 142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2 (duroid 5880)
<br>
mauve 255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33 (polyethylene) <br>
yellow 255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5 (polystyrene) <br>
sandy 239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3 (PVC) <br>
brown 188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335 (epoxy resin) <br>
Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8 (glass PCB) <br>
Dark gray 142,142,142 or 0x696969 as Er=6.15 (duroid 6006)
<br>
L. gray 240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2 (duroid 6010)
<br>
D. orange 213,160,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0 (mainly for
test purposes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are a few examples of the use of
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler. Again, see the html
documentation in atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html for
more examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first example, there is
just an air dielectric, so Er1=Er2=1.0. The inner of 1x1
inches (or mm, miles etc) is placed centrally in an outer
with dimensions 3 x 3 inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact place where the
dielectric starts (a) and its width (d) are unimportant, but
they must still be entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%

ex1.bmp <br>
% atlc ex1.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this second example, an inner
of 15.0 mm x 0.5 mm is surrounded by an outer with internal
dimensions of 61.5 x 20.1 mm. There is a material with
permittivity 2.1 (Er of PTFE) <br>
below the inner conductor. The output from
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler is sent to a file ex1.bmp,
which is then processed by atlc</p>

% atlc ex2.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In example 3, the bitmap is made
larger, to increase accuracy, but otherwise this is
identical to the second example. %

% atlc ex3.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the fourth example, materials
with permittivites 2.78 and 7.89 are used. While there is no
change in how to use create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler,
since these permittivities <br>
are not known, we must tell atlc what they are. %
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler 61 20 1 4 22 0.5 50 15 5
2.78 7.89 &gt; ex5.bmp % atlc -d CAFF00=2.78 -d AC82AC=7.89
ex5.bmp In <br>
the sixth and final example, the -v option is used to print
some extra data to stderr from
create_bmp_for_microstrip_coupler.</p>
