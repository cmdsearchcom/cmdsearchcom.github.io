The <i>fort77</i> utility is the interface to the FORTRAN compilation system; it
  shall accept the full FORTRAN-77 language defined by the
  ANSI&#x00A0;X3.9&#x2010;1978 standard. The system conceptually consists of a
  compiler and link editor. The files referenced by <i>operand</i>s are compiled
  and linked to produce an executable file. It is unspecified whether the
  linking occurs entirely within the operation of <i>fort77</i>; some
  implementations may produce objects that are not fully resolved until the file
  is executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>&#x2212;c</b> option is present, for all pathname operands of the form
  <i>file</i><b>.f</b>, the files:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
<b></b>
<b>$(basename </b><i>pathname</i>.f).o
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
shall be created or overwritten as the result of successful compilation. If the
  <b>&#x2212;c</b> option is not specified, it is unspecified whether such
  <b>.o</b> files are created or deleted for the <i>file</i><b>.f</b> operands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as <b>&#x2212;c</b>) and
  all operands compile and link without error, the resulting executable file
  shall be written into the file named by the <b>&#x2212;o</b> option (if
  present) or to the file <b>a.out</b>. The executable file shall be created as
  specified in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#x2010;2008, except that
  the file permissions shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU
<div class="Pp"></div>
and that the bits specified by the <i>umask</i> of the process shall be cleared.

<div class="Pp"></div>
In the absence of options that inhibit invocation of the link editor, such as

<div class="Pp"></div>
It is unspecified whether the library <b>libf.a</b> exists as a regular file.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
The name of this utility was chosen as <i>fort77</i> to parallel the renaming of
  the C compiler. The name <i>f77</i> was not chosen to avoid problems with
  historical implementations. The ANSI&#x00A0;X3.9&#x2010;1978 standard was
  selected as a normative reference because the ISO/IEC version of FORTRAN-77
  has been superseded by the ISO/IEC&#x00A0;1539:1991 standard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The file inclusion and symbol definition <b>#define</b> mechanisms used by the
  <i>c99</i> utility were not included in this volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008&#x2014;even though they are commonly
  implemented&#x2014;since there is no requirement that the FORTRAN compiler use
  the C preprocessor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;onetrip</b> option was not included in this volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008, even though many historical compilers support it, because
  it is derived from FORTRAN-66; it is an anachronism that should not be
  perpetuated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some implementations produce compilation listings. This aspect of FORTRAN has
  been left unspecified because there was controversy concerning the various
  methods proposed for implementing it: a <b>&#x2212;V</b> option overlapped
  with historical vendor practice and a naming convention of creating files with
  <b>.l</b> suffixes collided with historical <i>lex</i> file naming practice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no <b>&#x2212;I</b> option in this version of this volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 to specify a directory for file inclusion. An INCLUDE
  directive has been a part of the Fortran-90 discussions, but an interface
  supporting that standard is not in the current scope.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is noted that many FORTRAN compilers produce an object module even when
  compilation errors occur; during a subsequent compilation, the compiler may
  patch the object module rather than recompiling all the code. Consequently, it
  is left to the implementor whether or not an object file is created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A reference to MIL-STD-1753 was removed from an early proposal in response to a
  request from the POSIX FORTRAN-binding standard developers. It was not the
  intention of the standard developers to require certification of the FORTRAN
  compiler, and IEEE&#x00A0;Std&#x00A0;1003.9&#x2010;1992 does not specify the
  military standard or any special preprocessing requirements. Furthermore, use
  of that document would have been inappropriate for an international standard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The specification of optimization has been subject to changes through early
  proposals. At one time, <b>&#x2212;O</b> and <b>&#x2212;N</b> were Booleans:
  optimize and do not optimize (with an unspecified default). Some historical
  practice led this to be changed to:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x2212;O</b>&#x00A0;0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No optimization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x2212;O</b>&#x00A0;1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Some level of optimization.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x2212;O&#x00A0;</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Other, unspecified levels of optimization.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is not always clear whether ``good code generation'' is the same thing as
  optimization. Simple optimizations of local actions do not usually affect the
  semantics of a program. The <b>&#x2212;O</b> 0 option has been included to
  accommodate the very particular nature of scientific calculations in a highly
  optimized environment; compilers make errors. Some degree of optimization is
  expected, even if it is not documented here, and the ability to shut it off
  completely could be important when porting an application. An implementation
  may treat <b>&#x2212;O</b> 0 as ``do less than normal'' if it wishes, but this
  is only meaningful if any of the operations it performs can affect the
  semantics of a program. It is highly dependent on the implementation whether
  doing less than normal is logical. It is not the intent of the
  <b>&#x2212;O</b> 0 option to ask for inefficient code generation, but rather
  to assure that any semantically visible optimization is suppressed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The specification of standard library access is consistent with the C compiler
  specification. Implementations are not required to have
  <b>/usr/lib/libf.a</b>, as many historical implementations do, but if not they
  are required to recognize <b>f</b> as a token.
<div class="Pp"></div>
External symbol size limits are in normative text; conforming applications need
  to know these limits. However, the minimum maximum symbol length should be
  taken as a constraint on a conforming application, not on an implementation,
  and consequently the action taken for a symbol exceeding the limit is
  unspecified. The minimum size for the external symbol table was added for
  similar reasons.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section clearly specifies the behavior of the
  compiler when compilation or link-edit errors occur. The behavior of several
  historical implementations was examined, and the choice was made to be silent
  on the status of the executable, or <b>a.out</b>, file in the face of compiler
  or linker errors. If a linker writes the executable file, then links it on
  disk with <i>lseek</i>()s and <i>write</i>()s, the partially linked executable
  file can be left on disk and its execute bits turned off if the link edit
  fails. However, if the linker links the image in memory before writing the
  file to disk, it need not touch the executable file (if it already exists)
  because the link edit fails. Since both approaches are historical practice, a
  conforming application shall rely on the exit status of <i>fort77</i>, rather
  than on the existence or mode of the executable file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;g</b> and <b>&#x2212;s</b> options are not specified as
  mutually-exclusive. Historically, these two options have been
  mutually-exclusive, but because both are so loosely specified, it seemed
  appropriate to leave their interaction unspecified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The requirement that conforming applications specify compiler options separately
  is to reserve the multi-character option name space for vendor-specific
  compiler options, which are known to exist in many historical implementations.
  Implementations are not required to recognize, for example, <b>&#x2212;gc</b>
  as if it were <b>&#x2212;g</b> <b>&#x2212;c</b>; nor are they forbidden from
  doing so. The SYNOPSIS shows all of the options separately to highlight this
  requirement on applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Echoing filenames to standard error is considered a diagnostic message because
  it would otherwise be difficult to associate an error message with the erring
  file. They are described with ``may'' to allow implementations to use other
  methods of identifying files and to parallel the description in <i>c99</i>.
