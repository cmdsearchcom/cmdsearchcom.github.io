<p>REMCTL(1) remctl REMCTL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
remctl - Remote execution tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
remctl [-dhv] [-b source-ip] [-p port] [-s service] <br>
host command [subcommand [parameters ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
remctl is a program that allows a user to execute commands
remotely on a server that is running the remctld daemon.
remctl does not interpret the commands given to it. It <br>
passes them to the server and displays the return message.
The commands must be defined on the server-side before a
remctl client can execute them, and the user running remctl
<br>
must be authorized to execute the particular command on the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to remote commands is
authenticated via Kerberos GSS-API, so a user must have a
ticket granting ticket to use remctl. All transmissions to
and from the remctld server are <br>
encrypted using GSS-API&rsquo;s security layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host is the hostname of the
target server. command and subcommand together specify the
command to run and correspond to the command names in the
configuration file on the <br>
server. parameters are any additional command-line
parameters to pass to the remote command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The start of each option description is annotated with the
version of remctl in which that option was added with its
current meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b source-ip <br>
[3.0] When connecting to the remote remctl server, use
source-ip as the source IP address. This can be useful on
multihomed systems where the remctl connections need to be
<br>
made over a particular network. source-ip must be an IP
address, not a hostname, and can be either an IPv4 or IPv6
address (assuming IPv6 is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [1.10] Turn on extra
debugging output of the client-server interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [1.10] Show a brief usage
message and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
[1.0] Connect to the server on port. If this option
isn&rsquo;t given, the client first tries the registered
remctl port (4373) and then falls back on the legacy port
(4444) if <br>
that fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s service <br>
[1.0] Authenticate to the server with a service ticket for
service rather than the default server identity of
host/hostname. This may be necessary with, for instance, a
<br>
server where remctld is not running as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [1.10] Print the version of
remctl and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
remctl will exit with the exit status returned by the remote
command. If some network or authentication error occurred
and remctl was unable to run the remote command or <br>
retrieve its exit status, or if remctl was called with
invalid arguments, remctl will exit with status 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Release an AFS volume called ls.tripwire:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remctl lsdb afs release
ls.tripwire</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The default port was changed to the IANA-registered port of
4373 in version 2.11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for IPv6 was added in
version 2.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
If no principal is specified with -s, remctl canonicalizes
the server host name using DNS before connecting. This
ensures that the network connection and the GSS-API <br>
authentication use the same server name even if some common
DNS-based load-balancing schemes are in use. To disable this
canonicalization, specify the server principal using -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior, when the
port is not specified, of trying 4373 and falling back to
4444 will be removed in a future version of remctl in favor
of using the &quot;remctl&quot; service <br>
in /etc/services if set and then falling back on only 4373.
4444 was the poorly-chosen original remctl port and should
be phased out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using Heimdal with
triple-DES keys and talking to old servers that only speak
version one of the remctl protocol, remctl may have problems
with MIC verification. This <br>
doesn&rsquo;t affect new clients and servers since the
version two protocol doesn&rsquo;t use MICs. If you are
using Heimdal and run into MIC verification problems, see
the COMPATIBILITY <br>
section of gssapi(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The remctl port number, 4373, was derived by tracing the
diagonals of a QWERTY keyboard up from the letters
&quot;remc&quot; to the number row.</p>
