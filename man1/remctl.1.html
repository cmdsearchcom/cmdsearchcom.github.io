remctl [ <b>-dhv</b>] [<b>-b</b> <i>source-ip</i>] [<b>-p</b> <i>port</i>]

 <i>host</i> <i>command</i> [<i>subcommand</i> [<i>parameters</i> ...]]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>remctl</b> is a program that allows a user to execute commands remotely on a
  server that is running the remctld daemon. <b>remctl</b> does not interpret
  the commands given to it. It passes them to the server and displays the return
  message. The commands must be defined on the server-side before a
  <b>remctl</b> client can execute them, and the user running <b>remctl</b> must
  be authorized to execute the particular command on the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Access to remote commands is authenticated via Kerberos GSS-API, so a user must
  have a ticket granting ticket to use <b>remctl</b>. All transmissions to and
  from the remctld server are encrypted using GSS-API's security layer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>host</i> is the hostname of the target server. <i>command</i> and
  <i>subcommand</i> together specify the command to run and correspond to the
  command names in the configuration file on the server. <i>parameters</i> are
  any additional command-line parameters to pass to the remote command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The start of each option description is annotated with the version of
  <b>remctl</b> in which that option was added with its current meaning.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b> <i>source-ip</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[3.0] When connecting to the remote remctl server, use
      <i>source-ip</i> as the source IP address. This can be useful on
      multihomed systems where the remctl connections need to be made over a
      particular network. <i>source-ip</i> must be an IP address, not a
      hostname, and can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 address (assuming IPv6 is
      supported).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>

  <dd class="It-tag">[1.0] Connect to the server on <i>port</i>. If this option

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b> <i>service</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">[1.0] Authenticate to the server with a service ticket for

<b>remctl</b> will exit with the exit status returned by the remote command. If
  some network or authentication error occurred and <b>remctl</b> was unable to
  run the remote command or retrieve its exit status, or if <b>remctl</b> was
  called with invalid arguments, <b>remctl</b> will exit with status 1.

The default port was changed to the IANA-registered port of 4373 in version
  2.11.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for IPv6 was added in version 2.4.

If no principal is specified with <b>-s</b>, <b>remctl</b> canonicalizes the
  server host name using DNS before connecting. This ensures that the network
  connection and the GSS-API authentication use the same server name even if
  some common DNS-based load-balancing schemes are in use. To disable this
  canonicalization, specify the server principal using <b>-s</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default behavior, when the port is not specified, of trying 4373 and falling
  back to 4444 will be removed in a future version of <b>remctl</b> in favor of
  using the &quot;remctl&quot; service in <i>/etc/services</i> if set and then
  falling back on only 4373. 4444 was the poorly-chosen original remctl port and
  should be phased out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using Heimdal with triple-DES keys and talking to old servers that only
  speak version one of the remctl protocol, <b>remctl</b> may have problems with
  MIC verification. This doesn't affect new clients and servers since the
  version two protocol doesn't use MICs. If you are using Heimdal and run into
  MIC verification problems, see the COMPATIBILITY section of <i>gssapi</i>(3).

The remctl port number, 4373, was derived by tracing the diagonals of a QWERTY
  keyboard up from the letters &quot;remc&quot; to the number row.
