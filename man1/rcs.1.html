<p>RCS(1) General Commands Manual RCS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rcs - change RCS file attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rcs options file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rcs creates new RCS files or changes attributes of existing
ones. An RCS file contains multiple revisions of text, an
access list, a change log, descriptive text, and some
con&acirc; <br>
trol attributes. For rcs to work, the caller&rsquo;s login
name must be on the access list, except if the access list
is empty, the caller is the owner of the file or the
superuser, <br>
or the -i option is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames matching an RCS suffix
denote RCS files; all others denote working files. Names are
paired as explained in ci(1). Revision numbers use the
syntax described in ci(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i Create and initialize a new RCS file, but do not deposit
any revision. If the RCS file name has no directory
component, try to place it first into the subdirectory
./RCS, <br>
and then into the current directory. If the RCS file already
exists, print an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alogins <br>
Append the login names appearing in the comma-separated list
logins to the access list of the RCS file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Aoldfile <br>
Append the access list of oldfile to the access list of the
RCS file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e[logins] <br>
Erase the login names appearing in the comma-separated list
logins from the access list of the RCS file. If logins is
omitted, erase the entire access list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b[rev] <br>
Set the default branch to rev. If rev is omitted, the
default branch is reset to the (dynamically) highest branch
on the trunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cstring <br>
Set the comment leader to string. An initial ci, or an rcs
-i without -c, guesses the comment leader from the suffix of
the working file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is obsolescent,
since RCS normally uses the preceding $Log$ line&rsquo;s
prefix when inserting log lines during checkout (see co(1)).
However, older versions of RCS <br>
use the comment leader instead of the $Log$ line&rsquo;s
prefix, so if you plan to access a file with both old and
new versions of RCS, make sure its comment leader matches
its <br>
$Log$ line prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksubst <br>
Set the default keyword substitution to subst. The effect of
keyword substitution is described in co(1). Giving an
explicit -k option to co, rcsdiff, and rcsmerge over&acirc;
<br>
rides this default. Beware rcs -kv, because -kv is
incompatible with co -l. Use rcs -kkv to restore the normal
default keyword substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[rev] <br>
Lock the revision with number rev. If a branch is given,
lock the latest revision on that branch. If rev is omitted,
lock the latest revision on the default branch. <br>
Locking prevents overlapping changes. If someone else
already holds the lock, the lock is broken as with rcs -u
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[rev] <br>
Unlock the revision with number rev. If a branch is given,
unlock the latest revision on that branch. If rev is
omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Nor&acirc; <br>
mally, only the locker of a revision can unlock it. Somebody
else unlocking a revision breaks the lock. If RCS was
configured --with-mailer, then this causes a mail mes&acirc;
<br>
sage to be sent to the original locker. The message contains
a commentary solicited from the breaker. The commentary is
terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing <br>
. by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Set locking to strict. Strict
locking means that the owner of an RCS file is not exempt
from locking for checkin. This option should be used for
files that are shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Set locking to non-strict.
Non-strict locking means that the owner of a file need not
lock a revision for checkin. This option should not be used
for files that are <br>
shared. Whether default locking is strict is determined by
your system administrator, but it is normally strict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrev:[msg] <br>
Replace revision rev&rsquo;s log message with msg. If msg is
omitted, it defaults to &quot;*** empty log message
***&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Do not send mail when
breaking somebody else&rsquo;s lock. This option is not
meant for casual use; it is meant for programs that warn
users by other means, and invoke rcs -u <br>
only as a low-level lock-breaking operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nname[:[rev]] <br>
Associate the symbolic name name with the branch or revision
rev. Delete the symbolic name if both : and rev are omitted;
otherwise, print an error message if name is <br>
already associated with another number. If rev is symbolic,
it is expanded before association. A rev consisting of a
branch number followed by a . stands for the current <br>
latest revision in the branch. A : with an empty rev stands
for the current latest revision on the default branch,
normally the trunk. For example, rcs -nname: RCS/* as&acirc;
<br>
sociates name with the current latest revision of all the
named RCS files; this contrasts with rcs -nname:$ RCS/*
which associates name with the revision numbers extracted
<br>
from keyword strings in the corresponding working files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nname[:[rev]] <br>
Act like -n, except override any previous assignment of
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-orange <br>
deletes (&acirc;outdates&acirc;) the revisions given by
range. A range consisting of a single revision number means
that revision. A range consisting of a branch number means
the <br>
latest revision on that branch. A range of the form
rev1:rev2 means revisions rev1 to rev2 on the same branch,
:rev means from the beginning of the branch containing rev
<br>
up to and including rev, and rev: means from revision rev to
the end of the branch containing rev. None of the outdated
revisions can have branches or locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Run quietly; do not print
diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Run interactively, even if
the standard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sstate[:rev] <br>
Set the state attribute of the revision rev to state. If rev
is a branch number, assume the latest revision on that
branch. If rev is omitted, assume the latest revision <br>
on the default branch. Any identifier is acceptable for
state. A useful set of states is Exp (for experimental),
Stab (for stable), and Rel (for released). By default, <br>
ci(1) sets the state of a revision to Exp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t[file] <br>
Write descriptive text from the contents of the named file
into the RCS file, deleting the existing text. The file name
cannot begin with -. If file is omitted, obtain <br>
the text from standard input, terminated by end-of-file or
by a line containing . by itself. Prompt for the text if
interaction is possible; see -I. With -i, descriptive <br>
text is obtained even if -t is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t-string <br>
Write descriptive text from the string into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Preserve the modification
time on the RCS file unless a revision is removed. This
option can suppress extensive recompilation caused by a
make(1) dependency of some copy <br>
of the working file on the RCS file. Use this option with
care; it can suppress recompilation even when it is needed,
i.e. when a change to the RCS file would mean a <br>
change to keyword strings in the working file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print RCS&rsquo;s version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vn Emulate RCS version n. See
co(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsuffixes <br>
Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ci(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zzone Use zone as the default
time zone. This option has no effect; it is present for
compatibility with other RCS commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least one explicit option
must be given, to ensure compatibility with future planned
extensions to the rcs command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The -brev option generates an RCS file that cannot be parsed
by RCS version 3 or earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ksubst options (except
-kkv) generate an RCS file that cannot be parsed by RCS
version 4 or earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use rcs -Vn to make an RCS file
acceptable to RCS version n by discarding information that
would confuse version n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS version 5.5 and earlier does
not support the -x option, and requires a ,v suffix on an
RCS file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
rcs accesses files much as ci(1) does, except that it uses
the effective user for all accesses, it does not write the
working file or its directory, and it does not even read the
<br>
working file unless a revision number of $ is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RCSINIT <br>
Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.
A backslash escapes spaces within an option. The RCSINIT
options are prepended to the argument lists of most <br>
RCS commands. Useful RCSINIT options include -q, -V, -x, and
-z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS_MEM_LIMIT <br>
An integer lim, measured in kilobytes, specifying the
threshold under which commands will try to use memory-based
operations for processing the RCS file. (For RCS files <br>
of size lim kilobytes or greater, RCS will use the slower
standard input/output routines.) Default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Name of the temporary
directory. If not set, the environment variables TMP and
TEMP are inspected instead and the first value found is
taken; if none of them are set, a <br>
host-dependent default is used, typically /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The RCS file name and the revisions outdated are written to
the diagnostic output. The exit status is zero if and only
if all operations were successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for RCS
is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info(1) and RCS
programs are properly installed at your site, the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info rcs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual. Additionally, the RCS homepage:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has news and links to the latest
release, development site, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
A catastrophe (e.g. a system crash) can cause RCS to leave
behind a semaphore file that causes later invocations of RCS
to claim that the RCS file is in use. To fix this, remove
<br>
the semaphore file. A semaphore file&rsquo;s name typically
begins with , or ends with _.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The separator for revision
ranges in the -o option used to be - instead of :, but this
leads to confusion when symbolic names contain -. For
backwards compatibility rcs -o still <br>
supports the old - separator, but it warns about this
obsolete use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbolic names need not refer to
existing revisions or branches. For example, the -o option
does not remove symbolic names for the outdated revisions;
you must use -n to remove <br>
the names.</p>
