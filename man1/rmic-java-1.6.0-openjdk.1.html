<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rmic - The Java RMI Compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmic generates stub, skeleton,
and tie classes for remote objects using either the JRMP or
IIOP protocols. Also generates OMG IDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rmic [ options ] package-qualified-class-name(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The rmic compiler generates stub and skeleton class files
(JRMP protocol) and stub and tie class files (IIOP protocol)
for remote objects. These classes files are generated from
<br>
compiled Java programming language classes that are remote
object implementation classes. A remote implementation class
is a class that implements the interface java.rmi.Remote.
<br>
The class names in the rmic command must be for classes that
have been compiled successfully with the javac command and
must be fully package qualified. For example, running rmic
<br>
on the class file name HelloImpl as shown here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmic hello.HelloImpl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates the HelloImpl_Stub.class
file in the hello subdirectory (named for the class&rsquo;s
package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A skeleton for a remote object
is a JRMP protocol server-side entity that has a method that
dispatches calls to the actual remote object
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tie for a remote object is a
server-side entity similar to a skeleton, but which
communicates with the client using the IIOP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A stub is a client-side proxy
for a remote object which is responsible for communicating
method invocations on remote objects to the server where the
actual remote object imple&acirc; <br>
mentation resides. A client&rsquo;s reference to a remote
object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local
stub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, rmic generates stub
classes that use the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol version only, as
if the -v1.2 option had been specified. (Note that the
-vcompat option was the <br>
default in releases prior to 5.0.) Use the -iiop option to
generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A stub implements only the
remote interfaces, not any local interfaces that the remote
object also implements. Because a JRMP stub implements the
same set of remote interfaces as <br>
the remote object itself, a client can use the Java
programming language&rsquo;s built-in operators for casting
and type checking. For IIOP, the PortableRemoteObject.narrow
method must <br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-bootclasspath path <br>
Overrides location of bootstrap class files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath path <br>
Specifies the path rmic uses to look up classes. This option
overrides the default or the CLASSPATH environment variable
if it is set. Directories are separated by colons. <br>
Thus the general format for path is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
Specifies the root destination directory for the generated
class hierarchy. You can use this option to specify a
destination directory for the stub, skeleton, and tie files.
<br>
For example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% rmic -d /java/classes
foo.MyClass <br>
would place the stub and skeleton classes derived from
MyClass into the directory /java/classes/foo. If the -d
option is not specified, the default behavior is as if
&quot;-d .&quot; were <br>
specified: the package hierarchy of the target class is
created in the current directory, and stub/tie/skeleton
files are placed within it. (Note that in some previous
versions <br>
of rmic, if -d was not specified, then the package hierarchy
was not created, and all of the output files were placed
directly in the current directory.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extdirs path <br>
Overrides location of installed extensions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Enables generation of all
debugging information, including local variables. By
default, only line number information is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idl <br>
Causes rmic to generate OMG IDL for the classes specified
and any classes referenced. IDL provides a purely
declarative, programming language-independent way of
specifying an <br>
object&rsquo;s API. The IDL is used as a specification for
methods and data that can be written in and invoked from any
language that provides CORBA bindings. This includes Java
and <br>
C++ among others. See the Java Language to IDL Mapping @
<br>

http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/java_language_mapping_to_omg_idl.htm
(OMG) document for a complete description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -idl option is used,
other options also include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-always or -alwaysgenerate <br>
Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are
newer than the input class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-factory <br>
Uses factory keyword in generated IDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idlModule
fromJavaPackage[.class] <br>
toIDLModule Specifies IDLEntity package mapping. For
example: -idlModule foo.bar my::real::idlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idlFile fromJavaPackage[.class]
<br>
toIDLFile Specifies IDLEntity file mapping. For example:
-idlFile test.pkg.X TEST16.idl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iiop <br>
Causes rmic to generate IIOP stub and tie classes, rather
than JRMP stub and skeleton classes. A stub class is a local
proxy for a remote object and is used by clients to send
<br>
calls to a server. Each remote interface requires a stub
class, which implements that remote interface. A
client&rsquo;s reference to a remote object is actually a
reference to a <br>
stub. Tie classes are used on the server side to process
incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to the proper
implementation class. Each implementation class requires a
tie <br>
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoking rmic with the -iiop
generates stubs and ties that conform to this naming
convention:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">_&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
<br>
_&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -iiop option is used,
other options also include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-always or -alwaysgenerate <br>
Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are
newer than the input class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolocalstubs <br>
Do not create stubs optimized for same-process clients and
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noValueMethods <br>
Must be used with the -idl option. Prevents addition of
valuetype methods and initializers to emitted IDL. These
methods and initializers are optional for valuetypes, and
are <br>
generated unless the -noValueMethods option is specified
when using the -idl option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-poa <br>
Changes the inheritance from
org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl to
org.omg.PortableServer.Servant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PortableServer module for
the Portable Object Adapter @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/idl/POA.html
(POA) defines the native Servant type. In the Java
programming language, the Servant type is mapped to the Java
<br>
org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. It serves as the base
class for all POA servant implementations and provides a
number of methods that may be invoked by the application
pro&acirc; <br>
grammer, as well as methods which are invoked by the POA
itself and may be overridden by the user to control aspects
of servant behavior. Based on the OMG IDL to Java Language
<br>
Mapping Specification, CORBA V 2.3.1 ptc/00-01-08.pdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Used in conjunction with any
java option, it passes the option following the -J (no
spaces between the -J and the option) on to the java
interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep or -keepgenerated <br>
Retains the generated .java source files for the stub,
skeleton, and/or tie classes and writes them to the same
directory as the .class files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowarn <br>
Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out
any warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vcompat <br>
Generates stub and skeleton classes compatible with both the
1.1 and 1.2 JRMP stub protocol versions. (This option was
the default in releases prior to 5.0.) The generated <br>
stub classes will use the 1.1 stub protocol version when
loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine and will use the 1.2
stub protocol version when loaded into a 1.2 (or later)
vir&acirc; <br>
tual machine. The generated skeleton classes will support
both 1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol versions. The generated
classes are relatively large in order to support both modes
of <br>
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about
what classes are being compiled and what class files are
being loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v1.1 <br>
Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1 JRMP stub
protocol version only. Note that this option is only useful
for generating stub classes that are
serialization-com&acirc; <br>
patible with pre-existing, statically-deployed stub classes
that were generated by the rmic tool from JDK 1.1 and that
cannot be upgraded (and dynamic class loading is not <br>
being used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v1.2 <br>
(default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP stub
protocol version only. No skeleton classes are generated
with this option because skeleton classes are not used with
the <br>
1.2 stub protocol version. The generated stub classes will
not work if they are loaded into a JDK 1.1 virtual
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
CLASSPATH <br>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes.
Directories are separated by colons. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
java, javac, CLASSPATH</p>
