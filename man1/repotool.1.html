repotool is a script wrapper around repository operations that differ by
  version-control system. It is little use by itself, existing mainly to
  generate and simplify a conversion makefile usable with <b>reposurgeon</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not all actions are supported on all systems. You will get an error message and
  a return value of 1 when attempting an unsupported action.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;initialize&quot; option takes a project name (and, optionally,
  following source and target VCCS types) and generates a Makefile that will
  sequence various steps of a repository conversion. It also generates stub lift
  and options files. This is meant to be run in an empty work directory, and it
  is an error to do 'initialize' where any of these files already exist.
  Afterwards, you will need to set some variables in the Makefile; read its
  header comment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'export' action, run from within a repository directory, dumps a copy of a
  CVS, Subversion, git, bzr, hg, or darcs repository to a flat history file
  readable by reposurgeon. The format is usually a git-fast-import stream,
  except that Subversion repositories export as Subversion dump files; the point
  is to be a lossless erepresentation, or as close to one as possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'tags' option, run from within a repository directory, returns a list of the
  repository's release tags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'branches' option, run from within a repository directory , returns a list
  of the repository's branch names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'checkout' option checks out a working copy of the repository. It must be
  called from within the repository. It takes one required argument - the
  checkout directory location. It may take a following optional argument which
  is a tag or revision specification; if this argument is not given, the tip
  (most recent) mainline revision is assumed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'compare' action takes two repository directories and a revision spec
  (typically a tag name). If the revision spec is omitted, the tip of the main
  line of both repositories will be used. The selected revisions are cpmpared
  with diff -q -r, with noise due to SCCS/RCS/CVS keyword expansion ignored. You
  can follow the command verb with one or more -x options followed by basenames
  of paths to exclude from comparison. You can get a context-diff report on file
  differences with the -u option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'compare-tags' action takes two repository directories, extracts a list of
  tags from the first, then compares the repository contents at each tag in the
  list, generating a compare report for each. You can follow the command verb
  with one or more -x options followed by basenames of paths to exclude from
  comparison. You can get a context-diff report on file differences with the -u
  option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'compare-branches' action takes two repository directories, extracts a list
  of branches common to both, then compares the repository contents at each
  branch in the list, generating a compare report for each. You can follow the
  command verb with one or more -x options followed by basenames of paths to
  exclude from comparison. You can get a context-diff report on file differences
  with the -u option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'compare-all' action takes two repository directories, and runs all 3 above
  compare actions on them. Even if the same name is a tag in one repository and
  a branch in the other, it will compare them against each other. Not
  distinguishing them is useful as CVS tags that are not applied to every file
  in the repository may get converted to branches. The options are the same as
  'compare-tags'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'mirror' action makes or updates a local mirror of a Subversion or CVS repo.
  It requires a single argument, either a Subversion URL or a CVS URL, or the
  name of a local mirror directory created by a previous run. The first form
  creates a local mirror of the repository in a directory named after the last
  segment of the URL, with the suffix &#x201C;-mirror&#x201D; (the local mirror
  name can be overridden by an optional) second argument. The second form
  updates the local mirror, doing an incremental fetch; just give the mirror
  directory name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Subversion URLs are as specified in the public documentation for Subversion. CVS
  URLs must specify a host and repository path, followed by a '#', followed by a
  module name.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT

This program uses the $TMPDIR environment variable, defaulting to /tmp if it is
  not set.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REQUIREMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#REQUIREMENTS">REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
The export action is a wrapper around either native export facilities or the
  following engines: <b>cvs-fast-export</b>(1) (for CVS), <b>svnadmin</b>(1)
  (for SVN), <b>hg-fast-export.py</b>(1) (for hg). You must have the appropriate
  engine in your $PATH for whatever kind of repository you are streaming.
