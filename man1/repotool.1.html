<p>REPOTOOL(1) Development Tools REPOTOOL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
repotool - query or manipulate a CVS, Subversion, git, bzr,
hg, or darcs repository in a uniform way</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
repotool [action] [URL-or-dir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
repotool is a script wrapper around repository operations
that differ by version-control system. It is little use by
itself, existing mainly to generate and simplify a
conversion <br>
makefile usable with reposurgeon(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all actions are supported on
all systems. You will get an error message and a return
value of 1 when attempting an unsupported action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;initialize&quot;
option takes a project name (and, optionally, following
source and target VCCS types) and generates a Makefile that
will sequence various steps of a repository <br>
conversion. It also generates stub lift and options files.
This is meant to be run in an empty work directory, and it
is an error to do &rsquo;initialize&rsquo; where any of
these files <br>
already exist. Afterwards, you will need to set some
variables in the Makefile; read its header comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;export&rsquo; action,
run from within a repository directory, dumps a copy of a
CVS, Subversion, git, bzr, hg, or darcs repository to a flat
history file readable by reposurgeon. <br>
The format is usually a git-fast-import stream, except that
Subversion repositories export as Subversion dump files; the
point is to be a lossless erepresentation, or as close to
<br>
one as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;tags&rsquo; option,
run from within a repository directory, returns a list of
the repository&rsquo;s release tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;branches&rsquo;
option, run from within a repository directory , returns a
list of the repository&rsquo;s branch names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;checkout&rsquo;
option checks out a working copy of the repository. It must
be called from within the repository. It takes one required
argument - the checkout directory location. <br>
It may take a following optional argument which is a tag or
revision specification; if this argument is not given, the
tip (most recent) mainline revision is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;compare&rsquo; action
takes two repository directories and a revision spec
(typically a tag name). If the revision spec is omitted, the
tip of the main line of both repositories <br>
will be used. The selected revisions are cpmpared with diff
-q -r, with noise due to SCCS/RCS/CVS keyword expansion
ignored. You can follow the command verb with one or more -x
<br>
options followed by basenames of paths to exclude from
comparison. You can get a context-diff report on file
differences with the -u option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;compare-tags&rsquo;
action takes two repository directories, extracts a list of
tags from the first, then compares the repository contents
at each tag in the list, generating a <br>
compare report for each. You can follow the command verb
with one or more -x options followed by basenames of paths
to exclude from comparison. You can get a context-diff
report <br>
on file differences with the -u option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&rsquo;compare-branches&rsquo; action takes two repository
directories, extracts a list of branches common to both,
then compares the repository contents at each branch in the
list, <br>
generating a compare report for each. You can follow the
command verb with one or more -x options followed by
basenames of paths to exclude from comparison. You can get a
<br>
context-diff report on file differences with the -u
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;compare-all&rsquo;
action takes two repository directories, and runs all 3
above compare actions on them. Even if the same name is a
tag in one repository and a branch in the <br>
other, it will compare them against each other. Not
distinguishing them is useful as CVS tags that are not
applied to every file in the repository may get converted to
branches. <br>
The options are the same as &rsquo;compare-tags&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;mirror&rsquo; action
makes or updates a local mirror of a Subversion or CVS repo.
It requires a single argument, either a Subversion URL or a
CVS URL, or the name of a local <br>
mirror directory created by a previous run. The first form
creates a local mirror of the repository in a directory
named after the last segment of the URL, with the suffix
<br>
&acirc;-mirror&acirc; (the local mirror name can be
overridden by an optional) second argument. The second form
updates the local mirror, doing an incremental fetch; just
give the mirror <br>
directory name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subversion URLs are as specified
in the public documentation for Subversion. CVS URLs must
specify a host and repository path, followed by a
&rsquo;#&rsquo;, followed by a module name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
This program uses the $TMPDIR environment variable,
defaulting to /tmp if it is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
The export action is a wrapper around either native export
facilities or the following engines: cvs-fast-export(1) (for
CVS), svnadmin(1) (for SVN), hg-fast-export.py(1) (for <br>
hg). You must have the appropriate engine in your $PATH for
whatever kind of repository you are streaming.</p>
