<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ci - check in RCS revisions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ci [options] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ci stores new revisions into RCS files. Each file name
matching an RCS suffix is taken to be an RCS file. All
others are assumed to be working files containing new
revisions. <br>
ci deposits the contents of each working file into the
corresponding RCS file. If only a working file is given, ci
tries to find the corresponding RCS file in an RCS
subdirec&acirc; <br>
tory and then in the working file&rsquo;s directory. For
more details, see FILE NAMING below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ci to work, the
caller&rsquo;s login must be on the access list, except if
the access list is empty or the caller is the superuser or
the owner of the file. To append a new revi&acirc; <br>
sion to an existing branch, the tip revision on that branch
must be locked by the caller. Otherwise, only a new branch
can be created. This restriction is not enforced for the
<br>
owner of the file if non-strict locking is used (see
rcs(1)). A lock held by someone else can be broken with the
rcs command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the -f option is given,
ci checks whether the revision to be deposited differs from
the preceding one. If not, instead of creating a new
revision ci reverts to the pre&acirc; <br>
ceding one. To revert, ordinary ci removes the working file
and any lock; ci -l keeps and ci -u removes any lock, and
then they both generate a new working file much as if co -l
<br>
or co -u had been applied to the preceding revision. When
reverting, any -n and -s options apply to the preceding
revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each revision deposited, ci
prompts for a log message. The log message should summarize
the change and must be terminated by end-of-file or by a
line containing . by itself. <br>
If several files are checked in ci asks whether to reuse the
previous log message. If the standard input is not a
terminal, ci suppresses the prompt and uses the same log
mes&acirc; <br>
sage for all files. See also -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the RCS file does not exist,
ci creates it and deposits the contents of the working file
as the initial revision (default number: 1.1). The access
list is initialized to <br>
empty. Instead of the log message, ci requests descriptive
text (see -t below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number rev of the deposited
revision can be given by any of the options -f, -i, -I, -j,
-k, -l, -M, -q, -r, or -u. rev can be symbolic, numeric, or
mixed. Symbolic names in <br>
rev must already be defined; see the -n and -N options for
assigning names during checkin. If rev is $, ci determines
the revision number from keyword values in the working <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rev begins with a period,
then the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to
it. If rev is a branch number followed by a period, then the
latest revision on that <br>
branch is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rev is a revision number, it
must be higher than the latest one on the branch to which
rev belongs, or must start a new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rev is a branch rather than a
revision number, the new revision is appended to that
branch. The level number is obtained by incrementing the tip
revision number of that <br>
branch. If rev indicates a non-existing branch, that branch
is created with the initial revision numbered rev.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rev is omitted, ci tries to
derive the new revision number from the caller&rsquo;s last
lock. If the caller has locked the tip revision of a branch,
the new revision is appended to <br>
that branch. The new revision number is obtained by
incrementing the tip revision number. If the caller locked a
non-tip revision, a new branch is started at that revision
by <br>
incrementing the highest branch number at that revision. The
default initial branch and level numbers are 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rev is omitted and the caller
has no lock, but owns the file and locking is not set to
strict, then the revision is appended to the default branch
(normally the trunk; see the <br>
-b option of rcs(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exception: On the trunk,
revisions can be appended to the end, but not inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-rrev Check in revision rev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r The bare -r option (without
any revision) has an unusual meaning in ci. With other RCS
commands, a bare -r option specifies the most recent
revision on the default <br>
branch, but with ci, a bare -r option reestablishes the
default behavior of releasing a lock and removing the
working file, and is used to override any default -l or -u
<br>
options established by shell aliases or scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[rev] <br>
works like -r, except it performs an additional co -l for
the deposited revision. Thus, the deposited revision is
immediately checked out again and locked. This is use&acirc;
<br>
ful for saving a revision although one wants to continue
editing it after the checkin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[rev] <br>
works like -l, except that the deposited revision is not
locked. This lets one read the working file immediately
after checkin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l, bare -r, and -u options
are mutually exclusive and silently override each other. For
example, ci -u -r is equivalent to ci -r because bare -r
overrides -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[rev] <br>
forces a deposit; the new revision is deposited even it is
not different from the preceding one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k[rev] <br>
searches the working file for keyword values to determine
its revision number, creation date, state, and author (see
co(1)), and assigns these values to the deposited <br>
revision, rather than computing them locally. It also
generates a default login message noting the login of the
caller and the actual checkin date. This option is useful
<br>
for software distribution. A revision that is sent to
several sites should be checked in with the -k option at
these sites to preserve the original number, date, author,
<br>
and state. The extracted keyword values and the default log
message can be overridden with the options -d, -m, -s, -w,
and any option that carries a revision number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q[rev] <br>
quiet mode; diagnostic output is not printed. A revision
that is not different from the preceding one is not
deposited, unless -f is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i[rev] <br>
initial checkin; report an error if the RCS file already
exists. This avoids race conditions in certain
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j[rev] <br>
just checkin and do not initialize; report an error if the
RCS file does not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[rev] <br>
interactive mode; the user is prompted and questioned even
if the standard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[date] <br>
uses date for the checkin date and time. The date is
specified in free format as explained in co(1). This is
useful for lying about the checkin date, and for -k if no
<br>
date is available. If date is empty, the working
file&rsquo;s time of last modification is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M[rev] <br>
Set the modification time on any new working file to be the
date of the retrieved revision. For example, ci -d -M -u f
does not alter f&rsquo;s modification time, even if
f&rsquo;s <br>
contents change due to keyword substitution. Use this option
with care; it can confuse make(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m[msg] <br>
uses the string msg as the log message for all revisions
checked in. If msg is omitted, it defaults to &quot;***
empty log message ***&quot;. By convention, log messages
that <br>
start with # are comments and are ignored by programs like
GNU Emacs&rsquo;s vc package. Also, log messages that start
with {clumpname} (followed by white space) are meant to <br>
be clumped together if possible, even if they are associated
with different files; the {clumpname} label is used only for
clumping, and is not considered to be part of the <br>
log message itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nname assigns the symbolic name
name to the number of the checked-in revision. ci prints an
error message if name is already assigned to another
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nname same as -n, except that
it overrides a previous assignment of name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sstate <br>
sets the state of the checked-in revision to the identifier
state. The default state is Exp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tfile writes descriptive text
from the contents of the named file into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text. The file cannot begin with
-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t-string <br>
Write descriptive text from the string into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option, in both its
forms, has effect only during an initial checkin; it is
silently ignored otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the initial checkin, if
-t is not given, ci obtains the text from standard input,
terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing . by
itself. The user is <br>
prompted for the text if interaction is possible; see
-I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility with
older versions of RCS, a bare -t option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Set the RCS file&rsquo;s
modification time to the new revision&rsquo;s time if the
former precedes the latter and there is a new revision;
preserve the RCS file&rsquo;s modification time <br>
otherwise. If you have locked a revision, ci usually updates
the RCS file&rsquo;s modification time to the current time,
because the lock is stored in the RCS file and removing <br>
the lock requires changing the RCS file. This can create an
RCS file newer than the working file in one of two ways:
first, ci -M can create a working file with a date <br>
before the current time; second, when reverting to the
previous revision the RCS file can change while the working
file remains unchanged. These two cases can cause <br>
excessive recompilation caused by a make(1) dependency of
the working file on the RCS file. The -T option inhibits
this recompilation by lying about the RCS file&rsquo;s date.
<br>
Use this option with care; it can suppress recompilation
even when a checkin of one working file should affect
another working file associated with the same RCS file. For
<br>
example, suppose the RCS file&rsquo;s time is 01:00, the
(changed) working file&rsquo;s time is 02:00, some other
copy of the working file has a time of 03:00, and the
current time is <br>
04:00. Then ci -d -T sets the RCS file&rsquo;s time to 02:00
instead of the usual 04:00; this causes make(1) to think
(incorrectly) that the other copy is newer than the RCS <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wlogin <br>
uses login for the author field of the deposited revision.
Useful for lying about the author, and for -k if no author
is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print RCS&rsquo;s version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vn Emulate RCS version n. See
co(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsuffixes <br>
specifies the suffixes for RCS files. A nonempty suffix
matches any file name ending in the suffix. An empty suffix
matches any file name of the form RCS/frag or <br>
frag1/RCS/frag2. The -x option can specify a list of
suffixes separated by /. For example, -x,v/ specifies two
suffixes: ,v and the empty suffix. If two or more suf&acirc;
<br>
fixes are specified, they are tried in order when looking
for an RCS file; the first one that works is used for that
file. If no RCS file is found but an RCS file can be <br>
created, the suffixes are tried in order to determine the
new RCS file&rsquo;s name. The default for suffixes is
installation-dependent; normally it is ,v/ for hosts like
Unix <br>
that permit commas in file names, and is empty (i.e. just
the empty suffix) for other hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zzone specifies the date output
format in keyword substitution, and specifies the default
time zone for date in the -ddate option. The zone should be
empty, a numeric UTC off&acirc; <br>
set, or the special string LT for local time. The default is
an empty zone, which uses the traditional RCS format of UTC
without any time zone indication and with slashes <br>
separating the parts of the date; otherwise, times are
output in ISO 8601 format with time zone indication. For
example, if local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific <br>
Standard Time, eight hours west of UTC, then the time is
output as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option time output <br>
-z 1990/01/12 04:00:00 (default) <br>
-zLT 1990-01-11 20:00:00-08 <br>
-z+05:30 1990-01-12 09:30:00+05:30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -z option does not affect
dates stored in RCS files, which are always UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAMING <br>
Pairs of RCS files and working files can be specified in
three ways (see also the example section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Both the RCS file and the
working file are given. The RCS file name is of the form
frag1/workfileX and the working file name is of the form
frag2/workfile where frag1/ and <br>
frag2/ are (possibly different or empty) file names,
workfile is a file name, and X is an RCS suffix. If X is
empty, frag1/ must start with RCS/ or must contain
/RCS/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Only the RCS file is given.
Then the working file is created in the current directory
and its name is derived from the RCS file name by removing
frag1/ and the suffix X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Only the working file is
given. Then ci considers each RCS suffix X in turn, looking
for an RCS file of the form frag2/RCS/workfileX or (if the
former is not found and X is <br>
nonempty) frag2/workfileX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the RCS file is specified
without a file name in 1) and 2), ci looks for the RCS file
first in the directory ./RCS and then in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ci reports an error if an
attempt to open an RCS file fails for an unusual reason,
even if the RCS file&rsquo;s name is just one of several
possibilities. For example, to suppress use <br>
of RCS commands in a directory d, create a regular file
named d/RCS so that casual attempts to use RCS commands in d
fail because d/RCS is not a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Suppose ,v is an RCS suffix and the current directory
contains a subdirectory RCS with an RCS file io.c,v. Then
each of the following commands check in a copy of io.c into
<br>
RCS/io.c,v as the latest revision, removing io.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ci io.c; ci RCS/io.c,v; ci
io.c,v; <br>
ci io.c RCS/io.c,v; ci io.c io.c,v; <br>
ci RCS/io.c,v io.c; ci io.c,v io.c;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose instead that the empty
suffix is an RCS suffix and the current directory contains a
subdirectory RCS with an RCS file io.c. The each of the
following commands checks in <br>
a new revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ci io.c; ci RCS/io.c; <br>
ci io.c RCS/io.c; <br>
ci RCS/io.c io.c;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE MODES <br>
An RCS file created by ci inherits the read and execute
permissions from the working file. If the RCS file exists
already, ci preserves its read and execute permissions. ci
<br>
always turns off all write permissions of RCS files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Temporary files are created in the directory containing the
working file, and also in the temporary directory (see
TMPDIR under ENVIRONMENT). A semaphore file or files are
cre&acirc; <br>
ated in the directory containing the RCS file. With a
nonempty suffix, the semaphore names begin with the first
character of the suffix; therefore, do not specify an suffix
<br>
whose first character could be that of a working file name.
With an empty suffix, the semaphore names end with _ so
working file names should not end in _.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ci never changes an RCS file or
working file. Normally, ci unlinks the file and creates a
new one; but instead of breaking a chain of one or more
symbolic links to an RCS file, <br>
it unlinks the destination file instead. Therefore, ci
breaks any hard or symbolic links to any working file it
changes; and hard links to RCS files are ineffective, but
sym&acirc; <br>
bolic links to RCS files are preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effective user must be able
to search and write the directory containing the RCS file.
Normally, the real user must be able to read the RCS and
working files and to search <br>
and write the directory containing the working file;
however, some older hosts cannot easily switch between real
and effective users, so on these hosts the effective user is
used <br>
for all accesses. The effective user is the same as the real
user unless your copies of ci and co have setuid privileges.
As described in the next section, these privileges <br>
yield extra security if the effective user owns all RCS
files and directories, and if only the effective user can
write RCS directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users can control access to RCS
files by setting the permissions of the directory containing
the files; only users with write access to the directory can
use RCS commands to <br>
change its RCS files. For example, in hosts that allow a
user to belong to several groups, one can make a
group&rsquo;s RCS directories writable to that group only.
This approach <br>
suffices for informal projects, but it means that any group
member can arbitrarily change the group&rsquo;s RCS files,
and can even remove them entirely. Hence more formal
projects <br>
sometimes distinguish between an RCS administrator, who can
change the RCS files at will, and other project members, who
can check in new revisions but cannot otherwise change <br>
the RCS files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUID USE <br>
To prevent anybody but their RCS administrator from deleting
revisions, a set of users can employ setuid privileges as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Check that the
host supports RCS setuid use. Consult a trustworthy expert
if there are any doubts. It is best if the seteuid system
call works as described in Posix 1003.1a <br>
Draft 5, because RCS can switch back and forth easily
between real and effective users, even if the real user is
root. If not, the second best is if the setuid system call
<br>
supports saved setuid (the {_POSIX_SAVED_IDS} behavior of
Posix 1003.1-1990); this fails only if the real or effective
user is root. If RCS detects any failure in setuid, it <br>
quits immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose a user A
to serve as RCS administrator for the set of users. Only A
can invoke the rcs command on the users&rsquo; RCS files. A
should not be root or any other user with <br>
special powers. Mutually suspicious sets of users should use
different administrators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose a file
name B to be a directory of files to be executed by the
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have A set up B
to contain copies of ci and co that are setuid to A by
copying the commands from their standard installation
directory D as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir B <br>
cp D/c[io] B <br>
chmod go-w,u+s B/c[io]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have each user
prepend B to their command search path as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH=B:$PATH; export PATH #
ordinary shell <br>
set path=(B $path) # C shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have A create
each RCS directory R with write access only to A as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir R <br>
chmod go-w R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you want to
let only certain users read the RCS files, put the users
into a group G, and have A further protect the RCS directory
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chgrp G R <br>
chmod g-w,o-rwx R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have A copy old
RCS files (if any) into R, to ensure that A owns them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An RCS
file&rsquo;s access list limits who can check in and lock
revisions. The default access list is empty, which grants
checkin access to anyone who can read the RCS file. If <br>
you want limit checkin access, have A invoke rcs -a on the
file; see rcs(1). In particular, rcs -e -aA limits access to
just A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have A
initialize any new RCS files with rcs -i before initial
checkin, adding the -a option if you want to limit checkin
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Give setuid
privileges only to ci, co, and rcsclean; do not give them to
rcs or to any other command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not use other
setuid commands to invoke RCS commands; setuid is trickier
than you think!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RCSINIT <br>
Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.
A backslash escapes spaces within an option. The RCSINIT
options are prepended to the argument lists of most <br>
RCS commands. Useful RCSINIT options include -q, -V, -x, and
-z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS_MEM_LIMIT <br>
An integer lim, measured in kilobytes, specifying the
threshold under which commands will try to use memory-based
operations for processing the RCS file. (For RCS files <br>
of size lim kilobytes or greater, RCS will use the slower
standard input/output routines.) Default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Name of the temporary
directory. If not set, the environment variables TMP and
TEMP are inspected instead and the first value found is
taken; if none of them are set, a <br>
host-dependent default is used, typically /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
For each revision, ci prints the RCS file, the working file,
and the number of both the deposited and the preceding
revision. The exit status is zero if and only if all
opera&acirc; <br>
tions were successful.</p>
