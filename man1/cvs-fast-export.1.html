<p>CVS-FAST-EXPORT(1) CVS-FAST-EXPORT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvs-fast-export - fast-export history from a CVS repository
or RCS collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvs-fast-export [-h] [-C] [-F] [-a] [-w fuzz] [-g] [-l] [-v]
[-q] [-V] [-T] [-p] [-P] [-i date] [-k expansion] [-A
authormap] [-t threads] [-R revmap] [--reposurgeon] [-e
remote] <br>
[-s stripprefix]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cvs-fast-export tries to group the per-file commits and tags
in a RCS file collection or CVS project repository into
per-project changeset commits with common metadata, in the
<br>
style of Subversion and later version-control systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tool is best used in
conjunction with reposurgeon(1). Plain cvs-fast-export
conversions contain various sorts of fossils that
reposurgeon is good for cleaning up. See the <br>
DVCS Migration HOWTO to learn about the sanity-checking and
polishing steps required for a really high-quality
conversion, including reference lifting and various sorts of
<br>
artifact cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arguments are supplied, the
program assumes all ending with the extension &quot;,v&quot;
are master files and reads them in. If no arguments are
supplied, the program reads filenames <br>
from stdin, one per line. Directories and files not ending
in &quot;,v&quot; are skipped. (But see the description of
the -P for how to change this behavior.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files from either Unix CVS or
CVS-NT are handled. If a collection of files has commitid
fields, changesets will be constructed reliably using
those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default mode, which
generates a git-style fast-export stream to standard
output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The prefix given
using the -s option or, if the option is omitted, the
longest common prefix of the paths is discarded from each
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Files in CVS
Attic and RCS directories are treated as though the
&quot;Attic/&quot; or &quot;RCS/&quot; portion of the path
were absent. This usually restores the history of files that
were <br>
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Permissions on
all fileops related to a particular file will be controlled
by the permissions on the corresponding master. If the
executable bit on the master is on, all its <br>
fileops will have 100755 permissions; otherwise 100644.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A set of file
operations is coalesced into a changeset if either (a) they
all share the same commitid, or (b) all have no commitid but
identical change comments, authors, and <br>
modification dates within the window defined by the
time-fuzz parameter. Unlike some other exporters, no attempt
is made to derive changesets from shared tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Commits are
issued in time order unless the cvs-fast-export detects that
some parent is younger than its child (this is unlikely but
possible in cases of severe clock skew). <br>
In that case you will see a warning on standard error and
the emission order is guaranteed topologically correct, but
otherwise not specified (and is subject to change in <br>
future versions of this program).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CVS tags become
git lightweight tags when they can be unambiguously
associated with a changeset. If the same tag is attached to
file deltas that resolve to multiple <br>
changesets, it is reported as if attached to the last of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The HEAD branch
is renamed to master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Other tag and
branch names are sanitized to be legal for git; the
characters ~^ are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Since .cvsignore
files have a syntax upward-compatible with that of
.gitignore files, they&acirc;re renamed. In order to
simulate the default ignore behavior of CVS, those defaults
<br>
are prepended to root .cvsignore blobs renamed to
.gitignore, and a root .gitignore containing the defaults is
generated if no such blobs exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the later section on RCS/CVS
LIMITATIONS for more information on edge cases and
conversion problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program does not depend on
any of the CVS metadata held outside the individual content
files (e.g. under CVSROOT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variable TMPDIR is honored
and used when generating a temporary directory in which to
store file content during processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program treats the file
contents of the source CVS or RCS repository, and their
filenames. as uninterpreted byte sequences to be passed
through to the git conversion without <br>
re-encoding. In particular, it makes no attempt to fix up ),
nor does it know vs. Macintosh line endings (Unix vs,
Windows about what repository filenames might collide <br>
with special filenames on any given platform. Optionally it
may expand CVS $-keywords, but this is not reecommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program treats change
comments as uninterpreted byte sequences to be passed
through to the git conversipn without change or re-encoding.
If you need to re-encode (e.g, from <br>
Latin-1 to UTF-8) or remap CVS version IDs to something
useful, use cvs-fast-export in conjuction with the transcode
and references lift commands of reposurgeon(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
Display usage summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w fuzz <br>
Set the timestamp fuzz factor for identifying patch sets in
seconds. The default is 300 seconds. This option is
irrelevant for changesets with commitids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Don&acirc;t trust commit-IDs; match by ordinary metatada.
Will be useful if you have something like a CVS-NT
repository in which per-file commits were made in such a way
that the <br>
cliques don&acirc;t have matching IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Specify RCS/CVS keyword expansion. You can specify any of
the CVS keyword expansion types: &quot;kv&quot;
(keyword-value), &quot;kvl&quot; (keyword-value-locker),
&quot;k&quot; (keyword only), &quot;v&quot; (value <br>
only), &quot;o&quot; (no expansion), or &quot;b&quot;
(binary - no exansion, no line ending conversion).
CVS&acirc;s rules are: (1) if the master has -kb set in its
internal keyword field, do that, <br>
otherwise (2) if an expansion type was set on the command
line, do that, otherwise (3) if the file&acirc;s internal
keyword field is set, do that, otherwise use kv.
cvs-fast-export <br>
behaves slightly differently; the default is kb rather than
kkv, kvl is treated like kv, and ko is treated like kb (that
is, no end-of-line normalization is ever performed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
generate a picture of the commit graph in the DOT markup
language used by the graphviz tools, rather than
fast-exporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Warnings normally go to standard error. This option, which
takes a filename, allows you to redirect them to a file&gt;
Convenient with the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
Dump a list of author IDs found in the repository, rather
than fast-exporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
Force canonical order (same as git-fast-export&acirc;s) in
the emitted stream. Blobs are emitted as late as possible
before the commits that require them. It reduces throughput
by <br>
about a factor of two. Repositories in which the time order
of commits is inconsistent with their topological order will
produce malformed fast-export streams in -C mode; <br>
these will crash Git&acirc;s importer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
Force fast order. Blobs are emitted first, then commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A authormap <br>
Apply an author-map file to the attribution lines. Each line
must be of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ferd = Ferd J. Foonly
&lt;foonly@foo.com&gt; America/Chicago</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and will be applied to map the
Unix username ferd to the DVCS-style user identity specified
after the equals sign. The timezone field (after &gt; and
whitespace) is optional and <br>
(if present) is used to set the timezone offset to be
attached to the date; acceptable formats for the timezone
field are anything that can be in the TZ environment
variable, <br>
including a [+-]hhmm offset. Whitespace around the equals
sign is stripped. Lines beginning with a # or not containing
an equals sign are silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R revmap <br>
Write a revision map to the specified argument filename.
Each line of the revision map consists of three
whitespace-separated fields: a filename, an RCS revision
number, and <br>
the mark of the commit to which that filename-revision pair
was assigned. Doesn&acirc;t work with -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Show verbose progress messages mainly of interest to
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Run quietly, suppressing warning messages about absence of
commitids and other minor problems for which the program can
usually compensate but which may indicate conversion <br>
problems. Meant to be used with cvsconvert, which does its
own correctness checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T <br>
Force deterministic dates for regression testing. Each
patchset will have a monotonic-increasing attributed date
computed from its mark in the output stream - the mark value
<br>
times the commit time window times two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reposurgeon <br>
Emit for each commit a list of the CVS file:revision pairs
composing it as a bzr-style commit property named
&quot;cvs-revisions&quot;. From version 2.12 onward,
reposurgeon(1) can <br>
interpret these and use them as hints for
reference-lifting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--embed-id <br>
Append to each commit comment identification of the CVS
commits that contributed to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Emit the program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e remote <br>
Exported branch names are prefixed with refs/remotes/remote
instead of refs/heads, making the import appear to come from
the named remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s stripprefix <br>
Strip the given prefix instead of longest common prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t threadcount <br>
Running multithreaded increases the program&acirc;s memory
footprint proportionally to the number of threads, but means
the conversion may run in less total time because an I/O
<br>
operation involving one master file will not block
compute-intensive processing of others. By default, the
program conservatively assumes it can use two threads per
processor <br>
available. You can use this option to set the number of
threads; the value 0 forces sequential processing with no
threading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
Enable progress reporting. This also dumps statistics
(elapsed time and size of maximum resident set) for several
points in the conversion run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
Normally cvs-fast-export will skip any filename presented as
an argument or on stdin that does not end with the RCS/CVS
extension &quot;,v&quot;, and will also ignore a pathnamre
<br>
containing the string CVSROOT (this avoids annoyances when
running from or above a top-level CVS directory). A strict
reading of RCS allows masters without the ,v extension. <br>
This option sets promiscuous mode, disabling both
checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i date <br>
Enable incremental-dump mode. Only commits with a date after
that specified by the argument are emitted. Each branch root
in the incremental dump is decorated with git-stream <br>
magic which, when interpreted in context of a live
repository, will connect that branch to any branch of the
same name. The date is expected to be RFC3339 conformant
(e.g. <br>
yy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ) or else an integer Unix time in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -F nor -C is
specified, cvs-fast-export will choose a mode based on the
repository size - canonical order for small repositories,
fast for large ones. Tools that <br>
consume git-fast-import streams should not care; this
behavior is for backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
A very typical invocation would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . | cvs-fast-export
&gt;stream.fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your cvs-fast-export
distribution should also supply cvssync(1), a tool for
fetching CVS masters from a remote repository. Using them
together will look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvssync
anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/groff groff <br>
find groff | cvs-fast-export &gt;groff.fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Progress reporting can be
reassuring if you expect a conversion to run for some time.
It will animate completion percentages as the conversion
proceeds and display timings when <br>
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cvs-fast-export suite
contains a wrapper script called cvsconvert that is useful
for running a conversion and automatically checking its
content against the CVS original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS/CVS LIMITATIONS <br>
Translating RCS/CVS repositories to the generic DVCS model
expressed by import streams is not merely difficult and
messy, there are weird RCS/CVS cases that cannot be
correctly <br>
translated at all. cvs-fast-export will try to warn you
about these cases rather than silently producing broken or
incomplete translations, but there be dragons. We recommend
<br>
some precautions under SANITY CHECKING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVS-NT and versions of GNU CVS
after 1.12 (2004) added a changeset commit-id to file
metadata. Older sections of CVS history without these are
vulnerable to various problems <br>
caused by clock skew between clients; this used to be
relatively common for multiple reasons, including less
pervasive use of NTP clock synchronization. cvs-fast-export
will warn <br>
you (&quot;commits before this date lack commitids&quot;)
when it sees such a section in your history. When it does,
these caveats apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If timestamps of
commits in the CVS repository were not stable enough to be
used for ordering commits, changes may be reported in the
wrong order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the timestamp
order of different files crosses the revision order within
the commit-matching time window, the order of commits
reported may be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One more property affected by
commitids is the stability of old changesets under
incremental dumping. Under a CVS implementation issuing
commitids, new CVS commits are guaranteed <br>
not to change cvs-fast-export&acirc;s changeset derivation
from a previous history; thus, updating a target DVCS
repository with incremental dumps from a live CVS
installation will <br>
work. Even if older portions of the history do not have
commitids, conversions will be stable. This stability
guarantee is lost if you are using a version of CVS that
does not <br>
issue commitids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that a CVS repository
has to be completely reanalyzed even for incremental dumps;
thus, processing time and memory requirements will rise with
the total repository size <br>
even when the requested reporting interval of the
incremental dump is small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These problems cannot be fixed
in cvs-fast-export; they are inherent to CVS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVS-FAST-EXPORT REQUIREMENTS AND
LIMITATIONS <br>
Because the code is designed for dealing with large data
sets, it has been optimized for 64-bit machines and no
particular effort has been made to keep it 32-bit clean.
Various <br>
counters may overflow if you try using it to lift a large
repository on a 32-bit machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Branches occurring in only a
subset of the analyzed masters are not correctly resolved;
instead, an entirely disjoint history will be created
containing the branch revisions and <br>
all parents back to the root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVS vendor branches are a source
of trouble. Sufficiently strange combinations of imports and
local modifications will translate badly, producing
incorrect content on master and <br>
elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some other CVS exporters try, or
have tried, to deduce changesets from shared tags even when
comment metadata doesn&acirc;t match perfectly. This one
does not; the designers judge that <br>
to trip over too many pathological CVS tagging cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program does try to do
something useful cases in which a tag occurs in a set of
revisions that does not correspond to any gitspace commit.
In this case a tagged branch <br>
containing only one commit is created, guaranteeing that you
can check out a set of files containing the CVS content for
the tag. The root of the branchlet is the gitspace commit
<br>
where the latest CVS revision in in the tagged set first
occurs; this is the commit the tag would point at if its
incompleteness were ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running multithreaded,
there is an edge case in which the program&acirc;s behavior
is nondeterministic. If the same tag looks like it should be
assigned to two different gitspace <br>
commits with the same timestamp, which tag it actually lands
on will be random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs-fast-export is designed to
do translation with all its intermediate structures in
memory, in one pass. This contrasts with cvs2git(1), which
uses multiple passes and journals <br>
intermediate structures to disk. The tradeoffs are that
cvs-fast-export is much faster than cvs2git, but will fail
with an out-of-memory error on CVS repositories large enough
to <br>
overflow your physical memory. In practice, you are unlikely
to push this limit on a machine with 32GB of RAM and
effectively certain not to with 64GB. Attempts to do large
<br>
conversions in only a 32-bit (4GB) address space are, on the
other hand, unlikely to end well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program&acirc;s transient
storage requirements can be quite a bit larger; it must
slurp in each entire master file once in order to do delta
assembly and generate the version <br>
snapshots that will become snapshots. Using the -t option
multiplies the expected amount of transient storage required
by the number of threads; use with care, as it is easy to
<br>
push memory usage so high that swap overhead overwhelms the
gains from not constantly blocking on I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In -C mode, the program also
requires temporary disk space equivalent to the sum of the
sizes of all revisions in all files. This is not so in -F
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On stock PC hardware in 2014,
cvs-fast-export achieves processing speeds upwards of 64K
CVS commits per minute on real repositories. Time
performance is primarily I/O bound and <br>
can be improved by running on an SSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SANITY CHECKING <br>
After conversion, it is good practice to do the following
verification steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If you ran the conversion
directly with cvs-fast-export rather than using cvsconvert,
use diff(1) with the -r option to compare a CVS head
checkout with a checkout of the <br>
converted repository. The only differences you should see
are those due to RCS keyword expansion, .cvsignore lifting,
and manifest mismatches due to CVS not tracking file <br>
deaths quite correctly. If this is not true, you may have
found a bug in cvs-fast-export; please report it with a copy
of the CVS repo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Examine the translated
repository with reposurgeon(1) looking (in particular) for
misplaced tags or branch joins. Often these can be manually
repaired with little effort. <br>
These flaws do not necessarily imply bugs in
cvs-fast-export; they may simply indicate previously
undetected malformations in the CVS history. However,
reporting them may <br>
help improve cvs-fast-export.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above is an abbreviated
version of part of DVCS Migration HOWTO; browse it for
more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
0 if all files were found and successfully converted, 1
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR MESSAGES <br>
Most of the messages cvs-fast-export emits are
self.explanatory. Here are a few that aren&acirc;t. Where it
says &quot;check head&quot;, be sure to sanity-check against
the head revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag could not be assigned to a
commit <br>
RCS/CVS tags are per-file, not per revision. If developers
are not careful in their use of tagging, it can be
impossible to associate a tag with any of the changesets
that <br>
cvs-fast-export resolves. When this happens, cvs-fast-export
will issue this warning and the tag named will be
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">child commit emitted before
parent <br>
Something went wrong diring export canonicalization. This
was probably caused by CVS commit timestamps being in the
wrong order for their parent-child relathonship. Try the
<br>
-F option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discarding dead untagged branch
<br>
Analysis found a CVS branch with no tag consisting entirely
of dead revisions. These cannot have been visible in the
archival state of the CVS at conversion time; it is <br>
possible they may have been visible as branch content at
some point in the repository&acirc;s past, but without an
identifying tag that state is impossible to reconstruct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning - unnamed branch <br>
A CVS branch with a live revision lacks a head label. A
label with &quot;-UNNAMED-BRANCH&quot; suffixed to the name
of the parent branch will be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning - no master branch
generated <br>
cvs-fast-export could not identify the default (HEAD) branch
and therefore there is no &quot;master&quot; in the
conversion; this will seriously confuse git and probably
other VCSes <br>
when they try to import the output stream. You may be able
to identify and rename a master branch using
reposurgeon(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning - xxx newer than yyy
<br>
Early in analysis of a CVS master file, time sort order of
its deltas doesn&acirc;t match the topological order defined
by the revision numbers. The most likely cause of this is
<br>
clock skew between clients in very old CVS versions. The
program will attempt to correct for this by tweaking the
revision date of the out-of-order commit to be that of its
<br>
parent, but this may not prevent other time-skew errors
later in analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning - skew_vulnerable in
file xxx rev yyy set to zzz <br>
This warning is emitted when verbose is on and only on
commits with no commit ID. It calls out commits that coause
the date before which coalescence is unreliable to be set
<br>
forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tip commit older than imputed
branch join <br>
A similar problem to &quot;newer than&quot; being reported
at a later stage, when file branches are being knit into
changeset branches. One CVS branch in a collection about to
be <br>
merged into a gitspace branch has a tip commit older than
the earliest commit that is a a parent on some (other) tip
in the collection. The adventious branch is snipped off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">some parent commits are younger
than children <br>
May indicate that cvs-fast-export aggregated some changesets
in the wrong order; probably harmless, but check head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning - branch point later
than branch <br>
Late in the analysis, when connecting branches to their
parents in the changeset DAG, the commit date of the root
commit of a branch is earlier than the date of the parent it
<br>
gets connected to. Could be yet another clock-skew symptom,
or might point to an error in the program&acirc;s
topological analysis. Examine commits near the join with
<br>
reposurgeon(1); the branch may need to be reparented by
hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more than one delta with number
X.Y.Z <br>
The CVS history contained duplicate file delta numbers.
Should never happen, and may indice a corrupted CVS archive
if it does; check head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{revision|patch} with odd depth
<br>
Should never happen; only branch numbers are supposed to
have odd depth, not file delta or patch numbers. May
indicate a corrupted CVS archive; check head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate tag in CVS master,
ignoring <br>
A CVS master has multiple instances of the same tag pointing
at different file deltas. Probably a CVS operator error and
relatively harmless, but check that the tag&acirc;s <br>
referent in the conversion makes sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag or branch name was empty
after sanitization <br>
Fatal error: tag name was empty after all characters illegal
for git were removed. Probably indicates a corrupted RCS
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revision number too long,
increase CVS_MAX_DEPTH <br>
Fatal error: internal buffers are too short to handle a CVS
revision in a repo. Increase this constant in cvs.h and
rebuild. Warning: this will increase memory usage and slow
<br>
down the tests a lot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapshot sequence number too
large, widen serial_t <br>
Fatal error: the number of file snapshots in the CVS repo
overruns an internal counter. Rebuild cvs-fast-export from
source with a wider serial_t patched into cvs.h. Warning:
<br>
this will significantly increase the working-set size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">too many branches, widen
branchcount_t <br>
Fatal error: the number of branches descended from some
single commit overruns an nternal counter. Rebuild
cvs-fast-export from source with a wider branchcount_t
patched into <br>
cvs.h. Warning: this will significantly increase the
working-set size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">corrupt delta in <br>
The text of a delta is expected to be led with d (delete)
and a (append) lines describing line-oriented changes at
that delta. When you see this message, these are absent or

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal error - branch cycle
<br>
cvs-fast-export found a cycle while topologically sorting
commits by parent link. This should never happen and
probably indicates a serious internal error: please file a
bug <br>
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal error - lost tag <br>
Late in analysis (after changeset coalescence) a tag lost
its commit reference. This should never happen and probably
indicates an internal error: please file a bug report.</p>
