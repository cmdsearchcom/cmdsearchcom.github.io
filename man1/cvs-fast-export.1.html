cvs-fast-export - fast-export history from a CVS repository or RCS collection.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
cvs-fast-export tries to group the per-file commits and tags in a RCS file
  collection or CVS project repository into per-project changeset commits with
  common metadata, in the style of Subversion and later version-control systems.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This tool is best used in conjunction with reposurgeon(1). Plain cvs-fast-export
  conversions contain various sorts of fossils that reposurgeon is good for
  cleaning up. See the DVCS Migration HOWTO to learn about the sanity-checking
  and polishing steps required for a really high-quality conversion, including
  reference lifting and various sorts of artifact cleanup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If arguments are supplied, the program assumes all ending with the extension
  &quot;,v&quot; are master files and reads them in. If no arguments are
  supplied, the program reads filenames from stdin, one per line. Directories
  and files not ending in &quot;,v&quot; are skipped. (But see the description
  of the -P for how to change this behavior.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Files from either Unix CVS or CVS-NT are handled. If a collection of files has
  commitid fields, changesets will be constructed reliably using those.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In the default mode, which generates a git-style fast-export stream to standard
  output:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;The prefix given using the -s option
  or, if the option is omitted, the longest common prefix of the paths is
  discarded from each path.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Files in CVS Attic and RCS directories
  are treated as though the &quot;Attic/&quot; or &quot;RCS/&quot; portion of
  the path were absent. This usually restores the history of files that were
  deleted.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Permissions on all fileops related to
  a particular file will be controlled by the permissions on the corresponding
  master. If the executable bit on the master is on, all its fileops will have
  100755 permissions; otherwise 100644.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;A set of file operations is coalesced
  into a changeset if either (a) they all share the same commitid, or (b) all
  have no commitid but identical change comments, authors, and modification
  dates within the window defined by the time-fuzz parameter. Unlike some other
  exporters, no attempt is made to derive changesets from shared tags.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Commits are issued in time order
  unless the cvs-fast-export detects that some parent is younger than its child
  (this is unlikely but possible in cases of severe clock skew). In that case
  you will see a warning on standard error and the emission order is guaranteed
  topologically correct, but otherwise not specified (and is subject to change
  in future versions of this program).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;CVS tags become git lightweight tags
  when they can be unambiguously associated with a changeset. If the same tag is
  attached to file deltas that resolve to multiple changesets, it is reported as
  if attached to the last of them.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;The HEAD branch is renamed to
  <i>master</i>.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Other tag and branch names are
  sanitized to be legal for git; the characters ~^\*? are removed.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Since .cvsignore files have a syntax
  upward-compatible with that of .gitignore files, they&#x2019;re renamed. In
  order to simulate the default ignore behavior of CVS, those defaults are
  prepended to root .cvsignore blobs renamed to .gitignore, and a root
  .gitignore containing the defaults is generated if no such blobs exist.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See the later section on RCS/CVS LIMITATIONS for more information on edge cases
  and conversion problems.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This program does not depend on any of the CVS metadata held outside the
  individual content files (e.g. under CVSROOT).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The variable TMPDIR is honored and used when generating a temporary directory in
  which to store file content during processing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This program treats the file contents of the source CVS or RCS repository, and
  their filenames. as uninterpreted byte sequences to be passed through to the
  git conversion without re-encoding. In particular, it makes no attempt to fix
  up line endings (Unix \n vs, Windows \r\n vs. Macintosh \r), nor does it know
  about what repository filenames might collide with special filenames on any
  given platform. Optionally it may expand CVS $-keywords, but this is not
  reecommended.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This program treats change comments as uninterpreted byte sequences to be passed
  through to the git conversipn without change or re-encoding. If you need to
  re-encode (e.g, from Latin-1 to UTF-8) or remap CVS version IDs to something
  useful, use cvs-fast-export in conjuction with the <i>transcode</i> and
  <i>references lift</i> commands of reposurgeon(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
-h
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display usage summary.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-w <i>fuzz</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the timestamp fuzz factor for identifying
  patch sets in seconds. The default is 300 seconds. This option is irrelevant
  for changesets with commitids.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-c
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Don&#x2019;t trust commit-IDs; match by
  ordinary metatada. Will be useful if you have something like a CVS-NT
  repository in which per-file commits were made in such a way that the cliques
  don&#x2019;t have matching IDs.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-k
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specify RCS/CVS keyword expansion. You can
  specify any of the CVS keyword expansion types: &quot;kv&quot;
  (keyword-value), &quot;kvl&quot; (keyword-value-locker), &quot;k&quot;
  (keyword only), &quot;v&quot; (value only), &quot;o&quot; (no expansion), or
  &quot;b&quot; (binary - no exansion, no line ending conversion). CVS&#x2019;s
  rules are: (1) if the master has -kb set in its internal keyword field, do
  that, otherwise (2) if an expansion type was set on the command line, do that,
  otherwise (3) if the file&#x2019;s internal keyword field is set, do that,
  otherwise use kv. cvs-fast-export behaves slightly differently; the default is
  kb rather than kkv, kvl is treated like kv, and ko is treated like kb (that
  is, no end-of-line normalization is ever performed).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-g
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">generate a picture of the commit graph in the
  DOT markup language used by the graphviz tools, rather than
  fast-exporting.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-l
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Warnings normally go to standard error. This
  option, which takes a filename, allows you to redirect them to a file&gt;
  Convenient with the -p option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-a
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Dump a list of author IDs found in the
  repository, rather than fast-exporting.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-C
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force canonical order (same as
  git-fast-export&#x2019;s) in the emitted stream. Blobs are emitted as late as
  possible before the commits that require them. It reduces throughput by about
  a factor of two. Repositories in which the time order of commits is
  inconsistent with their topological order will produce malformed fast-export
  streams in -C mode; these will crash Git&#x2019;s importer.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-F
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force fast order. Blobs are emitted first,
  then commits.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-A <i>authormap</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Apply an author-map file to the attribution
  lines. Each line must be of the form
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
ferd = Ferd J. Foonly &lt;foonly@foo.com&gt; America/Chicago
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and will be applied to map the Unix username <i>ferd</i> to the DVCS-style user
  identity specified after the equals sign. The timezone field (after &gt; and
  whitespace) is optional and (if present) is used to set the timezone offset to
  be attached to the date; acceptable formats for the timezone field are
  anything that can be in the TZ environment variable, including a [+-]hhmm
  offset. Whitespace around the equals sign is stripped. Lines beginning with a
  # or not containing an equals sign are silently ignored.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-R <i>revmap</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write a revision map to the specified argument
  filename. Each line of the revision map consists of three whitespace-separated
  fields: a filename, an RCS revision number, and the mark of the commit to
  which that filename-revision pair was assigned. Doesn&#x2019;t work with
  -g.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-v
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show verbose progress messages mainly of
  interest to developers.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-q
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Run quietly, suppressing warning messages
  about absence of commitids and other minor problems for which the program can
  usually compensate but which may indicate conversion problems. Meant to be
  used with cvsconvert, which does its own correctness checking.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-T
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force deterministic dates for regression
  testing. Each patchset will have a monotonic-increasing attributed date
  computed from its mark in the output stream - the mark value times the commit
  time window times two.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--reposurgeon
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Emit for each commit a list of the CVS
  file:revision pairs composing it as a bzr-style commit property named
  &quot;cvs-revisions&quot;. From version 2.12 onward, reposurgeon(1) can
  interpret these and use them as hints for reference-lifting.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--embed-id
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Append to each commit comment identification
  of the CVS commits that contributed to it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-V
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Emit the program version and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-e <i>remote</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Exported branch names are prefixed with
  refs/remotes/ <i>remote</i> instead of refs/heads, making the import appear to
  come from the named remote.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-s <i>stripprefix</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Strip the given prefix instead of longest
  common prefix</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-t <i>threadcount</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Running multithreaded increases the
  program&#x2019;s memory footprint proportionally to the number of threads, but
  means the conversion may run in less total time because an I/O operation
  involving one master file will not block compute-intensive processing of
  others. By default, the program conservatively assumes it can use two threads
  per processor available. You can use this option to set the number of threads;
  the value 0 forces sequential processing with no threading.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-p
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable progress reporting. This also dumps
  statistics (elapsed time and size of maximum resident set) for several points
  in the conversion run.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-P
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally cvs-fast-export will skip any
  filename presented as an argument or on stdin that does not end with the
  RCS/CVS extension &quot;,v&quot;, and will also ignore a pathnamre containing
  the string CVSROOT (this avoids annoyances when running from or above a
  top-level CVS directory). A strict reading of RCS allows masters without the
  ,v extension. This option sets promiscuous mode, disabling both checks.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-i <i>date</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enable incremental-dump mode. Only commits
  with a date after that specified by the argument are emitted. Each branch root
  in the incremental dump is decorated with git-stream magic which, when
  interpreted in context of a live repository, will connect that branch to any
  branch of the same name. The date is expected to be RFC3339 conformant (e.g.
  yy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ) or else an integer Unix time in seconds.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If neither -F nor -C is specified, cvs-fast-export will choose a mode based on
  the repository size - canonical order for small repositories, fast for large
  ones. Tools that consume git-fast-import streams should not care; this
  behavior is for backward compatibility.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
A very typical invocation would look like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
find . | cvs-fast-export &gt;stream.fi
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Your cvs-fast-export distribution should also supply cvssync(1), a tool for
  fetching CVS masters from a remote repository. Using them together will look
  something like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
cvssync anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/groff groff
find groff | cvs-fast-export &gt;groff.fi
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Progress reporting can be reassuring if you expect a conversion to run for some
  time. It will animate completion percentages as the conversion proceeds and
  display timings when done.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The cvs-fast-export suite contains a wrapper script called <i>cvsconvert</i>
  that is useful for running a conversion and automatically checking its content
  against the CVS original.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RCS/CVS_LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RCS/CVS_LIMITATIONS">RCS/CVS
  LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
Translating RCS/CVS repositories to the generic DVCS model expressed by import
  streams is not merely difficult and messy, there are weird RCS/CVS cases that
  cannot be correctly translated at all. cvs-fast-export will try to warn you
  about these cases rather than silently producing broken or incomplete
  translations, but there be dragons. We recommend some precautions under SANITY
  CHECKING.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
CVS-NT and versions of GNU CVS after 1.12 (2004) added a changeset commit-id to
  file metadata. Older sections of CVS history without these are vulnerable to
  various problems caused by clock skew between clients; this used to be
  relatively common for multiple reasons, including less pervasive use of NTP
  clock synchronization. cvs-fast-export will warn you (&quot;commits before
  this date lack commitids&quot;) when it sees such a section in your history.
  When it does, these caveats apply:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If timestamps of commits in the CVS
  repository were not stable enough to be used for ordering commits, changes may
  be reported in the wrong order.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;If the timestamp order of different
  files crosses the revision order within the commit-matching time window, the
  order of commits reported may be wrong.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One more property affected by commitids is the stability of old changesets under
  incremental dumping. Under a CVS implementation issuing commitids, new CVS
  commits are guaranteed not to change cvs-fast-export&#x2019;s changeset
  derivation from a previous history; thus, updating a target DVCS repository
  with incremental dumps from a live CVS installation will work. Even if older
  portions of the history do not have commitids, conversions will be stable.
  This stability guarantee is lost if you are using a version of CVS that does
  not issue commitids.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also note that a CVS repository has to be completely reanalyzed even for
  incremental dumps; thus, processing time and memory requirements will rise
  with the total repository size even when the requested reporting interval of
  the incremental dump is small.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These problems cannot be fixed in cvs-fast-export; they are inherent to CVS.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVS-FAST-EXPORT_REQUIREMENTS_AND_LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#CVS-FAST-EXPORT_REQUIREMENTS_AND_LIMITATIONS">CVS-FAST-EXPORT
  REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
Because the code is designed for dealing with large data sets, it has been
  optimized for 64-bit machines and no particular effort has been made to keep
  it 32-bit clean. Various counters may overflow if you try using it to lift a
  large repository on a 32-bit machine.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Branches occurring in only a subset of the analyzed masters are not correctly
  resolved; instead, an entirely disjoint history will be created containing the
  branch revisions and all parents back to the root.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
CVS vendor branches are a source of trouble. Sufficiently strange combinations
  of imports and local modifications will translate badly, producing incorrect
  content on master and elsewhere.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some other CVS exporters try, or have tried, to deduce changesets from shared
  tags even when comment metadata doesn&#x2019;t match perfectly. This one does
  not; the designers judge that to trip over too many pathological CVS tagging
  cases.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program does try to do something useful cases in which a tag occurs in a set
  of revisions that does not correspond to any gitspace commit. In this case a
  tagged branch containing only one commit is created, guaranteeing that you can
  check out a set of files containing the CVS content for the tag. The root of
  the branchlet is the gitspace commit where the latest CVS revision in in the
  tagged set first occurs; this is the commit the tag would point at if its
  incompleteness were ignored.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When running multithreaded, there is an edge case in which the program&#x2019;s
  behavior is nondeterministic. If the same tag looks like it should be assigned
  to two different gitspace commits with the same timestamp, which tag it
  actually lands on will be random.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
cvs-fast-export is designed to do translation with all its intermediate
  structures in memory, in one pass. This contrasts with cvs2git(1), which uses
  multiple passes and journals intermediate structures to disk. The tradeoffs
  are that cvs-fast-export is much faster than cvs2git, but will fail with an
  out-of-memory error on CVS repositories large enough to overflow your physical
  memory. In practice, you are unlikely to push this limit on a machine with
  32GB of RAM and effectively certain not to with 64GB. Attempts to do large
  conversions in only a 32-bit (4GB) address space are, on the other hand,
  unlikely to end well.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program&#x2019;s transient storage requirements can be quite a bit larger;
  it must slurp in each entire master file once in order to do delta assembly
  and generate the version snapshots that will become snapshots. Using the -t
  option multiplies the expected amount of transient storage required by the
  number of threads; use with care, as it is easy to push memory usage so high
  that swap overhead overwhelms the gains from not constantly blocking on I/O.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In -C mode, the program also requires temporary disk space equivalent to the sum
  of the sizes of all revisions in all files. This is not so in -F mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On stock PC hardware in 2014, cvs-fast-export achieves processing speeds upwards
  of 64K CVS commits per minute on real repositories. Time performance is
  primarily I/O bound and can be improved by running on an SSD.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SANITY_CHECKING"><a class="selflink" href="#SANITY_CHECKING">SANITY

After conversion, it is good practice to do the following verification steps:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.If you ran the conversion directly with
  cvs-fast-export rather than using cvsconvert, use diff(1) with the -r option
  to compare a CVS head checkout with a checkout of the converted repository.
  The only differences you should see are those due to RCS keyword expansion,
  .cvsignore lifting, and manifest mismatches due to CVS not tracking file
  deaths quite correctly. If this is not true, you may have found a bug in
  cvs-fast-export; please report it with a copy of the CVS repo.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.Examine the translated repository with
  reposurgeon(1) looking (in particular) for misplaced tags or branch joins.
  Often these can be manually repaired with little effort. These flaws do
  <i>not</i> necessarily imply bugs in cvs-fast-export; they may simply indicate
  previously undetected malformations in the CVS history. However, reporting
  them may help improve cvs-fast-export.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN

0 if all files were found and successfully converted, 1 otherwise.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ERROR_MESSAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#ERROR_MESSAGES">ERROR
  MESSAGES</a></h1>
Most of the messages cvs-fast-export emits are self.explanatory. Here are a few
  that aren&#x2019;t. Where it says &quot;check head&quot;, be sure to
  sanity-check against the head revision.
<div class="Pp"></div>
tag could not be assigned to a commit
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">RCS/CVS tags are per-file, not per revision.
  If developers are not careful in their use of tagging, it can be impossible to
  associate a tag with any of the changesets that cvs-fast-export resolves. When
  this happens, cvs-fast-export will issue this warning and the tag named will
  be discarded.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
child commit emitted before parent
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Something went wrong diring export
  canonicalization. This was probably caused by CVS commit timestamps being in
  the wrong order for their parent-child relathonship. Try the -F option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
discarding dead untagged branch
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Analysis found a CVS branch with no tag
  consisting entirely of dead revisions. These cannot have been visible in the
  archival state of the CVS at conversion time; it is possible they may have
  been visible as branch content at some point in the repository&#x2019;s past,
  but without an identifying tag that state is impossible to reconstruct.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
warning - unnamed branch
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A CVS branch with a live revision lacks a head
  label. A label with &quot;-UNNAMED-BRANCH&quot; suffixed to the name of the
  parent branch will be generated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
warning - no master branch generated
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">cvs-fast-export could not identify the default
  (HEAD) branch and therefore there is no &quot;master&quot; in the conversion;
  this will seriously confuse git and probably other VCSes when they try to
  import the output stream. You may be able to identify and rename a master
  branch using reposurgeon(1).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
warning - xxx newer than yyy
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Early in analysis of a CVS master file, time
  sort order of its deltas doesn&#x2019;t match the topological order defined by
  the revision numbers. The most likely cause of this is clock skew between
  clients in very old CVS versions. The program will attempt to correct for this
  by tweaking the revision date of the out-of-order commit to be that of its
  parent, but this may not prevent other time-skew errors later in
  analysis.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
warning - skew_vulnerable in file xxx rev yyy set to zzz
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This warning is emitted when verbose is on and
  only on commits with no commit ID. It calls out commits that coause the date
  before which coalescence is unreliable to be set forward.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
tip commit older than imputed branch join
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A similar problem to &quot;newer than&quot;
  being reported at a later stage, when file branches are being knit into
  changeset branches. One CVS branch in a collection about to be merged into a
  gitspace branch has a tip commit older than the earliest commit that is a a
  parent on some (other) tip in the collection. The adventious branch is snipped
  off.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
some parent commits are younger than children
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">May indicate that cvs-fast-export aggregated
  some changesets in the wrong order; probably harmless, but check head.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
warning - branch point later than branch
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Late in the analysis, when connecting branches
  to their parents in the changeset DAG, the commit date of the root commit of a
  branch is earlier than the date of the parent it gets connected to. Could be
  yet another clock-skew symptom, or might point to an error in the
  program&#x2019;s topological analysis. Examine commits near the join with
  reposurgeon(1); the branch may need to be reparented by hand.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
more than one delta with number X.Y.Z
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The CVS history contained duplicate file delta
  numbers. Should never happen, and may indice a corrupted CVS archive if it
  does; check head.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
{revision|patch} with odd depth
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Should never happen; only branch numbers are
  supposed to have odd depth, not file delta or patch numbers. May indicate a
  corrupted CVS archive; check head.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
duplicate tag in CVS master, ignoring
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A CVS master has multiple instances of the
  same tag pointing at different file deltas. Probably a CVS operator error and
  relatively harmless, but check that the tag&#x2019;s referent in the
  conversion makes sense.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
tag or branch name was empty after sanitization
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Fatal error: tag name was empty after all
  characters illegal for git were removed. Probably indicates a corrupted RCS
  file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
revision number too long, increase CVS_MAX_DEPTH
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Fatal error: internal buffers are too short to
  handle a CVS revision in a repo. Increase this constant in cvs.h and rebuild.
  Warning: this will increase memory usage and slow down the tests a lot.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
snapshot sequence number too large, widen serial_t
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Fatal error: the number of file snapshots in
  the CVS repo overruns an internal counter. Rebuild cvs-fast-export from source
  with a wider serial_t patched into cvs.h. Warning: this will significantly
  increase the working-set size</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
too many branches, widen branchcount_t
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Fatal error: the number of branches descended
  from some single commit overruns an nternal counter. Rebuild cvs-fast-export
  from source with a wider branchcount_t patched into cvs.h. Warning: this will
  significantly increase the working-set size</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
corrupt delta in
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The text of a delta is expected to be led with
  d (delete) and a (append) lines describing line-oriented changes at that
  delta. When you see this message, these are absent or garbled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
internal error - branch cycle
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">cvs-fast-export found a cycle while
  topologically sorting commits by parent link. This should never happen and
  probably indicates a serious internal error: please file a bug report.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
internal error - lost tag
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Late in analysis (after changeset coalescence)
  a tag lost its commit reference. This should never happen and probably
  indicates an internal error: please file a bug report.</div>
