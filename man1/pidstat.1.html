<p>PIDSTAT(1) Linux User&rsquo;s Manual PIDSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pidstat - Report statistics for Linux tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pidstat [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -I ] [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [
-U [ username ] ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -w ] [ -C comm ] [ -p {
pid [,...] | SELF | ALL } ] [ -T { TASK | CHILD | ALL } ] [
<br>
interval [ count ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pidstat command is used for monitoring individual tasks
currently being managed by the Linux kernel. It writes to
standard output activities for every task selected with <br>
option -p or for every task managed by the Linux kernel if
option -p ALL has been used. Not selecting any tasks is
equivalent to specifying -p ALL but only active tasks (tasks
<br>
with non-zero statistics values) will appear in the
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pidstat command can also be
used for monitoring the child processes of selected tasks.
Read about option -T below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interval parameter specifies
the amount of time in seconds between each report. A value
of 0 (or no parameters at all) indicates that tasks
statistics are to be reported for <br>
the time since system startup (boot). The count parameter
can be specified in conjunction with the interval parameter
if this one is not set to zero. The value of count
deter&acirc; <br>
mines the number of reports generated at interval seconds
apart. If the interval parameter is specified without the
count parameter, the pidstat command generates reports
contin&acirc; <br>
uously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can select information about
specific task activities using flags. Not specifying any
flags selects only CPU activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C comm <br>
Display only tasks whose command name includes the string
comm. This string can be a regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Report I/O statistics
(kernels 2.6.20 and later only). The following values may be
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UID <br>
The real user identification number of the task being
monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER <br>
The name of the real user owning the task being

be written to disk per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kB_ccwr/s <br>
Number of kilobytes whose writing to disk has been cancelled
by the task. This may occur when the task truncates some
dirty pagecache. In this case, some IO which <br>
another task has been accounted for will not be
happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command <br>
The command name of the task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display all activities
horizontally on a single line. This is intended to make it

indicate that tasks CPU usage (as displayed by option -u )
should be divided by the total number of processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Display the process command
name and all its arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p { pid [,...] | SELF | ALL }
<br>
Select tasks (processes) for which statistics are to be
reported. pid is the process identification number. The SELF
keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported <br>
for the pidstat process itself, whereas the ALL keyword
indicates that statistics are to be reported for all the
tasks managed by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Report page faults and memory

disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">majflt/s <br>
Total number of major faults the task has made per second,
those which have required loading a memory page from
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VSZ <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T { TASK | CHILD | ALL } <br>
This option specifies what has to be monitored by the

that statistics are to be reported for individual tasks and
globally for the selected tasks and their children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Global statistics for
tasks and all their children are not available for all
options of pidstat. Also these statistics are not
necessarily relevant to current time <br>
interval: The statistics of a child process are collected
only when it finishes or it is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Also display statistics for

(running a virtual processor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%CPU <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The pidstat command takes into account the following
environment variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S_TIME_FORMAT <br>
If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the
current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the
report header. The pidstat command will use the ISO <br>
8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
pidstat 2 5 <br>
Display five reports of CPU statistics for every active task
in the system at two second intervals.</p>

-r -p ALL <br>
Display global page faults and memory statistics for all the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pidstat -T CHILD -r 2 5 <br>
Display five reports of page faults statistics at two second
intervals for the child processes of all tasks in the
system. Only child processes with non-zero statistics <br>
values are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
/proc filesystem must be mounted for the pidstat command to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
