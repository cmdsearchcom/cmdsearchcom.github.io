perl5125delta - what is new for perl v5.12.5
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.4 release and the 5.12.5
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.3, first read
  perl5124delta, which describes differences between 5.12.3 and 5.12.4.

  decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939)</a></h2>
A bug in &quot;Encode&quot; could, on certain inputs, cause the heap to
  overflow. This problem has been corrected. Bug reported by Robert Zacek.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;_memory_error_with_GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC_(CVE-2011-2728)."><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;_memory_error_with_GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC_(CVE-2011-2728).">&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;
  memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).</a></h2>
Calling &quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob&quot; with the unsupported flag
  GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault. A Perl program
  that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose itself to
  denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks. There are no known
  exploits in the wild. The problem has been corrected by explicitly disabling
  all unsupported flags and setting unused function pointers to null. Bug
  reported by Clement Lecigne.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Heap_buffer_overrun_in_'x'_string_repeat_operator_(CVE-2012-5195)"><a class="selflink" href="#Heap_buffer_overrun_in_'x'_string_repeat_operator_(CVE-2012-5195)">Heap
  buffer overrun in 'x' string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195)</a></h2>
Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to perl's
  'x' string repeat operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
  denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before 5.15.5 can
  escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc
  before 2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.4. If any exist, they
  are bugs and reports are welcome.

<i>B::Concise</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
B::Concise no longer produces mangled output with the <b>-tree</b> option [perl
  #80632].
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>charnames</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A regression introduced in Perl 5.8.8 has been fixed, that caused
  charnames::viacode(0) to return &quot;undef&quot; instead of the string
  &quot;NULL&quot; [perl #72624].
<div class="Pp"></div>

  &quot;upper&quot;, not &quot;lower&quot;.

<i>Module::CoreList</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Module::CoreList has been updated to version 2.50_02 to add data for this

The perlebcdic document contains a helpful table to use in &quot;tr///&quot; to
  convert between EBCDIC and Latin1/ASCII. Unfortunately, the table was the
  inverse of the one it describes. This has been corrected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="perlunicode"><a class="selflink" href="#perlunicode">perlunicode</a></h2>
The section on User-Defined Case Mappings had some bad markup and unclear
  sentences, making parts of it unreadable. This has been rectified.

Perl 5.12.5 represents approximately 17 months of development since Perl 5.12.4
  and contains approximately 1,900 lines of changes across 64 files from 18
  authors.

<div class="Pp"></div>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
  to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
