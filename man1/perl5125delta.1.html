<p>PERL5125DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5125DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5125delta - what is new for perl v5.12.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.4
release and the 5.12.5 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.12.3, first read perl5124delta,
which describes differences between 5.12.3 and 5.12.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
&quot;Encode&quot; decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow
(CVE-2011-2939) <br>
A bug in &quot;Encode&quot; could, on certain inputs, cause
the heap to overflow. This problem has been corrected. Bug
reported by Robert Zacek.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;
memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728). <br>
Calling &quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob&quot; with the
unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access
violation / segfault. A Perl program that accepts a flags
value from an external <br>
source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary
code execution attacks. There are no known exploits in the
wild. The problem has been corrected by explicitly <br>
disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
pointers to null. Bug reported by Clement Lecigne.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Heap buffer overrun in
&rsquo;x&rsquo; string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195) <br>
Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify
the count to perl&rsquo;s &rsquo;x&rsquo; string repeat
operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
denial-of-service attack. A flaw <br>
in versions of perl before 5.15.5 can escalate that into a
heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc before
2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.4.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules <br>
B::Concise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B::Concise no longer produces
mangled output with the -tree option [perl #80632].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charnames</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A regression introduced in Perl
5.8.8 has been fixed, that caused charnames::viacode(0) to
return &quot;undef&quot; instead of the string
&quot;NULL&quot; [perl #72624].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encode has been upgraded from
version 2.39 to version 2.39_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Glob has been upgraded
from version 1.07 to version 1.07_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode::UCD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation for the
&quot;upper&quot; function now actually says
&quot;upper&quot;, not &quot;lower&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module::CoreList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module::CoreList has been
updated to version 2.50_02 to add data for this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>
perlebcdic <br>
The perlebcdic document contains a helpful table to use in
&quot;tr///&quot; to convert between EBCDIC and
Latin1/ASCII. Unfortunately, the table was the inverse of
the one it describes. <br>
This has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlunicode <br>
The section on User-Defined Case Mappings had some bad
markup and unclear sentences, making parts of it unreadable.
This has been rectified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perluniprops <br>
This document has been corrected to take non-ASCII platforms
into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
Platform Specific Changes <br>
Mac OS X <br>
There have been configuration and test fixes to make Perl
build cleanly on Lion and Mountain Lion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NetBSD <br>
The NetBSD hints file was corrected to be compatible with
NetBSD 6.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;chop&quot; now correctly handles
characters above &quot;fffff}&quot; [perl #73246].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;($&lt;,$&gt;) = (...)&quot; stopped working properly
in 5.12.0. It is supposed to make a single
&quot;setreuid()&quot; call, rather than calling
&quot;setruid()&quot; and &quot;seteuid()&quot; separately.
<br>
Consequently it did not work properly. This has been fixed
[perl #75212].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed a
regression of kill() when a match variable is used for the
process ID to kill [perl #75812].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot; no longer leaks memory. It
started leaking in Perl 5.10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The C-level
&quot;my_strftime&quot; functions no longer leaks memory.
This fixes a memory leak in &quot;POSIX::strftime&quot;
[perl #73520].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;caller&quot; no longer leaks memory when called from
the DB package if @DB::args was assigned to after the first
call to &quot;caller&quot;. Carp was triggering this bug
[perl #97010].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Passing to
&quot;index&quot; an offset beyond the end of the string
when the string is encoded internally in UTF8 no longer
causes panics [perl #75898].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Syntax errors in
&quot;(?{...})&quot; blocks in regular expressions no longer
cause panic messages [perl #2353].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.10.0
introduced some faulty logic that made &quot;U*&quot; in the
middle of a pack template equivalent to &quot;U0&quot; if
the input string was empty. This has been fixed [perl
#90160].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errata <br>
split() and @_ <br>
split() no longer modifies @_ when called in scalar or void
context. In void context it now produces a &quot;Useless use
of split&quot; warning. This is actually a change introduced
in <br>
perl 5.12.0, but it was missed from that release&rsquo;s
perl5120delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.12.5 represents approximately 17 months of
development since Perl 5.12.4 and contains approximately
1,900 lines of changes across 64 files from 18 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.12.5:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Andy Dougherty, Chris
&rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Craig A. Berry, David
Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, Florian
Ragwitz, George Greer, Goro Fuji, Jesse Vincent, Karl <br>
Williamson, Leon Brocard, Nicholas Clark, Rafael
Garcia-Suarez, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Steve Hay, Tony
Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
<br>
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
<br>
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
