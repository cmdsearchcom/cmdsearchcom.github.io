<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncatted - netCDF Attribute Editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
ncatted [-a att_dsc] [-a ...] [--bfr sz_byt][-D dbg_lvl]
[--glb att_name= att_val]] [-h] [--hdr_pad sz_byt] [-l path]
[-O] [-p path] [-R] [-r] [--ram_all] [-t] input-file [
out&acirc; <br>
put-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncatted edits attributes in a netCDF file. If you are
editing attributes then you are spending too much time in
the world of metadata, and ncatted was written to get you
back <br>
out as quickly and painlessly as possible. ncatted can
append, create, delete, modify, and overwrite attributes
(all explained below). Furthermore, ncatted allows each
editing <br>
operation to be applied to every variable in a file, thus
saving you time when you want to change attribute
conventions throughout a file. ncatted interprets character
<br>
attributes as strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because repeated use of ncatted
can considerably increase the size of the history global
attribute, the -h switch is provided to override
automatically appending the command to <br>
the history global attribute in the output-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ncatted is used to change
the _FillValue attribute, it changes the associated missing
data self-consistently. If the internal floating point
representation of a missing <br>
value, e.g., 1.0e36, differs between two machines then
netCDF files produced on those machines will have
incompatible missing values. This allows ncatted to change
the missing <br>
values in files from different machines to a single value so
that the files may then be concatenated together, e.g., by
ncrcat, without losing any information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key to mastering ncatted is
understanding the meaning of the structure describing the
attribute modification, att_dsc. Each att_dsc contains five
elements, which makes using <br>
ncatted somewhat complicated, but powerful. The att_dsc
argument structure contains five arguments in the following
order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">att_dsc = att_nm, var_nm, mode,
att_type, att_val</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">att_nm Attribute name. Example:
units</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">var_nm Variable name. Example:
pressure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode Edit mode abbreviation.
Example: a. See below for complete listing of valid values
of mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">att_type <br>
Attribute type abbreviation. Example: c. See below for
complete listing of valid values of att_type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">att_val <br>
Attribute value. Example: pascal. There should be no empty
space between these five consecutive arguments. The
description of these arguments follows in their order of
<br>
appearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of att_nm is the name
of the attribute you want to edit. This meaning of this
should be clear to all users of the ncatted operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of var_nm is the name
of the variable containing the attribute (named att_nm) that
you want to edit. There are two very important and useful
exceptions to this rule. <br>
The value of var_nm can also be used to direct ncatted to
edit global attributes, or to repeat the editing operation
for every variable in a file. A value of var_nm of
global&acirc; <br>
indicates that att_nm refers to a global attribute, rather
than a particular variable&rsquo;s attribute. This is the
method ncatted supports for editing global attributes. If
var_nm <br>
is left blank, on the other hand, then ncatted attempts to
perform the editing operation on every variable in the file.
This option may be convenient to use if you decide to <br>
change the conventions you use for describing the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of mode is a single
character abbreviation ( a, c, d, m, or o) standing for one
of five editing modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Append. Append value att_val
to current var_nm attribute att_nm value att_val, if any. If
var_nm does not have an attribute att_nm, it is created with
value att_val.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Create. Create variable var_nm
attribute att_nm with att_val if att_nm does not yet exist.
If var_nm already has an attribute att_nm, there is no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Delete. Delete current var_nm
attribute att_nm. If var_nm does not have an attribute
att_nm, there is no effect. When Delete mode is selected,
the att_type and att_val <br>
arguments are superfluous and may be left blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Modify. Change value of
current var_nm attribute att_nm to value att_val. If var_nm
does not have an attribute att_nm, there is no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Nappend. Append value att_val
to current var_nm attribute att_nm value att_val, if any. If
var_nm does not have an attribute att_nm, there is no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Overwrite. Write attribute
att_nm with value att_val to variable var_nm, overwriting
existing attribute att_nm, if any. This is the default
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of att_type is a
single character abbreviation ( f, d, l, s, c, or b)
standing for one of the six primitive netCDF data types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Float. Value(s) specified in
att_val will be stored as netCDF intrinsic type
NC_FLOAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Double. Value(s) specified in
att_val will be stored as netCDF intrinsic type
NC_DOUBLE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Long. Value(s) specified in
att_val will be stored as netCDF intrinsic type NC_LONG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Short. Value(s) specified in
att_val will be stored as netCDF intrinsic type
NC_SHORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Char. Value(s) specified in
att_val will be stored as netCDF intrinsic type NC_CHAR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Byte. Value(s) specified in
att_val will be stored as netCDF intrinsic type NC_BYTE. The
specification of att_type is optional in Delete mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of att_val is what you
want to change attribute att_nm to contain. The
specification of att_val is optional in Delete mode.
Attribute values for all types besides <br>
NC_CHAR must have an attribute length of at least one. Thus
att_val may be a single value or one-dimensional array of
elements of type att_type. If the att_val is not set or is
<br>
set to empty space, and the att_type is NC_CHAR, e.g., -a
units,T,o,c,&quot;&quot; or -a units,T,o,c,, then the
corresponding attribute is set to have zero length. When
specifying an <br>
array of values, it is safest to enclose att_val in double
or single quotes, e.g., -a levels,T,o,s,&quot;1,2,3,4&quot;
or -a levels,T,o,s,&rsquo;1,2,3,4&rsquo;. The quotes are
strictly unnecessary <br>
around att_val except when att_val contains characters which
would confuse the calling shell, such as spaces, commas, and
wildcard characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCO processing of NC_CHAR
attributes is a bit like Perl in that it attempts to do what
you want by default (but this sometimes causes unexpected
results if you want unusual data <br>
storage). If the att_type is NC_CHAR then the argument is
interpreted as a string and it may contain C-language escape
sequences, which NCO will interpret before writing
any&acirc; <br>
thing to disk. NCO translates valid escape sequences and
stores the appropriate ASCII code instead. Since two byte
escape sequences represent one byte ASCII codes, e.g., ASCII
<br>
10 (decimal), the stored string attribute is one byte
shorter than the input string length for each embedded
escape sequence. These sequences in particular allow
convenient <br>
editing of formatted text attributes. See ncks netCDF
Kitchen Sink, for more examples of string formatting (with
the ncks -s option) with special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Analogous to printf, other
special characters are also allowed by ncatted if they are
&quot;protected&quot; by a backslash. NCO simply strips away
the leading backslash from these charac&acirc; <br>
ters before editing the attribute. No other characters
require protection by a backslash. Backslashes which precede
any other character will not be filtered and will be <br>
included in the attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the NUL character
which terminates C language strings is assumed and need not
be explicitly specified. If NUL is input, it will not be
translated (because it would <br>
terminate the string in an additional location). Because of
these context-sensitive rules, if wish to use an attribute
of type NC_CHAR to store data, rather than text strings,
<br>
you should use ncatted with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Append the string &quot;Data version 2.0.0 to the global
attribute history: <br>
ncatted -O -a history,global,a,c,&quot;Data version 2.00
in.nc <br>
Note the use of embedded C language printf()-style escape
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the value of the
long_name attribute for variable T from whatever it
currently is to &quot;temperature&quot;: <br>
ncatted -O -a long_name,T,o,c,temperature in.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete all existing units
attributes: <br>
ncatted -O -a units,,d,, in.nc <br>
The value of var_nm was left blank in order to select all
variables in the file. The values of att_type and att_val
were left blank because they are superfluous in Delete
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modify all existing units
attributes to &quot;meter second-1&quot; <br>
ncatted -O -a units,,m,c,&quot;meter second-1&quot;
in.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overwrite the quanta attribute
of variable energy to an array of four integers. <br>
ncatted -O -a quanta,energy,o,s,&quot;010,101,111,121&quot;
in.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the manual for more complex
examples, including how to input C-language escape sequences
and other special characters like backslashes and question
marks.</p>
