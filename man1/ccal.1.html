<p>CAL(1) General Commands Manual CAL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccal - displays a calendar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccal [ options ] [ [ num_month ] year ] <br>
ccal [ options ] [ word_month ] [ year ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
By default, ccal will display a calendar for the current
month with the current day marked. By specifing certain
arguments, ccal will display a calendar for a whole year or
a <br>
specified month and year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transition from the Julian
to Gregorian calendar is assumed to have occured in 1752 on
the 3rd of September. Ten days following that date were
eliminated by the reformation, <br>
so the calendar for that month is a bit unusual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If displaying a calendar in the
single-month format, ccal will look for a date file. If
found, ccal will read the file, looking for special date
descriptions for that month which <br>
will be displayed to the right of the calendar. By default,
up to 24 appointments may be displayed per month. If the
current date happens to fall on one of these special dates,
<br>
it will be flagged by an asterisk. If there is room,
appointments for the next month may also be displayed with
some limitations (currently, special dates such as the 3rd
Thurs&acirc; <br>
day of will not be calculated for next month).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccal can also optionally use
colors when displaying the calendar. It will not display
colors any time the calendar is not directly displaying on
the console. This is generally <br>
the desired behavior when your redirecting cal&rsquo;s
output to another program or a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
A verbally-specified month may be entered without specifying
a year in the argument list; however, a single numerical
argument will be interpreted as a year. Only the first 3
<br>
characters of the month name are significant for a
verbally-specified month. The command &lsquo;cal 10&rsquo;
refers to 10 AD, not October, and not 1910.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--3[months] <br>
Display previous/current/next month together. This option
will be ignored when displaying a full year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--a[ppts] <br>
Maximum number of appointments to display. Minimum is 8,
maximum is 50, default is 24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--col[or-file]=filename <br>
Read color definitions from &lsquo;filename&rsquo; (default
color filename depends on operating system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--con[tinue]=n <br>
Display the next n successive months starting with the month
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--d[ata-file]=filename <br>
Read appointments from &lsquo;filename&rsquo; (default
appointment data filename depends on operating system). You
may use -d up to 8 times in a commandline to specify
multiple data <br>
file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--e[urope] <br>
Use European format (first weekday is Monday).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--a[merican] <br>
Use North American format (first weekday is Sunday), this is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--f[uture] <br>
If current month is displayed, then show only future
appointments from the date file, not appointments that are
past. This allows room for other descriptions with future
<br>
dates to be displayed. As time progresses through the month,
old descriptions are discarded and newer ones are used. The
--future switch affects only the display for the <br>
current month, and not other months.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--j[ulian] <br>
Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--m[onday] <br>
Display Monday as the first day of the week (same as
--europe)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noc[olor] <br>
Inhibit the use of colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nod[ata] <br>
Do not try to read any appointment data file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--p[ause] <br>
Pause before exiting and prompt for a keystroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--th[ismonth] <br>
Disable display of next month appointments; show only
current month&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to[day] <br>
Show only today&rsquo;s appointments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--u[se-color] <br>
Allow the use of colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--y[ear] <br>
Display a calendar for the current year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an optional environment
variable that can be used by ccal if found. If CALOPT is set
then ccal will read it and use any valid command line
options found. This allows <br>
any commonly used switches to be set in your environment and
always used (e.g. --europe). Ccal will produce its usage
screen when run if any invalid options are set in this <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND EXAMPLES <br>
ccal --f --d=my_dates <br>
display the current month and future appointments defined in
file &lsquo;my_dates&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccal 1996 <br>
display the entire year of 1996</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccal 9 1752 <br>
display the month of September 1752</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccal sep 1752 <br>
same as above</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccal January <br>
display January of the current year</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccal help <br>
help message displayed for unrecognized arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATE FILES <br>
ccal will search for a date file called cal.dat in the
directory it was executed from. If not found it will search
in the users $HOME directory for a file called .cal.dat. If
<br>
still not found, it will look for a global cal.dat in a
system wide directory. To find out where this location is
you can run ccal --help which will display the location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special date descriptions
specified in the date file are single lines, formatted as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY MM DD NW
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY is the year,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MM is the month (01 - 12),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DD is the day (00 if the NW
field is used),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NW is the weekday-of-month code
(00 if the DD field is used)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xxxx is the description; it will
be truncated as necessary to fit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data MUST occupy the
character fields as shown. If YYYY is specified as -999, the
month and day are assumed to be annual events such as
holidays, and the description will be <br>
displayed for any year. If MM is specified as -9, the day is
assumed to be a monthly event for the specified year. In the
weekday-of-month code NW, N signifies on which weekday <br>
W the special date occurs. For example, 31 indicates the
third sunday. Values of W range from 1 to 7, for Sunday to
Saturday, respectively. A value of 9 for N indicates
&quot;last&quot; <br>
as in 95 for &quot;last thursday.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ALL of the fields contain a
positive number and the year is at least 1970, then the
description is assumed to be periodic, starting at the given
date, with the period in days <br>
specified in NW (e.g. 1995 01 06 14 will display the
description every 2nd Friday using 6 January 1995 as the
base date). The base date does not get displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can display birthdays and
anniversaries by putting the year of birth (or other special
event) inside brackets or braces, in the description. This
number is converted to the <br>
number of years since the year you indicate and the brackets
or braces are removed from the output. If braces {} are used
the number will have an ordinal suffix, as in 21st, <br>
32nd, 43rd, 54th, etc. If the number in brackets or braces
is greater than the current year, the number will be
displayed unchanged. Example: &quot;Alex&rsquo;s {1961}
birthday&quot; will dis&acirc; <br>
play as &quot;Alex&rsquo;s 34th birthday&quot; (if the
current year is 1995). If you need to include brackets or
braces in your output then you can escape them by prefixing
it with a &rsquo;&acute;. <br>
Example: &quot;Alex&rsquo;s 1961 birthday&quot; will be
displayed as &quot;Alex&rsquo;s {1961} birthday&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If ccal is invoked with
the --europe or --monday switch, then the W values 1-7
denote Monday(1) to Sunday(7) rather than Sunday(1) to
Saturday(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line in cal.dat must start
with -999 or a 4-digit number to be considered as data. The
data lines may be in any order. All these appointments will
be displayed in chronologi&acirc; <br>
cal order, regardless of the ordering in the appointment
data file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ccal was compiled with the
reminder support then ccal will also search for the files
dates and .dates in the same places as for the caldat
equivalents. The dates file is used <br>
by the reminder(1) program and is an alternate,
less-powerful format for specifying descriptions. A file in
this format cannot be specified with the --data-file=
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reminder format consists of
text lines of length &lt; screen width in the following
format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDDDDDDD:N:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:yyyyyy:S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDDDDDDD <br>
is the date in one of the following formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M/D/Y an event occurring on a
specific day (year can be two or four digits, but must be
two for backward compatibility with reminder)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M/D an event occurring every
year</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D an event occurring every
month</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDD an event occurring every
week (day of the week is &rsquo;Sun&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Mon&rsquo;, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N is the number of days notice
of the event to give the user (ignored by ccal)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xxxxx the event description</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yyyyy an optional receptor of
the event (e.g. Mr. Jones)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S status flag, either N for
normal event or D for a deleted (not displayed) event</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines are ignored. A line
otherwise not in the above format is assume to specify a
file name from which to read more events. The file is
searched for in the usual places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALISATION <br>
ccal will also use the user&rsquo;s locale definitions to
determine which day to use as the starting weekday. This is
overriden if the -europe or the -american command line
switches <br>
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not set the -europe or
-american switch, your locale is properly defined, and you
see a different start weekday different from what you would
expect, either ccal or <br>
your libc definitions are to blame. If you think this is a
bug in ccal please report it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR ATTRIBUTES <br>
ccal will search for a color definition file called cal.col
in the directory it was executed from. If not found it will
search in the users $HOME directory for a file called <br>
.cal.col. If still not found, it will look for a global
system-wide /etc/cal.col You can confirm the location for
the system-wide definition by running ccal --help which will
<br>
display it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users may override the default
colors used when displaying calendars. This may be done by
creating a color definition file in their home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of a color definition
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 02 video colors for month
name <br>
01 03 video colors for weekday header <br>
07 01 video colors for normal calendar days <br>
13 01 video colors for sundays <br>
14 02 video colors for current day <br>
07 06 bkgd for yearly calendar (space between months) <br>
11 00 video colors for special day descriptions <br>
12 08 video colors for * indicating descr.=today</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FG BG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color definitions must appear as
above, as a two-character field for the foreground color,
followed by a space, followed by a two-character field for
the background color. The <br>
color definitions must start on the first line, and must not
contain blank lines. Comments may appear after the second
field, provided that the total line length does not exceed
<br>
80 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible colors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">black 0 <br>
blue 1 <br>
green 2 <br>
cyan 3 <br>
red 4 <br>
violet 5 <br>
orange 6 <br>
light gray 7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dark gray 8 <br>
bright blue 9 <br>
bright green 10 <br>
bright cyan 11 <br>
bright red 12 <br>
bright violet 13 <br>
yellow 14 <br>
white 15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying a background color
from 8 to 15 will result in a background color of 0 to 7,
with flashing text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
