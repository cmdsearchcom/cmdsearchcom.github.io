<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
EasyH10 - manage the iRiver H10 MP3 player</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
easyh10 [ options ] [ location ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
EasyH10 is a command-line utility to generate a media
database and playlist for an iRiver H10 digital audio
player. Transferring MP3/WMA/WAV files into the music
directories and <br>
creating M3U/M3U8/PLS playlist files under the music
directories or playlist directory must be done manually in
advance. EasyH10 then constructs a media database from the
music <br>
files and converts the playlist files into PLP/PLA playlist
files, which are recognized by the H10 player.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Database construction generates
a set of database files in the database directory, obtaining
the media information (e.g., title name, artist name, album
name, genre name, track <br>
number, etc.) from all MP3/WMA/WAV files found in the music
directories. Among database-related options, the update mode
(-U option) reads an existing media database, compares <br>
it with the current content of the music directories,
inserts entries for music files that have been added or
updated since the previous processing, and erases entries
for music <br>
files that have been removed. EasyH10 can force music tracks
to be played in an order that a user specified with -o
option. The way of obtaining the information of a music file
<br>
is also configurable (see -z option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Playlist conversion targets all
M3U/M3U8/PLS playlist files located in the playlist
directory (with -P option) and/or music directories (with -M
option). For each target, it <br>
finds the music files referred by the playlist and writes
out an iRiver-specific playlist file into the playlist
directory with the same file name. The converted playlist
files <br>
will have .plp extension for UMS players or .pla for MTP
players. The behavior when EasyH10 could not find a music
file referred by a playlist can be specified with options
-g, <br>
-f, and -k. Do not put two or more playlist files sharing
the same file name to avoid a collision of converted
playlist files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location specifies the path to
the root directory where an H10 player is mounted as an
external HDD. Three important directories, the database
directory, music directory, and <br>
playlist directory are determined automatically as relative
paths from the root directory. As for these directories,
refer to the description for options -d, -m, and -r that
<br>
configure the default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A model template must be
specified for EasyH10 to identify the model of the iriver
H10 player to be managed. EasyH10 assumes a default template
(easyh10.model) to be placed in <br>
the current directory, the root directory of the player,
easyh10/model directory from the player root directory, etc.
As for the complete list of directories for the default <br>
template, refer to the description of option -t, which
specifies a model template manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Database construction options: <br>
-C, --construct <br>
Discard an existing database and construct a new one from
music files located under the music directory. EasyH10
enumerates all MP3/WMA/WAV files in the music directo&acirc;
<br>
ries, obtains the media information (e.g., title name,
artist name, album name, genre name, track number, bitrate,
sample rate, etc.) from the found files, and generates a
<br>
set of database files in the database directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --update <br>
Update a media database from music files located under the
music directory. EasyH10 obtains the media information from
files that have been updated or added since the last <br>
database construction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --order=TYPE <br>
Choose a playback and displaying order in the MUSIC mode.
Selecting an order except for default inserts a space just
before track titles. This space is a special charac&acirc;
<br>
ter to control the playback order, but you may not notice it
because the player uses a proportional font by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d, default <br>
Leave the player to arrange music tracks in a default order
determined by the firmware. EasyH10 will not make any
attempt to change the playback order. The play&acirc; <br>
back order will be the same as that created by iriver plus
and Windows Media Player 10. If you have an H10 player
running on UMS 2.04 firmware, the playback order <br>
will be a numerical order of track numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t, tracktitle <br>
Force an alphabetical order of track titles. This order is
useful if you added the track number at the head of each
track name (e.g., &quot;01 song name&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f, filename <br>
Force an alphabetical order of file names. This order is
useful if you added the track number at the head of each
file name (e.g., &quot;01_songname.mp3&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n, tracknumber <br>
Force a numerical order of track numbers. The track number
must be associated with each music file. This order is the
most recommended option if you want to lis&acirc; <br>
ten to the music as if you listened to a CD. It arranges
music tracks in a numerical order of track numbers even when
entering all-tracks-by-an-artist navigation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c, complete <br>
Force a random order (shuffle) for any cases. The iRiver H10
player will turn into a shuffle-only player.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a, album <br>
Force a random order when playing music tracks in an album
and numerical order of track numbers when entering
all-tracks-by-an-artist or all-tracks-with-a-genre <br>
navigation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l, all Force a random order when
playing all titles and numerical order of track numbers when
playing music tracks in an album.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --source=METHOD <br>
Specify a method for obtaining media information. This
option was introduced for users who want to make use of
directory layout rather than tag information. EasyH10
pro&acirc; <br>
vides nine templates for specifying the source from which
the music information is obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Tag information in music files
(DEFAULT). This is the recommended option if the tag is
written into music files properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[g]p Parse path names to obtain
(genres and) artists. This template assumes directories in
the music directory to represent artist names. Other fields
(i.e., album <br>
name, genre name, track title, and track number) are
extracted from the tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[g]pa Parse path names to obtain
(genres,) artists, albums. This template assumes directories
in the music directory to represent artist names and
directory names from <br>
artist directories to represent album names. A path letter
&rsquo;/&rsquo; in the album directories are replaced with a
space. Other fields are extracted from the tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[g]pa[n]t <br>
Parse path names to obtain (genres,) artists, and albums;
parse file names to obtain (numbers and) titles. This
template assumes file names to represent track <br>
titles in addition to [g]pa template. Specifying n assumes
two letters at the head of file names to represent track
numbers. It skips space and &rsquo;_&rsquo; letters
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the two digits to extract track titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Playlist conversion options:
<br>
-P, --playlist <br>
Convert playlist files in the playlist directory. Setting
this option converts M3U/M3U8/PLS files located in the
playlist directory and writes respective PLA/PLP playlist
<br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --music <br>
Convert playlist files in the music directories. Setting
this option converts M3U/M3U8/PLS files located under the
music directories (including sub-directories) and <br>
writes respective PLA/PLP files to the playlist
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reconvert <br>
Overwrite the existing PLP/PLA playlist files to force
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --guess-missing <br>
Guess path names of missing music files in a playlist.
Setting this option tries to correct the location of music
files referred by a playlist by trying a possible
combi&acirc; <br>
nations of the path to the music folder and path to the
music file referred by the playlist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --find-missing <br>
Find path names of missing music files in a playlist.
Setting this option tries to correct the location of a music
file referred by a playlist by searching for the music <br>
file in the music directories that have the same file name.
Finding two or more music files that have the target file
name, EasyH10 selects a music file with a path name <br>
that is the most similar to the original one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --skip-missing <br>
Skip missing music files in a playlist. Setting this option
indicates EasyH10 to continue the playlist conversion only
with music files found in the H10 player. The <br>
default behavior for a missing music file is to cancel the
conversion for the playlist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --regex-playlist <br>
Enable Regular Expression Playlist (REP). Regular Expression
Playlist (REP) is a kind of smart playlist based on
path/file names. EasyH10 generates a playlist with music
<br>
files that are supported by the H10 player and match the
condition(s) described in *.rep file. If a music collection
has the folder structure with (genre,) artist, and <br>
album names, EasyH10 can automatically create a playlist
with all tracks in the player, by a specific artist, or by a
more complicated condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --auto-shuffle <br>
Shuffle music files in [(name).sfl*.(ext)] playlists. If a
playlist filename contains &quot;.sfl&quot; substring just
before an extension (e.g., hoge.sfl.m3u, fuga.sfl.pls, <br>
all.sfl.rep), EasyH10 automatically randomizes the order of
music tracks referred by the playlist. In other words,
EasyH10 users can create a random playlist only if they <br>
name it as &quot;(name).sfl.(extension)&quot; pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tuner preset options: <br>
-I, --import-tuner=FN <br>
Import a tuner preset from a file. EasyH10 will discard the
existing preset in the player without -a (--merge-tuner)
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --export-tuner=FN <br>
Export the current tuner preset to a file. EasyH10 will
discard the existing preset in the local file without -a
(--merge-tuner) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --merge-tuner <br>
Merge the current tuner preset with a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H10 Player model options: <br>
-t, --model=MODEL <br>
Specify a model template. EasyH10 uses this file to identify
an iRiver H10 model. By default, model template files are
copied into ${PREFIX}/share/easyh10/model by the <br>
installer. You may specify one of these template files. If
no model template is specified, EasyH10 finds a default
template (easyh10.model) in the following direc&acirc; <br>
tory/order: the current directory; ${H10ROOT}/easyh10/model;
${H10ROOT}/model; and ${H10ROOT}. Therefore, you may copy a
template file to these locations so that EasyH10 <br>
will read it automatically.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gen-model=MODEL,FW_MIN_VERSION,FW_MAX_VERSION
<br>
Create a model template from an existing database. This
option is only for EasyH10 developpers. Do not use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --install-model <br>
Install the model template specified by -t option into the
player. This will make a copy of the template file as
${H10ROOT}/easyh10.model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H10 location options: <br>
-s, --systempath=SYSTEM <br>
Specify the path to the system files. This option overwrites
the default value ${H10ROOT}/System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dbpath=DATABASE <br>
Specify the path to the database. This option overwrites the
default value ${H10ROOT}/System/DATA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --musicpath=MUSIC <br>
Specify the path to the music files. This option overwrites
the default value ${H10ROOT}/Media/Music for UMS players or
${H10ROOT}/Music for MTP players.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --playlistpath=PLAYLIST <br>
Specify the path to the playlist files. This option
overwrites the default value ${H10ROOT}/Media/Playlist for
UMS players or ${H10ROOT}/Playlists for MTP players.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Language-specific options: <br>
-e, --encoding=SE <br>
Specify a character encoding used by the operating system.
EasyH10 converts path/file names from the specified encoding
into UCS-2 using iconv. The default value is <br>
determined by an automatic detection of the system
character-encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --tagencoding=TE <br>
Specify a character encoding for parsing non-unicode tags.
EasyH10 converts non-unicode tags embedded in ID3v1, ID3v2,
and Riff WAVE into UCS- using iconv. The default <br>
value is ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bidi <br>
Store the field values in the database so that the player
can display Hebrew strings correctly (experimental).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous options: <br>
-D, --dump <br>
Output a database dump in plain text format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show this help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
It is recommended to copy a firmware model template to the
root of the device in order to avoid having to specify the
firmware every time the tool is used. The following example
<br>
is for the International version of the 5 GB player.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp
/usr/share/easyh10/model/H10Intl_5GB_FW2.04-2.05.model
/mnt/usbdisk/easyh10.model</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Depending on your installation
method, the .model files may be in /usr/share/easyh10/,
/usr/local/share/easyh10/ or
/usr/local/share/easyh10/model/)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
easyh10 -C -on /mnt/usbdisk <br>
Rebuild a media database with track-number ordering for the
H10 player mounted on /mnt/usbdisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">easyh10 -U -ol -PMrf
/mnt/usbdisk <br>
Update a media database with all-shuffle ordering. Reconvert
playlist files in /mnt/usbdisk/Media/Music and
/mnt/usbdisk/Media/Playlist/* into respective PLP playlist
<br>
files.</p>
