<p>CROSSREPORT(1) CrossReport CROSSREPORT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
CrossReport - Analysis tool to help cross-compilation to
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mingw32-crossreport [options] /path/to/linuxbinary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
CrossReport is a tool to help you analyze the APIs used by a
compiled Linux program, in order to work out the effort
required to cross-compile that program for Windows, using
the <br>
Fedora MinGW cross-compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest way to use it is to
point it at an existing Linux binary, and then read the
generated report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What it does in more detail: It
looks at the libraries and API calls used by the Linux
binary, and compares them to the libraries and API calls
that we currently support under <br>
the Fedora MinGW cross-compiler. It then works out what is
missing, and produces a report suggesting the amount of work
that needs to be done to port the program. For example, <br>
whether whole libraries need to be ported first, and/or how
to substitute individual calls to work on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Assuming that the excellent vector graphics editor Inkscape
(&lt;http://www.inkscape.org/&gt;) is installed, you could
do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mingw32-crossreport
/usr/bin/inkscape &gt; inkscape-report.txt <br>
less inkscape-report.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORTCOMINGS <br>
The report is only a general guide. CrossReport contains a
lot of knowledge about common Linux calls and APIs, but does
not know about every possible library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATABASE <br>
The program relies on a database of MinGW APIs. The default
location for this database is
&quot;/usr/share/crossreport/crossreport.db&quot; or the
same file in the current working <br>
directory. If the database cannot be found in either
location, the program will fail with an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The database is updated
regularly and distributed with CrossReport. To get the best
quality report, make sure you are running a recent version
of the program.</p>
