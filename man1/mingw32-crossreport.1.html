CrossReport - Analysis tool to help cross-compilation to Windows.

CrossReport is a tool to help you analyze the APIs used by a compiled Linux
  program, in order to work out the effort required to cross-compile that
  program for Windows, using the Fedora MinGW cross-compiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The simplest way to use it is to point it at an existing Linux binary, and then
  read the generated report.
<div class="Pp"></div>
What it does in more detail: It looks at the libraries and API calls used by the
  Linux binary, and compares them to the libraries and API calls that we
  currently support under the Fedora MinGW cross-compiler. It then works out
  what is missing, and produces a report suggesting the amount of work that
  needs to be done to port the program. For example, whether whole libraries
  need to be ported first, and/or how to substitute individual calls to work on
  Windows.

Assuming that the excellent vector graphics editor Inkscape
  (&lt;http://www.inkscape.org/&gt;) is installed, you could do:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 mingw32-crossreport /usr/bin/inkscape &gt; inkscape-report.txt
 less inkscape-report.txt
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SHORTCOMINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#SHORTCOMINGS">SHORTCOMINGS</a></h1>
The report is only a general guide. CrossReport contains a lot of knowledge
  about common Linux calls and APIs, but does not know about every possible
  library.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DATABASE"><a class="selflink" href="#DATABASE">DATABASE</a></h1>
The program relies on a database of MinGW APIs. The default location for this
  database is &quot;/usr/share/crossreport/crossreport.db&quot; or the same file
  in the current working directory. If the database cannot be found in either
  location, the program will fail with an error message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The database is updated regularly and distributed with CrossReport. To get the
  best quality report, make sure you are running a recent version of the
  program.
