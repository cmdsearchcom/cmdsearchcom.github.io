<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter. In its normal mode of
operation, it takes an email message or other text on
standard input, does a statistical check against lists of
&quot;good&quot; <br>
and &quot;bad&quot; words, and returns a status code
indicating whether or not the message is spam. Bogofilter is
designed with a fast algorithm, uses the Berkeley DB for
fast startup and <br>
lookups, coded directly in C, and tuned for speed, so it can
be used for production by sites that process a lot of
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEORY OF OPERATION <br>
Bogofilter treats its input as a bag of tokens. Each token
is checked against a wordlist, which maintains counts of the
numbers of times it has occurred in non-spam and spam <br>
mails. These numbers are used to compute an estimate of the
probability that a message in which the token occurs is
spam. Those are combined to indicate whether the message is
<br>
spam or ham.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While this method sounds crude
compared to the more usual pattern-matching approach, it
turns out to be extremely effective. Paul Graham&rsquo;s
paper A Plan For Spam[1] is recommended <br>
reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program substantially
improves on Paul&rsquo;s proposal by doing smarter lexical
analysis. Bogofilter does proper MIME decoding and a
reasonable HTML parsing. Special kinds of <br>
tokens like hostnames and IP addresses are retained as
recognition features rather than broken up. Various kinds of
MTA cruft such as dates and message-IDs are ignored so as
not <br>
to bloat the wordlist. Tokens found in various header fields
are marked appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another improvement is that this
program offers Gary Robinson&rsquo;s suggested modifications
to the calculations (see the parameters robx and robs
below). These modifications are <br>
described in Robinson&rsquo;s paper Spam Detection[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since then, Robinson (see his
Linux Journal article A Statistical Approach to the Spam
Problem[3]) and others have realized that the calculation
can be further optimized using <br>
Fisher&rsquo;s method. Another improvement[4] compensates
for token redundancy by applying separate effective size
factors (ESF) to spam and nonspam probability
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In short, this is how it works:
The estimates for the spam probabilities of the individual
tokens are combined using the &quot;inverse chi-square
function&quot;. Its value indicates how <br>
badly the null hypothesis that the message is just a random
collection of independent words with probabilities given by
our previous estimates fails. This function is very <br>
sensitive to small probabilities (hammish words), but not to
high probabilities (spammish words); so the value only
indicates strong hammish signs in a message. Now using
inverse <br>
probabilities for the tokens, the same computation is done
again, giving an indicator that a message looks strongly
spammish. Finally, those two indicators are subtracted (and
<br>
scaled into a 0-1-interval). This combined indicator
(bogosity) is close to 0 if the signs for a hammish message
are stronger than for a spammish message and close to 1 if
the <br>
situation is the other way round. If signs for both are
equally strong, the value will be near 0.5. Since those
message don&rsquo;t give a clear indication there is a
tristate mode in <br>
bogofilter to mark those messages as unsure, while the clear
messages are marked as spam or ham, respectively. In
two-state mode, every message is marked as either spam or
ham.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various parameters influence
these calculations, the most important are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">robx: the score given to a token
which has not seen before. robx is the probability that the
token is spammish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">robs: a weight on robx which
moves the probability of a little seen token towards
robx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-dev: a minimum distance from
.5 for tokens to use in the calculation. Only tokens farther
away from 0.5 than this value are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spam-cutoff: messages with
scores greater than or equal to will be marked as spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ham-cutoff: If zero or
spam-cutoff, all messages with values strictly below
spam-cutoff are marked as ham, all others as spam
(two-state). Else values less than or equal to <br>
ham-cutoff are marked as ham, messages with values strictly
between ham-cutoff and spam-cutoff are marked as unsure; the
rest as spam (tristate)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sp-esf: the effective size
factor (ESF) for spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ns-esf: the ESF for nonspam.
These ESF values default to 1.0, which is the same as not
using ESF in the calculation. Values suitable to a
user&rsquo;s email population can be <br>
determined with the aid of the bogotune program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
HELP OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h option prints the help
message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V option prints the version
number and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Q (query) option prints
bogofilter&rsquo;s configuration, i.e. registration
parameters, parsing options, bogofilter directory, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSIFICATION OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p (passthrough) option
outputs the message with an X-Bogosity line at the end of
the message header. This requires keeping the entire message
in memory when it&rsquo;s read from <br>
stdin (or from a pipe or socket). If the message is read
from a file that can be rewound, bogofilter will read it a
second time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e (embed) option tells
bogofilter to exit with code 0 if the message can be
classified, i.e. if there is not an error. Normally
bogofilter uses different codes for spam, <br>
ham, and unsure classifications, but this simplifies using
bogofilter with procmail or maildrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t (terse) option tells
bogofilter to print an abbreviated spamicity message
containing 1 letter and the score. Spam is indicated with
&quot;Y&quot;, ham by &quot;N&quot;, and unsure by
&quot;U&quot;. <br>
Note: the formatting can be customized using the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T provides an invariant
terse mode for scripts to use. bogofilter will print an
abbreviated spamicity message containing 1 letter and the
score. Spam is indicated with &quot;S&quot;, <br>
ham by &quot;H&quot;, and unsure by &quot;U&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -TT provides an invariant
terse mode for scripts to use. Bogofilter prints only the
score and displays it to 16 significant digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -u option tells bogofilter
to register the message&rsquo;s text after classifying it as
spam or non-spam. A spam message will be registered on the
spamlist and a non-spam message <br>
on the goodlist. If the classification is
&quot;unsure&quot;, the message will not be registered.
Effectively this option runs bogofilter with the -s or -n
flag, as appropriate. Caution is <br>
urged in the use of this capability, as any classification
errors bogofilter may make will be preserved and will
accumulate until manually corrected with the -Sn and -Ns
option <br>
combinations. Note this option causes the database to be
opened for write access, which can entail massive slowdowns
through lock contention and synchronous I/O operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -H option tells bogofilter
to not tag tokens from the header. This option is for
testing, you should not use it in normal operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -M option tells bogofilter
to process its input as a mbox formatted file. If the -v or
-t option is also given, a spamicity line will be printed
for each message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b (streaming bulk mode)
option tells bogofilter to classify multiple objects whose
names are read from stdin. If the -v or -t option is also
given, bogofilter will print a <br>
line giving file name and classification information for
each file. This is an alternative to -B which lists objects
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An object in this context shall
be a maildir (autodetected), or if it&rsquo;s not a maildir,
a single mail unless -M is given - in that case it&rsquo;s
processed as mbox. (The <br>
Content-Length: header is not taken into account
currently.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading mbox format,
bogofilter relies on the empty line after a mail. If needed,
formail -es will ensure this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -B object ... (bulk mode)
option tells bogofilter to classify multiple objects named
on the command line. The objects may be filenames (for
single messages), mailboxes <br>
(files with multiple messages), or directories (of maildir
and MH format). If the -v or -t option is also given,
bogofilter will print a line giving file name and
classification <br>
information for each file. This is an alternative to -b
which lists objects on stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -R option tells bogofilter
to output an R data frame in text form on the standard
output. See the section on integration with R, below, for
further detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGISTRATION OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option tells bogofilter
to register the text presented as spam. The database is
created if absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option tells bogofilter
to register the text presented as non-spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bogofilter doesn&rsquo;t detect
if a message registered twice. If you do this by accident,
the token counts will off by 1 from what you really want and
the corresponding spam scores <br>
will be slightly off. Given a large number of tokens and
messages in the wordlist, this doesn&rsquo;t matter. The
problem can be corrected by using the -S option or the -N
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S option tells bogofilter
to undo a prior registration of the same message as spam. If
a message was incorrectly entered as spam by -s or -u and
you want to remove it and <br>
enter it as non-spam, use -Sn. If -S is used for a message
that wasn&rsquo;t registered as spam, the counts will still
be decremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N option tells bogofilter
to undo a prior registration of the same message as
non-spam. If a message was incorrectly entered as non-spam
by -n or -u and you want to remove <br>
it and enter it as spam, then use -Ns. If -N is used for a
message that wasn&rsquo;t registered as non-spam, the counts
will still be decremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c filename option tells
bogofilter to read the config file named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option prevents
bogofilter from reading configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d dir option allows you to
set the directory for the database. See the ENVIRONMENT
section for other directory setting options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -k cachesize option sets the
cache size for the BerkeleyDB subsystem, in units of 1 MiB
(1,048,576 bytes). Properly sizing the cache improves
bogofilter&rsquo;s performance. The <br>
recommended size is one third of the size of the database
file. You can run the bogotune script (in the tuning
directory) to determine the recommended size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option writes an
informational line to the system log each time bogofilter is
run. The information logged depends on how bogofilter is
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L tag option configures a
tag which can be included in the information being logged by
the -l option, but it requires a custom format that includes
the %l string for now. <br>
This option implies -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -I filename option tells
bogofilter to read its input from the specified file, rather
than from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -O filename option tells
bogofilter where to write its output in passthrough mode.
Note that this only works when -p is explicitly given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETER OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -E value[,value] option
allows setting the sp-esf value and the ns-esf value. With
two values, both sp-esf and ns-esf are set. If only one
value is given, parameters are set <br>
as described in the note below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m value[,value][,value]
option allows setting the min-dev value and, optionally, the
robs and robx values. With three values, min-dev, robs, and
robx are all set. If fewer <br>
values are given, parameters are set as described in the
note below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o value[,value] option
allows setting the spam-cutoff ham-cutoff values. With two
values, both spam-cutoff and ham-cutoff are set. If only one
value is given, parameters are <br>
set as described in the note below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: All of these options allow
fewer values to be provided. Values can be skipped by using
just the comma delimiter, in which case the corresponding
parameter(s) won&rsquo;t be <br>
changed. If only the first value is provided, then only the
first parameter is set. Trailing values can be skipped, in
which case the corresponding parameters won&rsquo;t be
changed. <br>
Within the parameter list, spaces are not allowed after
commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INFO OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option produces a report
to standard output on bogofilter&rsquo;s analysis of the
input. Each additional v will increase the verbosity of the
output, up to a maximum of 4. With <br>
-vv, the report lists the tokens with highest deviation from
a mean of 0.5 association with spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -y date can be used to
override the current date when timestamping tokens. A value
of zero (0) turns off timestamping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D option redirects debug
output to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -x flags option allows
setting of debug flags for printing debug information. See
header file debug.h for the list of usable flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using GNU longopt -- syntax, a
config file&rsquo;s name=value statement becomes a command
line&rsquo;s --option=value. Use command bogofilter --help
for a list of options and see <br>
bogofilter.cf.example for more info on them. For example to
change the X-Bogosity header to &quot;X-Spam-Header&quot;,
use:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spam-header-name=X-Spam-Header</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Bogofilter uses a database directory, which can be set in
the config file. If not set there, bogofilter will use the
value of BOGOFILTER_DIR. Both can be overridden by the -d
dir <br>
option. If none of that is available, bogofilter will use
directory $HOME/.bogofilter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The bogofilter command line allows setting of many options
that determine how bogofilter operates. File
/etc/bogofilter.cf can be used to set additional parameters
that affect <br>
its operation. File /etc/bogofilter.cf.example has samples
of all of the parameters. Status and logging messages can be
customized for each site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
0 for spam; 1 for non-spam; 2 for unsure ; 3 for I/O or
other errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both -p and -e are used, the
return values are: 0 for spam or non-spam; 3 for I/O or
other errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error 3 usually means that the
wordlist file bogofilter wants to read at startup is missing
or the hard disk has filled up in -p mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TOOLS
<br>
Use with procmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following recipe (a)
spam-bins anything that bogofilter rates as spam, (b)
registers the words in messages rated as spam as such, and
(c) registers the words in messages <br>
rated as non-spam as such. With this in place, it will
normally only be necessary for the user to intervene (with
-Ns or -Sn) when bogofilter miscategorizes something.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># filter mail through
bogofilter, tagging it as Ham, Spam, or Unsure, <br>
# and updating the wordlist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0fw <br>
| bogofilter -u -e -p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># if bogofilter failed, return
the mail to the queue; <br>
# the MTA will retry to deliver it later <br>
# 75 is the value for EX_TEMPFAIL in
/usr/include/sysexits.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0e <br>
{ EXITCODE=75 HOST }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># file the mail to
spam-bogofilter if it&rsquo;s spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0: <br>
* ^X-Bogosity: Spam, tests=bogofilter <br>
spam-bogofilter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># file the mail to
unsure-bogofilter <br>
# if it&rsquo;s neither ham nor spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0: <br>
* ^X-Bogosity: Unsure, tests=bogofilter <br>
unsure-bogofilter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># With this recipe, you can
train bogofilter starting with an empty <br>
# wordlist. Be sure to check your unsure-folder regularly,
take the <br>
# messages out of it, classify them as ham (or spam), and
use them to <br>
# train bogofilter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following procmail rule will
take mail on stdin and save it to file spam if bogofilter
thinks it&rsquo;s spam:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0HB: <br>
* ? bogofilter <br>
spam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and this similar rule will also
register the tokens in the mail according to the bogofilter
classification:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0HB: <br>
* ? bogofilter -u <br>
spam</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If bogofilter fails (returning
3) the message will be treated as non-spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This one is for maildrop, it
automatically defers the mail and retries later when the
xfilter command fails, use this in your ~/.mailfilter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfilter &quot;bogofilter -u -e
-p&quot; <br>
if (/^X-Bogosity: Spam, tests=bogofilter/) <br>
{ <br>
to &quot;spam-bogofilter&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following .muttrc lines will
create mutt macros for dispatching mail to bogofilter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macro index d
&quot;&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key
&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -n &lt;enter-command&gt;set
wait_key &lt;delete-message&gt;&quot; &quot;delete message
as non-spam&quot; <br>
macro index \d &quot;&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key
&lt;pipe-entry&gt;bogofilter -s &lt;enter-command&gt;set
wait_key &lt;delete-message&gt;&quot; &quot;delete message
as spam&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integration with Mail Transport
Agent (MTA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. bogofilter can also be
integrated into an MTA to filter all incoming mail. While
the specific implementation is MTA dependent, the general
steps are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Install bogofilter on the
mail server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Prime the bogofilter
databases with a spam and non-spam corpus. Since bogofilter
will be serving a larger community, it is important to prime
it with a representative set of <br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Set up the MTA to invoke
bogofilter on each message. While this is an MTA specific
step, you&rsquo;ll probably need to use the -p, -u, and -e
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Set up a mechanism for users
to register spam/non-spam messages, as well as to correct
mis-classifications. The most generic solution is to set up
alias email addresses to <br>
which users bounce messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. See the doc and contrib
directories for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of R to verify
bogofilter&rsquo;s calculations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -R option tells bogofilter
to generate an R data frame. The data frame contains one row
per token analyzed. Each such row contains the token, the
sum of its database &quot;good&quot; <br>
and &quot;spam&quot; counts, the &quot;good&quot; count
divided by the number of non-spam messages used to create
the training database, the &quot;spam&quot; count divided by
the spam message count, <br>
Robinson&rsquo;s f(w) for the token, the natural logs of (1
- f(w)) and f(w), and an indicator character (+ if the
token&rsquo;s f(w) value exceeded the minimum deviation from
0.5, - if it <br>
didn&rsquo;t). There is one additional row at the end of the
table that contains a label in the token field, followed by
the number of words actually used (the ones with +
indicators), <br>
Robinson&rsquo;s P, Q, S, s and x values and the minimum
deviation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The R data frame can be saved to
a file and later read into an R session (see the R project
website[5] for information about the mathematics package R).
Provided with the <br>
bogofilter distribution is a simple R script (file bogo.R)
that can be used to verify bogofilter&rsquo;s calculations.
Instructions for its use are included in the script in the
form <br>
of comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG MESSAGES <br>
Bogofilter writes messages to the system log when the -l
option is used. What is written depends on which other flags
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A classification run will
generate (we are not showing the date and host part
here):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogofilter[1412]: X-Bogosity:
Ham, spamicity=0.000227 <br>
bogofilter[1415]: X-Bogosity: Spam, spamicity=0.998918</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using -u to classify a message
and update a wordlist will produce (one a single line):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogofilter[1426]: X-Bogosity:
Spam, spamicity=0.998918, <br>
register -s, 329 words, 1 messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Registering words (-l and -s,
-n, -S, or -N) will produce:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogofilter[1440]: register-n,
255 words, 1 messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A registration run (using -s,
-n, -N, or -S) will generate messages like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bogofilter[17330]: register-n,
574 words, 3 messages <br>
bogofilter[6244]: register-s, 1273 words, 4 messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
