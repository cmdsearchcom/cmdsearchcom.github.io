<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter. In its normal mode of operation, it takes
  an email message or other text on standard input, does a statistical check
  against lists of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; words, and returns a
  status code indicating whether or not the message is spam. Bogofilter is
  designed with a fast algorithm, uses the Berkeley DB for fast startup and
  lookups, coded directly in C, and tuned for speed, so it can be used for
  production by sites that process a lot of mail.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THEORY_OF_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#THEORY_OF_OPERATION">THEORY
  OF OPERATION</a></h1>
Bogofilter treats its input as a bag of tokens. Each token is checked against a
  wordlist, which maintains counts of the numbers of times it has occurred in
  non-spam and spam mails. These numbers are used to compute an estimate of the
  probability that a message in which the token occurs is spam. Those are
  combined to indicate whether the message is spam or ham.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While this method sounds crude compared to the more usual pattern-matching
  approach, it turns out to be extremely effective. Paul Graham's paper <b>A
  Plan For Spam</b>[1] is recommended reading.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program substantially improves on Paul's proposal by doing smarter lexical
  analysis. Bogofilter does proper MIME decoding and a reasonable HTML parsing.
  Special kinds of tokens like hostnames and IP addresses are retained as
  recognition features rather than broken up. Various kinds of MTA cruft such as
  dates and message-IDs are ignored so as not to bloat the wordlist. Tokens
  found in various header fields are marked appropriately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another improvement is that this program offers Gary Robinson's suggested
  modifications to the calculations (see the parameters robx and robs below).
  These modifications are described in Robinson's paper <b>Spam
  Detection</b>[2].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since then, Robinson (see his Linux Journal article <b>A Statistical Approach to
  the Spam Problem</b>[3]) and others have realized that the calculation can be
  further optimized using Fisher's method. <b>Another improvement</b>[4]
  compensates for token redundancy by applying separate effective size factors
  (ESF) to spam and nonspam probability calculations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In short, this is how it works: The estimates for the spam probabilities of the
  individual tokens are combined using the &quot;inverse chi-square
  function&quot;. Its value indicates how badly the null hypothesis that the
  message is just a random collection of independent words with probabilities
  given by our previous estimates fails. This function is very sensitive to
  small probabilities (hammish words), but not to high probabilities (spammish
  words); so the value only indicates strong hammish signs in a message. Now
  using inverse probabilities for the tokens, the same computation is done
  again, giving an indicator that a message looks strongly spammish. Finally,
  those two indicators are subtracted (and scaled into a 0-1-interval). This
  combined indicator (bogosity) is close to 0 if the signs for a hammish message
  are stronger than for a spammish message and close to 1 if the situation is
  the other way round. If signs for both are equally strong, the value will be
  near 0.5. Since those message don't give a clear indication there is a
  tristate mode in bogofilter to mark those messages as unsure, while the clear
  messages are marked as spam or ham, respectively. In two-state mode, every
  message is marked as either spam or ham.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various parameters influence these calculations, the most important are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
robx: the score given to a token which has not seen before. robx is the
  probability that the token is spammish.
<div class="Pp"></div>
robs: a weight on robx which moves the probability of a little seen token
  towards robx.
<div class="Pp"></div>
min-dev: a minimum distance from .5 for tokens to use in the calculation. Only
  tokens farther away from 0.5 than this value are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
spam-cutoff: messages with scores greater than or equal to will be marked as
  spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ham-cutoff: If zero or spam-cutoff, all messages with values strictly below
  spam-cutoff are marked as ham, all others as spam (two-state). Else values
  less than or equal to ham-cutoff are marked as ham, messages with values
  strictly between ham-cutoff and spam-cutoff are marked as unsure; the rest as
  spam (tristate)
<div class="Pp"></div>
sp-esf: the effective size factor (ESF) for spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ns-esf: the ESF for nonspam. These ESF values default to 1.0, which is the same
  as not using ESF in the calculation. Values suitable to a user's email
  population can be determined with the aid of the bogotune program.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
HELP OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-h</b> option prints the help message and exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-V</b> option prints the version number and exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-Q</b> (query) option prints bogofilter's configuration, i.e.
  registration parameters, parsing options, bogofilter directory, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CLASSIFICATION OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-p</b> (passthrough) option outputs the message with an X-Bogosity line
  at the end of the message header. This requires keeping the entire message in
  memory when it's read from stdin (or from a pipe or socket). If the message is
  read from a file that can be rewound, bogofilter will read it a second time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-e</b> (embed) option tells bogofilter to exit with code 0 if the message
  can be classified, i.e. if there is not an error. Normally bogofilter uses
  different codes for spam, ham, and unsure classifications, but this simplifies
  using bogofilter with procmail or maildrop.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-t</b> (terse) option tells bogofilter to print an abbreviated spamicity
  message containing 1 letter and the score. Spam is indicated with
  &quot;Y&quot;, ham by &quot;N&quot;, and unsure by &quot;U&quot;. Note: the
  formatting can be customized using the config file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-T</b> provides an invariant terse mode for scripts to use. bogofilter
  will print an abbreviated spamicity message containing 1 letter and the score.
  Spam is indicated with &quot;S&quot;, ham by &quot;H&quot;, and unsure by
  &quot;U&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-TT</b> provides an invariant terse mode for scripts to use. Bogofilter
  prints only the score and displays it to 16 significant digits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-u</b> option tells bogofilter to register the message's text after
  classifying it as spam or non-spam. A spam message will be registered on the
  spamlist and a non-spam message on the goodlist. If the classification is
  &quot;unsure&quot;, the message will not be registered. Effectively this
  option runs bogofilter with the <b>-s</b> or <b>-n</b> flag, as appropriate.
  Caution is urged in the use of this capability, as any classification errors
  bogofilter may make will be preserved and will accumulate until manually
  corrected with the <b>-Sn</b> and <b>-Ns</b> option combinations. Note this
  option causes the database to be opened for write access, which can entail
  massive slowdowns through lock contention and synchronous I/O operations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-H</b> option tells bogofilter to not tag tokens from the header. This
  option is for testing, you should not use it in normal operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-M</b> option tells bogofilter to process its input as a mbox formatted
  file. If the <b>-v</b> or <b>-t</b> option is also given, a spamicity line
  will be printed for each message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-b</b> (streaming bulk mode) option tells bogofilter to classify multiple
  objects whose names are read from stdin. If the <b>-v</b> or <b>-t</b> option
  is also given, bogofilter will print a line giving file name and
  classification information for each file. This is an alternative to <b>-B</b>
  which lists objects on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An object in this context shall be a maildir (autodetected), or if it's not a
  maildir, a single mail unless <b>-M</b> is given - in that case it's processed
  as mbox. (The Content-Length: header is not taken into account currently.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When reading mbox format, bogofilter relies on the empty line after a mail. If
  needed, <b>formail -es</b> will ensure this is the case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-B </b><b></b><i>object ...</i> (bulk mode) option tells bogofilter to
  classify multiple objects named on the command line. The objects may be
  filenames (for single messages), mailboxes (files with multiple messages), or
  directories (of maildir and MH format). If the <b>-v</b> or <b>-t</b> option
  is also given, bogofilter will print a line giving file name and
  classification information for each file. This is an alternative to <b>-b</b>
  which lists objects on stdin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-R</b> option tells bogofilter to output an R data frame in text form on
  the standard output. See the section on integration with R, below, for further
  detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
REGISTRATION OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-s</b> option tells bogofilter to register the text presented as spam.
  The database is created if absent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-n</b> option tells bogofilter to register the text presented as
  non-spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bogofilter doesn't detect if a message registered twice. If you do this by
  accident, the token counts will off by 1 from what you really want and the
  corresponding spam scores will be slightly off. Given a large number of tokens
  and messages in the wordlist, this doesn't matter. The problem <i>can</i> be
  corrected by using the <b>-S</b> option or the <b>-N</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-S</b> option tells bogofilter to undo a prior registration of the same
  message as spam. If a message was incorrectly entered as spam by <b>-s</b> or
  <b>-u</b> and you want to remove it and enter it as non-spam, use <b>-Sn</b>.
  If <b>-S</b> is used for a message that wasn't registered as spam, the counts
  will still be decremented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-N</b> option tells bogofilter to undo a prior registration of the same
  message as non-spam. If a message was incorrectly entered as non-spam by
  <b>-n</b> or <b>-u</b> and you want to remove it and enter it as spam, then
  use <b>-Ns</b>. If <b>-N</b> is used for a message that wasn't registered as
  non-spam, the counts will still be decremented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GENERAL OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-c </b><b></b><i>filename</i> option tells bogofilter to read the config
  file named.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-C</b> option prevents bogofilter from reading configuration files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-d </b><b></b><i>dir</i> option allows you to set the directory for the
  database. See the ENVIRONMENT section for other directory setting options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-k </b><b></b><i>cachesize</i> option sets the cache size for the
  BerkeleyDB subsystem, in units of 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes). Properly sizing the
  cache improves bogofilter's performance. The recommended size is one third of
  the size of the database file. You can run the bogotune script (in the tuning
  directory) to determine the recommended size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-l</b> option writes an informational line to the system log each time
  bogofilter is run. The information logged depends on how bogofilter is run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-L </b><b></b><i>tag</i> option configures a tag which can be included in
  the information being logged by the <b>-l</b> option, but it requires a custom
  format that includes the %l string for now. This option implies <b>-l</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-I </b><b></b><i>filename</i> option tells bogofilter to read its input
  from the specified file, rather than from <b>stdin</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-O </b><b></b><i>filename</i> option tells bogofilter where to write its
  output in passthrough mode. Note that this only works when -p is explicitly
  given.
<div class="Pp"></div>
PARAMETER OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-E </b><b></b><i>value</i><i>[,value]</i> option allows setting the
  sp-esf value and the ns-esf value. With two values, both sp-esf and ns-esf are
  set. If only one value is given, parameters are set as described in the note
  below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-m </b><b></b><i>value</i><i>[,value]</i><i>[,value]</i> option allows
  setting the min-dev value and, optionally, the robs and robx values. With
  three values, min-dev, robs, and robx are all set. If fewer values are given,
  parameters are set as described in the note below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-o </b><b></b><i>value</i><i>[,value]</i> option allows setting the
  spam-cutoff ham-cutoff values. With two values, both spam-cutoff and
  ham-cutoff are set. If only one value is given, parameters are set as
  described in the note below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: All of these options allow fewer values to be provided. Values can be
  skipped by using just the comma delimiter, in which case the corresponding
  parameter(s) won't be changed. If only the first value is provided, then only
  the first parameter is set. Trailing values can be skipped, in which case the
  corresponding parameters won't be changed. Within the parameter list, spaces
  are not allowed after commas.
<div class="Pp"></div>
INFO OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> option produces a report to standard output on bogofilter's
  analysis of the input. Each additional <b>v</b> will increase the verbosity of
  the output, up to a maximum of 4. With <b>-vv</b>, the report lists the tokens
  with highest deviation from a mean of 0.5 association with spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Option <b>-y date</b> can be used to override the current date when timestamping
  tokens. A value of zero (0) turns off timestamping.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-D</b> option redirects debug output to stdout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-x </b><b></b><i>flags</i> option allows setting of debug flags for
  printing debug information. See header file debug.h for the list of usable
  flags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CONFIG FILE OPTIONS
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using GNU longopt <b>--</b> syntax, a config file's <b></b><i>name=value</i>
  statement becomes a command line's <b>--</b><b></b><i>option=value</i>. Use
  command <b>bogofilter --help</b> for a list of options and see
  bogofilter.cf.example for more info on them. For example to change the
  X-Bogosity header to &quot;X-Spam-Header&quot;, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b></b><i>--spam-header-name=X-Spam-Header</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Bogofilter uses a database directory, which can be set in the config file. If
  not set there, bogofilter will use the value of <b>BOGOFILTER_DIR</b>. Both
  can be overridden by the <b>-d </b><b></b><i>dir</i> option. If none of that
  is available, bogofilter will use directory $HOME/.bogofilter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The bogofilter command line allows setting of many options that determine how
  bogofilter operates. File /etc/bogofilter.cf can be used to set additional
  parameters that affect its operation. File /etc/bogofilter.cf.example has
  samples of all of the parameters. Status and logging messages can be
  customized for each site.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_VALUES">RETURN
  VALUES</a></h1>
0 for spam; 1 for non-spam; 2 for unsure ; 3 for I/O or other errors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If both <b>-p</b> and <b>-e</b> are used, the return values are: 0 for spam or
  non-spam; 3 for I/O or other errors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Error 3 usually means that the wordlist file bogofilter wants to read at startup
  is missing or the hard disk has filled up in <b>-p</b> mode.

The following recipe (a) spam-bins anything that bogofilter rates as spam, (b)
  registers the words in messages rated as spam as such, and (c) registers the
  words in messages rated as non-spam as such. With this in place, it will
  normally only be necessary for the user to intervene (with <b>-Ns</b> or
  <b>-Sn</b>) when bogofilter miscategorizes something.

The following procmail rule will take mail on stdin and save it to file spam if
  bogofilter thinks it's spam:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
:0HB:
* ? bogofilter
spam
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and this similar rule will also register the tokens in the mail according to the
  bogofilter classification:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
:0HB:

<div class="Pp"></div>
If bogofilter fails (returning 3) the message will be treated as non-spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This one is for maildrop, it automatically defers the mail and retries later

Integration with Mail Transport Agent (MTA)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.bogofilter can also be integrated into an
  MTA to filter all incoming mail. While the specific implementation is MTA
  dependent, the general steps are as follows:</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.Install bogofilter on the mail server</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 3.Prime the bogofilter databases with a spam
  and non-spam corpus. Since bogofilter will be serving a larger community, it
  is important to prime it with a representative set of messages.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 4.Set up the MTA to invoke bogofilter on each
  message. While this is an MTA specific step, you'll probably need to use the
  <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b>, and <b>-e</b> options.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 5.Set up a mechanism for users to register
  spam/non-spam messages, as well as to correct mis-classifications. The most
  generic solution is to set up alias email addresses to which users bounce
  messages.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 6.See the doc and contrib directories for
  more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use of R to verify bogofilter's calculations
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -R option tells bogofilter to generate an R data frame. The data frame
  contains one row per token analyzed. Each such row contains the token, the sum
  of its database &quot;good&quot; and &quot;spam&quot; counts, the
  &quot;good&quot; count divided by the number of non-spam messages used to
  create the training database, the &quot;spam&quot; count divided by the spam
  message count, Robinson's f(w) for the token, the natural logs of (1 - f(w))
  and f(w), and an indicator character (+ if the token's f(w) value exceeded the
  minimum deviation from 0.5, - if it didn't). There is one additional row at
  the end of the table that contains a label in the token field, followed by the
  number of words actually used (the ones with + indicators), Robinson's P, Q,
  S, s and x values and the minimum deviation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The R data frame can be saved to a file and later read into an R session (see
  <b>the R project website</b>[5] for information about the mathematics package
  R). Provided with the bogofilter distribution is a simple R script (file
  bogo.R) that can be used to verify bogofilter's calculations. Instructions for
  its use are included in the script in the form of comments.

  MESSAGES</a></h1>
Bogofilter writes messages to the system log when the <b>-l</b> option is used.
  What is written depends on which other flags are used.

A classification run will generate (we are not showing the date and host part
  here):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
bogofilter[1412]: X-Bogosity: Ham, spamicity=0.000227
bogofilter[1415]: X-Bogosity: Spam, spamicity=0.998918
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using <b>-u</b> to classify a message and update a wordlist will produce (one a
  single line):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
bogofilter[1426]: X-Bogosity: Spam, spamicity=0.998918,
  register -s, 329 words, 1 messages
    
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Registering words ( <b>-l</b> and <b>-s</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-S</b>, or <b>-N</b>)
  will produce:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
bogofilter[1440]: register-n, 255 words, 1 messages
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A registration run (using <b>-s</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-N</b>, or <b>-S</b>) will
  generate messages like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
