<p>CWEBX(1) General Commands Manual CWEBX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ctanglex, cweavex - translate CWEB(x) to C (or C++) and/or
TeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ctanglex [ -bhpl ] [ +cs+ ] cwebfile[.w]
[(changefile[.ch]|+|-) [outputfile[.c]]] <br>
cweavex [ -bhpx ] [ +cs+dtefauwm ] [ +isearchpath ]
cwebfile[.w] [(changefile[.ch]|+|-) [outputfile[.tex]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ctanglex program converts a CWEB(x) source document into
a C program that may be compiled in the usual way. The
output file includes #line specifications so that error <br>
reporting and debugging can be done in terms of the CWEB(x)
source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cweavex program converts the
same CWEB(x) file into a TeX file that may be formatted and
printed in the usual way. It takes appropriate care of
typographic details like page <br>
layout and the use of indentation, italics, boldface, etc.,
and it supplies extensive cross-reference information that
it gathers automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CWEBx allows you to prepare a
single document containing all the information that is
needed both to produce a compilable C program and to produce
a well-formatted document <br>
describing the program in as much detail as the writer may
desire. The user of CWEBx ought to have some familiarity
with TeX as well as knowledge of C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line should have
one, two, or three names on it. The first is taken as the
CWEB(x) file (and &lsquo;.w&rsquo; is added if there is no
extension). If that file cannot be opened, <br>
the extension &lsquo;.web&rsquo; is tried instead. If there
is a second name, it is a change file (and &lsquo;.ch&rsquo;
is added if there is no extension), otherwise the name of
the CWEB(x) file with <br>
its extension replaced by &lsquo;.ch&rsquo; is tried as
change file name; if there no such file, no change file is
used. Instead of a change file one may specify
&lsquo;-&rsquo; or &lsquo;+&rsquo;; &lsquo;-&rsquo; means do
not <br>
use a change file, and &lsquo;+&rsquo; means use a change
file only if a file of the default name exists (just as if
only one name was given). The change file overrides parts of
the CWEB(x) <br>
file, as described in the documentation. A third name, if
present, specifies the output file name explicitly. The
default output file name is that of the CWEB(x) file with
exten&acirc; <br>
sion &lsquo;.c&rsquo; (for ctanglex ) or &lsquo;.tex&rsquo;
(for cweavex ); the default extension is also applied if a
third name is given without extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in the command line may
be either turned on with &lsquo;+&rsquo; and off with
&lsquo;-&rsquo;; several characters may follow in the same
argument, which indicate several options that are turned
<br>
on respectively off simultaneously. In fact, the options are
processed from left to right, so a sequence like &lsquo;-b
+b&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;+b&rsquo; (which is the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The +b option shows a banner
line on your terminal. The +h option shows a happy message
if the processing was successful. The +p option shows
progress reports (starred module <br>
numbers) as the processing takes place. If you say
&lsquo;-bhp&rsquo;, you get no terminal output but error
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The +c option emulates
Levy/Knuth CWEB. The +s option prints statistics about
memory usage at the end of a run (assuming that the programs
have been compiled with the -DSTAT <br>
switch, as they are by default on Debian systems). By
setting the option ++ one can select the C++ language
instead of C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -l is applicable to
ctanglex only; when selected, the C output is made more
readable for humans by omitting #line directives and
preserving layout and comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several other options
applicable to cweavex only. The option -x means omit the
index and table of contents. By setting the option +d one
causes cweavex to report prob&acirc; <br>
lems encountered in parsing the program fragments. With +t
the index and module names will be written to separate
files. With +e the table of contents is forced to start on a
new <br>
sheet when using a two-sided printer. The options +f , +a ,
+u , +w , and +m change the style in which programs are
formatted: +f means force a newline after every simple
state&acirc; <br>
ment in the formatted output, and +a means also force a
newline before every simple statement, even if it follows a
label or a condition; the option +u will change the style so
<br>
that a line break goes after &lsquo;{&rsquo; instead of
before, thus preventing them from aligning with their
matching &lsquo;}&rsquo; (this is the style of Levy/Knuth
CWEB), while the option +w puts a <br>
line break both before and after &lsquo;{&rsquo;, producing
a more symmetric layout at the expense of some extra paper.
Finally, the option +m avoids forcing line breaks between
successive <br>
declarations in a local block. With the option +isearchpath
one can specify a place to look for header files, when they
are not found in the current directory. The string
fol&acirc; <br>
lowing the &lsquo;+i&rsquo; will be stored and prepended to
a header file name if it cannot be found otherwise (so the
string should probably end with a pathname separator
&rsquo;/&rsquo;). More than <br>
one such search path can be specified; they will be tried in
order from left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/texmf/macros/litprog/cwebxmac.tex TeX macros used
by cweavex output. <br>
/usr/share/texmf/macros/litprog/cwebcmac.tex TeX macros used
in compatibility mode. <br>
/usr/share/texmf/macros/litprog/cwebhmac.tex TeX macros
which can be input after cwebxmac to produce hyperlinks in
the output. <br>
/usr/share/doc/cwebx/manual.tex The user manual source. <br>
/usr/share/doc/cwebx/manual.tex The user manual in DVI
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Literate Programming by D. E. Knuth. (CSLI, Stanford, 1992)
<br>
tex(1), cc(1), cweb(1) and web(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Don Knuth wrote WEB for TeX and Pascal. Silvio Levy designed
and developed CWEB by adapting the WEB conventions to C and
by recoding everything in CWEB. Frank Jensen adapted the
<br>
programs to ANSI/ISO C, and Marc van Leeuwen made numerous
changes for version x3.0, and wrote a new manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The syntactic support for C++ does not cover that language
completely, so formatting of complex C++ code may be
bad.</p>
