<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>ctanglex</b> program converts a CWEB(x) source document into a C program
  that may be compiled in the usual way. The output file includes <i>#line</i>
  specifications so that error reporting and debugging can be done in terms of
  the CWEB(x) source file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>cweavex</b> program converts the same CWEB(x) file into a TeX file that
  may be formatted and printed in the usual way. It takes appropriate care of
  typographic details like page layout and the use of indentation, italics,
  boldface, etc., and it supplies extensive cross-reference information that it
  gathers automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CWEBx allows you to prepare a single document containing all the information
  that is needed both to produce a compilable C program and to produce a
  well-formatted document describing the program in as much detail as the writer
  may desire. The user of CWEBx ought to have some familiarity with TeX as well
  as knowledge of C.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command line should have one, two, or three names on it. The first is taken
  as the CWEB(x) file (and ` <i>.w</i>' is added if there is no extension). If
  that file cannot be opened, the extension ` <i>.web</i>' is tried instead. If
  there is a second name, it is a change file (and ` <i>.ch</i>' is added if
  there is no extension), otherwise the name of the CWEB(x) file with its
  extension replaced by ` <i>.ch</i>' is tried as change file name; if there no
  such file, no change file is used. Instead of a change file one may specify `
  <b>-</b>' or ` <b>+</b>'; `<b>-</b>' means do not use a change file, and
  `<b>+</b>' means use a change file only if a file of the default name exists
  (just as if only one name was given). The change file overrides parts of the
  CWEB(x) file, as described in the documentation. A third name, if present,
  specifies the output file name explicitly. The default output file name is
  that of the CWEB(x) file with extension ` <i>.c</i>' (for <b>ctanglex</b> ) or
  ` <i>.tex</i>' (for <b>cweavex</b> ); the default extension is also applied if
  a third name is given without extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options in the command line may be either turned on with ` <b>+</b>' and off
  with ` <b>-</b>'; several characters may follow in the same argument, which
  indicate several options that are turned on respectively off simultaneously.
  In fact, the options are processed from left to right, so a sequence like `
  <b>-b +b</b>' is equivalent to `<b>+b</b>' (which is the default).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>+b</b> option shows a banner line on your terminal. The <b>+h</b> option
  shows a happy message if the processing was successful. The <b>+p</b> option
  shows progress reports (starred module numbers) as the processing takes place.
  If you say ` <b>-bhp</b>', you get no terminal output but error messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>+c</b> option emulates Levy/Knuth CWEB. The <b>+s</b> option prints
  statistics about memory usage at the end of a run (assuming that the programs
  have been compiled with the <i>-DSTAT</i> switch, as they are by default on
  Debian systems). By setting the option <b>++</b> one can select the C++
  language instead of C.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-l</b> is applicable to <b>ctanglex</b> only; when selected, the C
  output is made more readable for humans by omitting <b>#line</b> directives
  and preserving layout and comments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several other options applicable to <b>cweavex</b> only. The option
  <b>-x</b> means omit the index and table of contents. By setting the option
  <b>+d</b> one causes <b>cweavex</b> to report problems encountered in parsing
  the program fragments. With <b>+t</b> the index and module names will be
  written to separate files. With <b>+e</b> the table of contents is forced to
  start on a new sheet when using a two-sided printer. The options <b>+f</b> ,
  <b>+a</b> , <b>+u</b> , <b>+w</b> , and <b>+m</b> change the style in which
  programs are formatted: <b>+f</b> means force a newline after every simple
  statement in the formatted output, and <b>+a</b> means also force a newline
  before every simple statement, even if it follows a label or a condition; the
  option <b>+u</b> will change the style so that a line break goes after `{'
  instead of before, thus preventing them from aligning with their matching `}'
  (this is the style of Levy/Knuth CWEB), while the option <b>+w</b> puts a line
  break both before and after `{', producing a more symmetric layout at the
  expense of some extra paper. Finally, the option <b>+m</b> avoids forcing line
  breaks between successive declarations in a local block. With the option
  <b>+isearchpath</b> one can specify a place to look for header files, when
  they are not found in the current directory. The string following the `+i'
  will be stored and prepended to a header file name if it cannot be found
  otherwise (so the string should probably end with a pathname separator '/').
  More than one such search path can be specified; they will be tried in order
  from left to right.

Don Knuth wrote WEB for TeX and Pascal. Silvio Levy designed and developed CWEB
  by adapting the WEB conventions to C and by recoding everything in CWEB. Frank
  Jensen adapted the programs to ANSI/ISO C, and Marc van Leeuwen made numerous
  changes for version x3.0, and wrote a new manual.

The syntactic support for C++ does not cover that language completely, so
  formatting of complex C++ code may be bad.</div>
