<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nash - find nash equilibria of two person noncooperative
games</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
All Nash equilibria (NE) for a two person noncooperative
game are computed using two interleaved reverse search
vertex enumeration steps. The input for the problem are two
m by n <br>
matrices A,B of integers or rationals. The first player is
the row player, the second is the column player. If row i
and column j are played, player 1 receives Ai,j and player 2
<br>
receives Bi,j. If you have two or more cpus available run
2nash instead of nash as the order of the input games is
immaterial. It runs in parallel with the games in each
order. <br>
(If you use nash, the program usually runs faster if m is
&lt;= n , see below.) The easiest way to use the program
nash or 2nash is to first run setupnash or ( setupnash2 see
below <br>
) on a file containing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m n <br>
matrix A <br>
matrix B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eg. the file game is for a game
with m=3 n=2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 6 <br>
2 5 <br>
3 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 0 <br>
0 2 <br>
4 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% setupnash game game1 game2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces two H-representations,
game1 and game2, one for each player. To get the equilibria,
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% nash game1 game2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% 2nash game1 game2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each row beginning 1 is a
strategy for the row player yielding a NE with each row
beginning 2 listed immediately above it.The payoff for
player 2 is the last number on the line <br>
beginning 1, and vice versa. Eg: first two lines of output:
player 1 uses row probabilities 2/3 2/3 0 resulting in a
payoff of 2/3 to player 2.Player 2 uses column probabilities
<br>
1/3 2/3 yielding a payoff of 4 to player 1. If both matrices
are nonnegative and have no zero columns, you may instead
use setupnash2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% setupnash2 game game1
game2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now the polyhedra produced are
polytopes. The output of nash in this case is a list of
unscaled probability vectors x and y. To normalize, divide
each vector by v = 1^T x and <br>
u=1^T y.u and v are the payoffs to players 1 and 2
respectively. In this case, lower bounds on the payoff
functions to either or both players may be included. To give
a lower <br>
bound of r on the payoff for player 1 add the options to
file game2 (yes that is correct!)To give a lower bound of r
on the payoff for player 2 add the options to file game1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimize <br>
0 1 1 ... 1 (n entries to begiven) <br>
bound 1/r; ( note: reciprocal of r)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not wish to use the
2-cpu program 2nash, please read the following. If m is
greater than n then nash usually runs faster by transposing
the players. This is achieved by <br>
running:</p>

game1 and game2 files by hand, see the lrslib user
manual[1]</p>
