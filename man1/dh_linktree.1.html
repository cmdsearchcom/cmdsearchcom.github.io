dh_linktree - create symlink trees to embed files from other packages
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dh_linktree</b> [<i>debhelper&#x00A0;options</i>] [<b>-A</b>]
  [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [
  <i>action&#x00A0;source&#x00A0;destination</i>&#x00A0;...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dh_linktree</b> is a debhelper program that creates symlink trees in package
  build directories. The symlinks points to files provided by other packages and
  which have to be present during build. As such you have to put the packages
  providing the destination files in the build dependencies. For any symlink it
  creates, it will add to <b>${misc:Depends}</b> the dependency that is required
  to ensure that the target of the symlink is available.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
This tool has been developed to handle the case of embedded libraries written in
  interpreted languages (javascript, PHP, etc.). You usually want to replace the
  embedded copy by the packaged one except if they are not compatible. Since
  both versions evolve separately, you might have to frequently switch between
  the embedded version and the packaged one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the embedded library had been replaced by a symlink to the top-level
  directory, you would have to add code to the preinst/postinst every time that
  you switch from one to the other (to replace the real directory with a symlink
  and vice-versa). With a symlink tree, dpkg is doing everything by itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since symlink trees are created statically at build-time, they are not very
  future-proof and have a risk to miss some files introduced by a newer version
  of the package providing the file tree which is duplicated. That's why the
  generated dependencies generally ensure that the same upstream version be used
  at run-time than at build-time.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
<b>dh_linktree</b> accepts arguments by set of 3. One action followed by source
  and destination file/directories. Symlinking files works just like
  <b>dh_link</b> but symlinking directories will recreate the same directory
  hierarchy and all individual files will be turned into symlinks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The source files are the already existing files that will be symlinked from. The
  destination files are the symlinks that will be created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be sure you <b>do</b> specify the full filename to both the source and
  destination files (unlike what you would do if you were using something like
  <i>ln</i>(1)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dh_linktree</b> will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy:
  absolute when policy says they should be absolute, and relative links with as
  short a path as possible. It will also create any subdirectories it needs to
  to put the symlinks in.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>dh_linktree</b> will not be executed automatically by <b>dh</b>,
  you need to use <b>dh $@ --with linktree</b> to get it hooked in the list of
  dh_* commands automatically executed by <b>dh</b>.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;deduplicate&quot; action will not create new files but it will
      replace existing files in the destination directory with symlinks to the
      corresponding source file provided that both files have the same content.
      It generates a strong dependency.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;replace&quot; action is like &quot;deduplicate&quot; except that
      it does replace existing files even if their content is different from the
      content of the source files. It generates a weak dependency (&quot;at
      least the current upstream version&quot;) on the basis that you already
      assume that both version are compatible, otherwise you would have used
      &quot;deduplicate&quot; or &quot;embed&quot;.</dd>

Make <i>plugin-jquery</i> be a symlink tree to <i>jquery</i>.

<pre>
 dpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /some/file.
 [...]
 dh_linktree: error: dpkg --search -- /some/file [...] gave error exit status 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You get this error when the source tree contains files (here <i>/some/file</i>)
  that are not managed by dpkg. <b>dh_linktree</b> can't generate a correct
  dependency for a file that is unknown to dpkg and thus fails.
