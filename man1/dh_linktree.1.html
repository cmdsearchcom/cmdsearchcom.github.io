<p>DH_LINKTREE(1) dh_linktree 0.4 DH_LINKTREE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_linktree - create symlink trees to embed files from other
packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_linktree [debhelper options] [-A] [-Xitem] [action source
destination ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_linktree is a debhelper program that creates symlink
trees in package build directories. The symlinks points to
files provided by other packages and which have to be
present <br>
during build. As such you have to put the packages providing
the destination files in the build dependencies. For any
symlink it creates, it will add to ${misc:Depends} the <br>
dependency that is required to ensure that the target of the
symlink is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This tool has been developed to handle the case of embedded
libraries written in interpreted languages (javascript, PHP,
etc.). You usually want to replace the embedded copy by <br>
the packaged one except if they are not compatible. Since
both versions evolve separately, you might have to
frequently switch between the embedded version and the
packaged one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the embedded library had been
replaced by a symlink to the top-level directory, you would
have to add code to the preinst/postinst every time that you
switch from one to the <br>
other (to replace the real directory with a symlink and
vice-versa). With a symlink tree, dpkg is doing everything
by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since symlink trees are created
statically at build-time, they are not very future-proof and
have a risk to miss some files introduced by a newer version
of the package providing <br>
the file tree which is duplicated. That&rsquo;s why the
generated dependencies generally ensure that the same
upstream version be used at run-time than at build-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
dh_linktree accepts arguments by set of 3. One action
followed by source and destination file/directories.
Symlinking files works just like dh_link but symlinking
directories <br>
will recreate the same directory hierarchy and all
individual files will be turned into symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source files are the already
existing files that will be symlinked from. The destination
files are the symlinks that will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be sure you do specify the full
filename to both the source and destination files (unlike
what you would do if you were using something like
ln(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dh_linktree will generate
symlinks that comply with Debian policy: absolute when
policy says they should be absolute, and relative links with
as short a path as possible. It will <br>
also create any subdirectories it needs to to put the
symlinks in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that dh_linktree will not
be executed automatically by dh, you need to use dh $@
--with linktree to get it hooked in the list of dh_*
commands automatically executed by dh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/package.linktrees <br>
Lists source and destination trees to be symlinked. Each
line consists of 3 fields: the action, the source directory,
the destination directory. should be put on its own <br>
line, with the source and destination separated by
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Xitem, --exclude=item <br>
Do not create symlinks for files that contain item anywhere
in their filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">action source destination ...
<br>
If the action is &quot;embed&quot; create a symlink tree
named destination with all files within it pointing to the
corresponding file in source. It generates a strong
dependency <br>
(&quot;exactly same upstream version&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;deduplicate&quot;
action will not create new files but it will replace
existing files in the destination directory with symlinks to
the corresponding source file provided <br>
that both files have the same content. It generates a strong
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;replace&quot; action
is like &quot;deduplicate&quot; except that it does replace
existing files even if their content is different from the
content of the source files. It generates a <br>
weak dependency (&quot;at least the current upstream
version&quot;) on the basis that you already assume that
both version are compatible, otherwise you would have used
&quot;deduplicate&quot; <br>
or &quot;embed&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
dh_linktree embed usr/share/javascript/jquery
usr/share/wordpress/plugin-jquery</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make plugin-jquery be a symlink
tree to jquery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
dpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /some/file. <br>
[...] <br>
dh_linktree: error: dpkg --search -- /some/file [...] gave
error exit status 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You get this error when the
source tree contains files (here /some/file) that are not
managed by dpkg. dh_linktree can&rsquo;t generate a correct
dependency for a file that is unknown <br>
to dpkg and thus fails.</p>
