<p>NOTMUCH(1) notmuch NOTMUCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
notmuch - thread-based email index, search, and tagging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
notmuch [option ...] command [arg ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Notmuch is a command-line based program for indexing,
searching, reading, and tagging large collections of email
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This page describes how to get
started using notmuch from the command line, and gives a
brief overview of the commands available. For more
information on e.g. notmuch show con&acirc; <br>
sult the notmuch-show(1) man page, also accessible via
notmuch help show</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quickest way to get started
with Notmuch is to simply invoke the notmuch command with no
arguments, which will interactively guide you through the
process of indexing your <br>
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
While the command-line program notmuch provides powerful
functionality, it does not provide the most convenient
interface for that functionality. More sophisticated
interfaces <br>
are expected to be built on top of either the command-line
interface, or more likely, on top of the notmuch library
interface. See https://notmuchmail.org for more about
alter&acirc; <br>
nate interfaces to notmuch. The emacs-based interface to
notmuch (available under emacs/ in the Notmuch source
distribution) is probably the most widely used at this
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Supported global options for notmuch include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help [command-name] <br>
Print a synopsis of available commands and exit. With an
optional command name, show the man page for that
subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the installed version of notmuch, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config=FILE <br>
Specify the configuration file to use. This overrides any
configuration file specified by ${NOTMUCH_CONFIG}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uuid=HEX <br>
Enforce that the database UUID (a unique identifier which
persists until e.g. the database is compacted) is HEX; exit
with an error if it is not. This is useful to <br>
detect rollover in modification counts on messages. You can
find this UUID using e.g. notmuch count --lastmod</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All global options except
--config can also be specified after the command. For
example, notmuch subcommand --uuid=HEX is equivalent to
notmuch --uuid=HEX subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
SETUP <br>
The notmuch setup command is used to configure Notmuch for
first use, (or to reconfigure it later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The setup command will prompt
for your full name, your primary email address, any
alternate email addresses you use, and the directory
containing your email archives. Your <br>
answers will be written to a configuration file in
${NOTMUCH_CONFIG} (if set) or ${HOME}/.notmuch-config . This
configuration file will be created with descriptive
comments, mak&acirc; <br>
ing it easy to edit by hand later to change the
configuration. Or you can run notmuch setup again to change
the configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail directory you specify
can contain any number of sub-directories and should
primarily contain only files with individual email messages
(eg. maildir or mh archives are <br>
perfect). If there are other, non-email files (such as
indexes maintained by other email programs) then notmuch
will do its best to detect those and ignore them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail storage that uses mbox
format, (where one mbox file contains many messages), will
not work with notmuch. If that&rsquo;s how your mail is
currently stored, it is recommended you <br>
first convert it to maildir format with a utility such as
mb2md before running notmuch setup .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoking notmuch with no command
argument will run setup if the setup command has not
previously been completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER COMMANDS <br>
Several of the notmuch commands accept search terms with a
common syntax. See notmuch-search-terms(7) for more details
on the supported syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The search, show, address and
count commands are used to query the email database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reply command is useful for
preparing a template for an email reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tag command is the only
command available for manipulating database contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dump and restore commands
can be used to create a textual dump of email tags for
backup purposes, and to restore from that dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config command can be used
to get or set settings in the notmuch configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM COMMANDS <br>
If the given command is not known to notmuch, notmuch tries
to execute the external notmuch-&lt;subcommand&gt; in
${PATH} instead. This allows users to have their own notmuch
related <br>
tools to be run via the notmuch command. By design, this
does not allow notmuch&rsquo;s own commands to be overriden
using external commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables can be used to control
the behavior of notmuch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTMUCH_CONFIG <br>
Specifies the location of the notmuch configuration file.
Notmuch will use ${HOME}/.notmuch-config if this variable is
not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTMUCH_TALLOC_REPORT <br>
Location to write a talloc memory usage report. See
talloc_enable_leak_report_full in talloc(3) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTMUCH_DEBUG_QUERY <br>
If set to a non-empty value, the notmuch library will print
(to stderr) Xapian queries it constructs.</p>
