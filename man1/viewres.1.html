<p>VIEWRES(1) General Commands Manual VIEWRES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
viewres - graphical class browser for Xt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
viewres [-option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The viewres program displays a tree showing the widget class
hierarchy of the Athena Widget Set. Each node in the tree
can be expanded to show the resources that the
correspond&acirc; <br>
ing class adds (i.e. does not inherit from its parent) when
a widget is created. This application allows the user to
visually examine the structure and inherited resources for
<br>
the Athena Widget Set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Viewres accepts all of the standard toolkit command line
options as well as the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-top name <br>
This option specifies the name of the highest widget in the
hierarchy to display. This is typically used to limit the
display to a subset of the tree. The default is <br>
Object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-variable <br>
This option indicates that the widget variable names (as
declared in header files) should be displayed in the nodes
rather than the widget class name. This is sometimes <br>
useful to distinguish widget classes that share the same
name (such as Text).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vertical <br>
This option indicates that the tree should be displayed top
to bottom rather left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEW MENU <br>
The way in which the tree is displayed may be changed
through the entries in the View menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Variable Names <br>
This entry causes the node labels to be set to the variable
names used to declare the corresponding widget class. This
operation may also be performed with the SetLabel&acirc;
<br>
Type(variable) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Class Names <br>
This entry causes the node labels to be set to the class
names used when specifying resources. This operation may
also be performed with the SetLabelType(class)
transla&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout Horizontal <br>
This entry causes the tree to be laid out from left to
right. This operation may also be performed with the
SetOrientation(West) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout Vertical <br>
This entry causes the tree to be laid out from top to
bottom. This operation may also be performed with the
SetOrientation(North) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Resource Boxes <br>
This entry expands the selected nodes (see next section) to
show the new widget and constraint resources. This operation
may also be performed with the Resources(on) <br>
translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hide Resource Boxes <br>
This entry removes the resource displays from the selected
nodes (usually to conserve space). This operation may also
be performed with the Resources(off) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECT MENU <br>
Resources for a single widget class can be displayed by
clicking Button2 on the corresponding node, or by adding the
node to the selection list with Button1 and using the Show
<br>
Resource Boxes entry in the View menu. Since Button1
actually toggles the selection state of a node, clicking on
a selected node will cause it to be removed from the
selected <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Collections of nodes may also be
selected through the various entries in the Select menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unselect All <br>
This entry removes all nodes from the selection list. This
operation may also be performed with the Select(nothing)
translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select All <br>
This entry adds all nodes to the selection list. This
operation may also be performed with the Select(all)
translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invert All <br>
This entry adds unselected nodes to, and removes selected
nodes from, the selection list. This operation may also be
performed with the Select(invert) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Parent <br>
This entry selects the immediate parents of all selected
nodes. This operation may also be performed with the
Select(parent) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Ancestors <br>
This entry recursively selects all parents of all selected
nodes. This operation may also be performed with the
Select(ancestors) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Children <br>
This entry selects the immediate children of all selected
nodes. This operation may also be performed with the
Select(children) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Descendants <br>
This entry recursively selects all children of all selected
nodes. This operation may also be performed with the
Select(descendants) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Has Resources <br>
This entry selects all nodes that add new resources (regular
or constraint) to their corresponding widget classes. This
operation may also be performed with the <br>
Select(resources) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Shown Resource Boxes <br>
This entry selects all nodes whose resource boxes are
currently expanded (usually so that they can be closed with
Hide Resource Boxes). This operation may also be per&acirc;
<br>
formed with the Select(shown) translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
The following application actions are provided:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit() <br>
This action causes viewres to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SetLabelType(type) <br>
This action sets the node labels to display the widget
variable or class names, according to the argument type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SetOrientation(direction) <br>
This action sets the root of the tree to be one of the
following areas of the window: West, North, East, or
South.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select(what) <br>
This action selects the indicated nodes, as described in the
VIEW MENU section: nothing (unselects all nodes), invert,
parent, ancestors, children, descendants, <br>
resources, shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resources(op) <br>
This action turns on, off, or toggles the resource boxes for
the selected nodes. If invoked from within one of the nodes
(through the keyboard or pointer), only that <br>
node is used.</p>
