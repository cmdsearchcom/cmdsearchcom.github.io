<p>CR_CHECKPOINT(1) User Commands CR_CHECKPOINT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cr_checkpoint - checkpoints a process, process group, or
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cr_checkpoint [options] ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Invoking cr_checkpoint causes a process (with or without all
of its descendants), all processes within a process group,
or all processes within a session, to be checkpointed. <br>
The result is a checkpoint file (or a directory with one
checkpoint file per process) that contains all the state
needed to restart the process(es) at a later time.
Checkpointed <br>
processes can be restarted via cr_restart(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be checkpointed by
cr_checkpoint, a process must have the libcr.so library (or
one of its relatives) loaded. This can be achieved by
starting the program with cr_run(1), or <br>
by linking your application with -lcr. Or, the library may
be loaded by other libraries you have linked with (such as a
checkpoint-ready MPI library), or your system&rsquo;s
parallel <br>
job startup script, etc. Check your system documentation for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File creation/replacement <br>
By default (or if --atomic is passed) cr_checkpoint creates
the new context file/directory atomically: either the
checkpoint fails (and any existing context file/directory is
<br>
unchanged), or it appears in the directory ready to be used
by cr_restart. If an existing checkpoint with the same file
name exists, it will either be be unmodified (if the new
<br>
checkpoint fails for any reason), or replaced atomically
(via rename(2). If --backup[=NAME] is passed, any existing
checkpoint will be backed up instead, either to NAME or with
<br>
a numbered extension (.~1~, .~2~, etc., with more recent
checkpoints having higher numbers). If --clobber is passed,
the checkpoint will immediately remove any existing
check&acirc; <br>
point files, and will write the checkpoint directly out into
the target file/directory: this option uses less disk space
if an existing checkpoint is present, since the old <br>
checkpoint is immediately discarded, but if the checkpoint
fails, the pre-existing checkpoint is lost. Finally, if
--noclobber is passed, then the checkpoint will fail if the
<br>
target file/directory exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File sync <br>
By default (or when --sync is passed), cr_checkpoint waits
until the checkpoint is complete in memory, and additionally
calls fsync(2) on all files and directories involved in <br>
the checkpoint (including back-up files) to disk before
exiting. Passing --nosync causes these fsync calls to be
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timeout <br>
A maximum timeout in seconds can be set for a checkpoint via
the --time flag: if the checkpoint takes longer than this,
cr_checkpoint will print an error mesage and exit with an
<br>
error. If a timeout occurs, the state of the process or
processes that were being checkpointed is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals <br>
By default checkpointed processes continue to run after a
checkpoint is complete. Alternatively, you may specify that
they be stopped (via --stop), or terminated/aborted/killed
<br>
(via --term, --abort, or --kill). This is done by sending
the appropriate signal to every process that is part of the
checkpoint. If the processes were stopped at the time the
<br>
checkpoint was requested, then --cont may be used to send
SIGCONT to all processes after the checkpoint is
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory mapped files <br>
By default, checkpoints do not include any files that are
mmap()ed into the process address space unless they are
already unlinked at the time the checkpoint is taken. This
is a <br>
space/time saving optimization under the assumption that the
files required will still be present (and uncorrupted) at
restart time. Typically the largest savings comes from not
<br>
saving the executable file or dynamic (a.k.a shared)
libraries. However, options exist to cause the checkpoint to
save these files as well. The flag --save-exe will cause the
<br>
executable file to be included in the context file. The flag
--save-private will include in the context file any files
that are mapped with the MAP_PRIVATE flag, which under <br>
Linux includes the executable and dynamic/shared libaries.
The flag --save-shared is for saving files that are mapped
with the MAP_SHARED flag. Note that this is not the flag
<br>
you want for shared libraries. At restart any file saved by
these flags will be mapped into the process regardless of
whether any file exists at the original location. If there
<br>
is file at the original location it remains untouched by the
restart. Finally --save-all and --save-none will cause all
(or none) of these optional mmaped files to be saved. <br>
The default is --save-none. When passing multiple of these
options they are processed from left to right with all
options being additive, except for --save-none which cancels
<br>
the effects of any these options appearing earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checkpointing ptrace()ed
processes <br>
There is (currently) no way to fully transparently deal with
checkpoints of processes that are being traced with
ptrace(2). Therefore, the default behavior (also available
via <br>
--ptraced-error) is to return an error if any of the
processes to be checkpointed are currently being ptraced.
However, there are two other possible behaviors to choose
among:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ptraced-skip <br>
Ptraced processes will be siliently excluded from the
checkpoint. No error is generated unless this results in
zero processes checkpointed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ptraced-allow <br>
Ptraced processes will be checkpointed just like any other
processes. WARNING: Because the checkpointed process and the
BLCR kernel module must interact using signals and <br>
system calls, the debugger (or other tracer) may need to
&lsquo;continue&rsquo; the target process(es), possibly more
than once, to allow the checkpoint to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checkpointing ptrace()ing
processes <br>
There is (currently) no way to fully transparently deal with
checkpoints of processes that are tracing other processes
using ptrace(2). Therefore, the default behavior (also <br>
available via --ptracer-error) is to return an error if any
of the processes to be checkpointed are currently ptracing
other processes. However --ptracer-skip is available to <br>
cause cr_checkpoint to silently exclude such processes from
the checkpoint. No error is generated in that case unless
this would result in zero processes checkpointed.</p>
