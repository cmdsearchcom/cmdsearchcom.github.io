<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads list of objects from the standard input, and writes a
packed archive with specified base-name, or to the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A packed archive is an efficient
way to transfer a set of objects between two repositories as
well as an access efficient archival format. In a packed
archive, an object is <br>
either stored as a compressed whole or as a difference from
some other object. The latter is often called a delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packed archive format
(.pack) is designed to be self-contained so that it can be
unpacked without any further information. Therefore, each
object that a delta depends upon <br>
must be present within the pack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pack index file (.idx) is
generated for fast, random access to the objects in the
pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and the packed
archive (.pack) in the pack/ <br>
subdirectory of $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any of the
directories on $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables
Git to read from the pack archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The git unpack-objects command
can read the packed archive and expand the objects contained
in the pack into &quot;one-file one-object&quot; format;
this is typically done by the <br>
smart-pull commands when a pack is created on-the-fly for
efficient network transport by their peers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
base-name <br>
Write into a pair of files (.pack and .idx), using
&lt;base-name&gt; to determine the name of the created file.
When this option is used, the two files are written in <br>
&lt;base-name&gt;-&lt;SHA-1&gt;.{pack,idx} files.
&lt;SHA-1&gt; is a hash of the sorted object names to make
the resulting filename based on the pack content, and
written to the standard <br>
output of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdout <br>
Write the pack contents (what would have been written to
.pack file) out to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--revs <br>
Read the revision arguments from the standard input, instead
of individual object names. The revision arguments are
processed the same way as git rev-list with the --objects
<br>
flag uses its commit arguments to build the list of objects
it outputs. The objects on the resulting list are
packed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unpacked <br>
This implies --revs. When processing the list of revision
arguments read from the standard input, limit the objects
packed to those that are not already packed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
This implies --revs. In addition to the list of revision
arguments read from the standard input, pretend as if all
refs under refs/ are specified to be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-tag <br>
Include unasked-for annotated tags if the object they
reference was included in the resulting packfile. This can
be useful to send new tags to native Git clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--window=&lt;n&gt;,
--depth=&lt;n&gt; <br>
These two options affect how the objects contained in the
pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are
first internally sorted by type, size and optionally names
<br>
and compared against the other objects within --window to
see if using delta compression saves space. --depth limits
the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the <br>
performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs
to be applied that many times to get to the necessary
object. The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is
<br>
50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--window-memory=&lt;n&gt; <br>
This option provides an additional limit on top of --window;
the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not
take up more than &lt;n&gt; bytes in memory. This is useful
in <br>
repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not
run out of memory with a large window, but still be able to
take advantage of the large window for the smaller <br>
objects. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. --window-memory=0 makes
memory usage unlimited, which is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Maximum size of each output pack file. The size can be
suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or
&quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB.
If specified, multiple packfiles may be <br>
created. The default is unlimited, unless the config
variable pack.packSizeLimit is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--honor-pack-keep <br>
This flag causes an object already in a local pack that has
a .keep file to be ignored, even if it would have otherwise
been packed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incremental <br>
This flag causes an object already in a pack to be ignored
even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local <br>
This flag causes an object that is borrowed from an
alternate object store to be ignored even if it would have
otherwise been packed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-empty <br>
Only create a packed archive if it would contain at least
one object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress <br>
Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by
default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is
specified. This flag forces progress status even if the <br>
standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all-progress <br>
When --stdout is specified then progress report is displayed
during the object count and compression phases but inhibited
during the write-out phase. The reason is that in <br>
some cases the output stream is directly linked to another
command which may wish to display progress status of its own
as it processes incoming pack data. This flag is like <br>
--progress except that it forces progress report for the
write-out phase as well even if --stdout is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all-progress-implied <br>
This is used to imply --all-progress whenever progress
display is activated. Unlike --all-progress this flag
doesn&acirc;t actually force any progress display by
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
This flag makes the command not to report its progress on
the standard error stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-reuse-delta <br>
When creating a packed archive in a repository that has
existing packs, the command reuses existing deltas. This
sometimes results in a slightly suboptimal pack. This flag
<br>
tells the command not to reuse existing deltas but compute
them from scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-reuse-object <br>
This flag tells the command not to reuse existing object
data at all, including non deltified object, forcing
recompression of everything. This implies --no-reuse-delta.
<br>
Useful only in the obscure case where wholesale enforcement
of a different compression level on the packed data is
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compression=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Specifies compression level for newly-compressed data in the
generated pack. If not specified, pack compression level is
determined first by pack.compression, then by <br>
core.compression, and defaults to -1, the zlib default, if
neither is set. Add --no-reuse-object if you want to force a
uniform compression level on all data no matter the <br>
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--thin <br>
Create a &quot;thin&quot; pack by omitting the common
objects between a sender and a receiver in order to reduce
network transfer. This option only makes sense in
conjunction with <br>
--stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: A thin pack violates the
packed archive format by omitting required objects and is
thus unusable by Git without making it self-contained. Use
git index-pack --fix-thin <br>
(see git-index-pack(1)) to restore the self-contained
property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delta-base-offset <br>
A packed archive can express the base object of a delta as
either a 20-byte object name or as an offset in the stream,
but ancient versions of Git don&acirc;t understand the <br>
latter. By default, git pack-objects only uses the former
format for better compatibility. This option allows the
command to use the latter format for compactness. Depending
<br>
on the average delta chain length, this option typically
shrinks the resulting packfile by 3-5 per-cent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Porcelain commands such as
git gc (see git-gc(1)), git repack (see git-repack(1)) pass
this option by default in modern Git when they put objects
in your repository <br>
into pack files. So does git bundle (see git-bundle(1)) when
it creates a bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--threads=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for
best delta matches. This requires that pack-objects be
compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored <br>
with a warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on
multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory for
the delta search window is however multiplied by the number
<br>
of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the
number of CPU&acirc;s and set the number of threads
accordingly.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
<br>
This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It
allows to force the version for the generated pack index,
and to force 64-bit index entries on objects located above
<br>
the given offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-true-parents <br>
With this option, parents that are hidden by grafts are
packed nevertheless.</p>
