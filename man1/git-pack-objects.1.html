<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Reads list of objects from the standard input, and writes a packed archive with
  specified base-name, or to the standard output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A packed archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects between two
  repositories as well as an access efficient archival format. In a packed
  archive, an object is either stored as a compressed whole or as a difference
  from some other object. The latter is often called a delta.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The packed archive format (.pack) is designed to be self-contained so that it
  can be unpacked without any further information. Therefore, each object that a
  delta depends upon must be present within the pack.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A pack index file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to the objects in
  the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and the packed archive (.pack) in
  the pack/ subdirectory of $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any of the directories on
  $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git to read from the pack archive.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>git unpack-objects</i> command can read the packed archive and expand the
  objects contained in the pack into &quot;one-file one-object&quot; format;
  this is typically done by the smart-pull commands when a pack is created
  on-the-fly for efficient network transport by their peers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
base-name
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write into a pair of files (.pack and .idx),
  using &lt;base-name&gt; to determine the name of the created file. When this
  option is used, the two files are written in
  &lt;base-name&gt;-&lt;SHA-1&gt;.{pack,idx} files. &lt;SHA-1&gt; is a hash of
  the sorted object names to make the resulting filename based on the pack
  content, and written to the standard output of the command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--stdout
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write the pack contents (what would have been
  written to .pack file) out to the standard output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--revs
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Read the revision arguments from the standard
  input, instead of individual object names. The revision arguments are
  processed the same way as <i>git rev-list</i> with the --objects flag uses its
  commit arguments to build the list of objects it outputs. The objects on the
  resulting list are packed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--unpacked
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This implies --revs. When processing the list
  of revision arguments read from the standard input, limit the objects packed
  to those that are not already packed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--all
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This implies --revs. In addition to the list
  of revision arguments read from the standard input, pretend as if all refs
  under refs/ are specified to be included.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--include-tag
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Include unasked-for annotated tags if the
  object they reference was included in the resulting packfile. This can be
  useful to send new tags to native Git clients.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--window=&lt;n&gt;, --depth=&lt;n&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">These two options affect how the objects
  contained in the pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are
  first internally sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared
  against the other objects within --window to see if using delta compression
  saves space. --depth limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep
  affects the performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be
  applied that many times to get to the necessary object. The default value for
  --window is 10 and --depth is 50.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--window-memory=&lt;n&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option provides an additional limit on
  top of --window; the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take
  up more than <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful in repositories
  with a mix of large and small objects to not run out of memory with a large
  window, but still be able to take advantage of the large window for the
  smaller objects. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
  or &quot;g&quot;. --window-memory=0 makes memory usage unlimited, which is the
  default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--max-pack-size=&lt;n&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Maximum size of each output pack file. The
  size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The
  minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. If specified, multiple packfiles may
  be created. The default is unlimited, unless the config variable
  pack.packSizeLimit is set.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--honor-pack-keep
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This flag causes an object already in a local
  pack that has a .keep file to be ignored, even if it would have otherwise been
  packed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--incremental
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This flag causes an object already in a pack
  to be ignored even if it would have otherwise been packed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--local
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This flag causes an object that is borrowed
  from an alternate object store to be ignored even if it would have otherwise
  been packed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--non-empty
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Only create a packed archive if it would
  contain at least one object.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--progress
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Progress status is reported on the standard
  error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is
  specified. This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream
  is not directed to a terminal.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--all-progress
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When --stdout is specified then progress
  report is displayed during the object count and compression phases but
  inhibited during the write-out phase. The reason is that in some cases the
  output stream is directly linked to another command which may wish to display
  progress status of its own as it processes incoming pack data. This flag is
  like --progress except that it forces progress report for the write-out phase
  as well even if --stdout is used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--all-progress-implied
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is used to imply --all-progress whenever
  progress display is activated. Unlike --all-progress this flag doesn&#x2019;t
  actually force any progress display by itself.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-q
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This flag makes the command not to report its
  progress on the standard error stream.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--no-reuse-delta
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When creating a packed archive in a repository
  that has existing packs, the command reuses existing deltas. This sometimes
  results in a slightly suboptimal pack. This flag tells the command not to
  reuse existing deltas but compute them from scratch.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--no-reuse-object
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This flag tells the command not to reuse
  existing object data at all, including non deltified object, forcing
  recompression of everything. This implies --no-reuse-delta. Useful only in the
  obscure case where wholesale enforcement of a different compression level on
  the packed data is desired.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--compression=&lt;n&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies compression level for
  newly-compressed data in the generated pack. If not specified, pack
  compression level is determined first by pack.compression, then by
  core.compression, and defaults to -1, the zlib default, if neither is set. Add
  --no-reuse-object if you want to force a uniform compression level on all data
  no matter the source.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--thin
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Create a &quot;thin&quot; pack by omitting the
  common objects between a sender and a receiver in order to reduce network
  transfer. This option only makes sense in conjunction with --stdout.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: A thin pack violates the packed archive format by omitting required
  objects and is thus unusable by Git without making it self-contained. Use git
  index-pack --fix-thin (see <b>git-index-pack</b>(1)) to restore the
  self-contained property.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--delta-base-offset
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A packed archive can express the base object
  of a delta as either a 20-byte object name or as an offset in the stream, but
  ancient versions of Git don&#x2019;t understand the latter. By default, <i>git
  pack-objects</i> only uses the former format for better compatibility. This
  option allows the command to use the latter format for compactness. Depending
  on the average delta chain length, this option typically shrinks the resulting
  packfile by 3-5 per-cent.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: Porcelain commands such as git gc (see <b>git-gc</b>(1)), git repack (see
  <b>git-repack</b>(1)) pass this option by default in modern Git when they put
  objects in your repository into pack files. So does git bundle (see
  <b>git-bundle</b>(1)) when it creates a bundle.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--threads=&lt;n&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the number of threads to spawn when
  searching for best delta matches. This requires that pack-objects be compiled
  with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant
  to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of
  memory for the delta search window is however multiplied by the number of
  threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU&#x2019;s
  and set the number of threads accordingly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is intended to be used by the test suite
  only. It allows to force the version for the generated pack index, and to
  force 64-bit index entries on objects located above the given offset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
--keep-true-parents
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">With this option, parents that are hidden by
  grafts are packed nevertheless.</div>
