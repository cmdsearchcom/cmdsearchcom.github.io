<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.watershed generates a set of maps indicating: 1) flow
accumulation, drainage direction, the location of streams
and watershed basins, and 2) the LS and S factors of the
Revised <br>
Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Without flag -m set, the entire analysis is run in memory
maintained by the operating system. This can be limiting,
but is very fast. Setting this flag causes the program to
man&acirc; <br>
age memory on disk which allows very large maps to be
processed but is slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flag -s force the module to use
single flow direction (SFD, D8) instead of multiple flow
direction (MFD). MFD is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By -4 flag the user allow only
horizontal and vertical flow of water. Stream and slope
lengths are approximately the same as outputs from default
surface flow (allows horizontal, <br>
vertical, and diagonal flow of water). This flag will also
make the drainage basins look more homogeneous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -a flag is specified the
module will use positive flow accumulation even for likely
underestimates. When this flag is not set, cells with a flow
accumulation value that is <br>
likely to be an underestimate are converted to the negative.
See below for a detailed description of flow accumulation
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option convergence specifies
convergence factor for MFD. Lower values result in higher
divergence, flow is more widely distributed. Higher values
result in higher convergence, <br>
flow is less widely distributed, becoming more similar to
SFD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option elevation specifies the
elevation data on which entire analysis is based. NULL
(nodata) cells are ignored, zero and negative values are
valid elevation data. Gaps in the <br>
elevation map that are located within the area of interest
must be filled beforehand, e.g. with r.fillnulls, to avoid
distortions. The elevation map need not be sink-filled <br>
because the module uses a least-cost algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option depression specifies the
optional map of actual depressions or sinkholes in the
landscape that are large enough to slow and store surface
runoff from a storm event. All <br>
cells that are not NULL and not zero indicate depressions.
Water will flow into but not out of depressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster flow map specifies amount
of overland flow per cell. This map indicates the amount of
overland flow units that each cell will contribute to the
watershed basin model. <br>
Overland flow units represent the amount of overland flow
each cell contributes to surface flow. If omitted, a value
of one (1) is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Raster map or value
containing the percent of disturbed land (i.e., croplands,
and construction sites) where the raster or input value of
17 equals 17%. If no map or value <br>
is given, r.watershed assumes no disturbed land. This input
is used for the RUSLE calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option blocking specifies
terrain that will block overland surface flow. Blocking
cells and streams stop the slope length for the RUSLE. All
cells that are not NULL and not zero <br>
indicate blocking terrain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option threshold specifies the
minimum size of an exterior watershed basin in cells, if no
flow map is input, or overland flow units when a flow map is
given. Warning: low <br>
threshold values will dramactically increase run time and
generate difficult to read basin and half_basin results.
This parameter also controls the level of detail in the
stream <br>
segments map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value given by max_slope_length
option indicates the maximum length of overland surface flow
in meters. If overland flow travels greater than the maximum
length, the program <br>
assumes the maximum length (it assumes that landscape
characteristics not discernible in the digital elevation
model exist that maximize the slope length). This input is
used <br>
for the RUSLE calculations and is a sensitive parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output accumulation map contains
the absolute value of each cell in this output map is the
amount of overland flow that traverses the cell. This value
will be the number of <br>
upland cells plus one if no overland flow map is given. If
the overland flow map is given, the value will be in
overland flow units. Negative numbers indicate that those
cells <br>
possibly have surface runoff from outside of the current
geographic region. Thus, any cells with negative values
cannot have their surface runoff and sedimentation yields
calcu&acirc; <br>
lated accurately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output tci raster map contains
topographic index TCI, computed as ln(&amp;#945; /
tan(&amp;#946;)) where &amp;#945; is the cumulative upslope
area draining through a point per unit contour <br>
length and tan(&amp;#946;) is the local slope angle. The TCI
reflects the tendency of water to accumulate at any point in
the catchment and the tendency for gravitational forces to
<br>
move that water downslope (Quinn et al. 1991). This value
will be negative if &amp;#945; / tan(&amp;#946;) &lt; 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output spi raster map contains
stream power index SPI, computed as &amp;#945; *
tan(&amp;#946;) where &amp;#945; is the cumulative upslope
area draining through a point per unit contour <br>
length and tan(&amp;#946;) is the local slope angle. The SPI
reflects the power of water flow at any point in the
catchment and the tendency for gravitational forces to move
that <br>
water downslope (Moore et al. 1991). This value will be
negative if &amp;#945; &lt; 0, i.e. for cells with possible
surface runoff from outside of the current geographic
region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output drainage raster map
contains drainage direction. Provides the &quot;aspect&quot;
for each cell measured CCW from East. Multiplying positive
values by 45 will give the direction in <br>
degrees that the surface runoff will travel from that cell.
The value 0 (zero) indicates that the cell is a depression
area (defined by the depression input map). Negative
val&acirc; <br>
ues indicate that surface runoff is leaving the boundaries
of the current geographic region. The absolute value of
these negative cells indicates the direction of flow. For
MFD, <br>
drainage indicates the direction of maximum flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output basin map contains
unique label for each watershed basin. Each basin will be
given a unique positive even integer. Areas along edges may
not be large enough to create <br>
an exterior watershed basin. NULL values indicate that the
cell is not part of a complete watershed basin in the
current geographic region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output stream contains
stream segments. Values correspond to the watershed basin
values. Can be vectorized after thinning (r.thin) with
r.to.vect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output half_basin raster map
stores each half-basin is given a unique value. Watershed
basins are divided into left and right sides. The right-hand
side cell of the watershed <br>
basin (looking upstream) are given even values corresponding
to the values in basin. The left-hand side cells of the
watershed basin are given odd values which are one less than
<br>
the value of the watershed basin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output length_slope raster
map stores slope length and steepness (LS) factor for the
Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Equations
taken from Revised Universal <br>
Soil Loss Equation for Western Rangelands (Weltz et al.
1987). Since the LS factor is a small number (usually less
than one), the GRASS output map is of type DCELL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output slope_steepness
raster map stores slope steepness (S) factor for the
Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Equations taken from
article entitled Revised Slope Steep&acirc; <br>
ness Factor for the Universal Soil Loss Equation (McCool et
al. 1987). Since the S factor is a small number (usually
less than one), the GRASS output map is of type DCELL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AT least-cost search algorithm
<br>
r.watershed uses an AT least-cost search algorithm (see
REFERENCES section) designed to minimize the impact of DEM
data errors. Compared to r.terraflow, this algorithm
provides <br>
more accurate results in areas of low slope as well as DEMs
constructed with techniques that mistake canopy tops as the
ground elevation. Kinner et al. (2005), for example, used
<br>
SRTM and IFSAR DEMs to compare r.watershed against
r.terraflow results in Panama. r.terraflow was unable to
replicate stream locations in the larger valleys while
r.watershed <br>
performed much better. Thus, if forest canopy exists in
valleys, SRTM, IFSAR, and similar data products will cause
major errors in r.terraflow stream output. Under similar
condi&acirc; <br>
tions, r.watershed will generate better stream and
half_basin results. If watershed divides contain flat to low
slope, r.watershed will generate better basin results than
r.ter&acirc; <br>
raflow. (r.terraflow uses the same type of algorithm as
ESRI&acirc;s ArcGIS watershed software which fails under
these conditions.) Also, if watershed divides contain forest
canopy <br>
mixed with uncanopied areas using SRTM, IFSAR, and similar
data products, r.watershed will generate better basin
results than r.terraflow. The algorithm produces results
similar <br>
to those obtained when running r.cost and r.drain on every
cell on the raster map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple flow direction (MFD)
<br>
r.watershed offers two methods to calculate surface flow:
single flow direction (SFD, D8) and multiple flow direction
(MFD). With MFD, water flow is distributed to all
neighbour&acirc; <br>
ing cells with lower elevation, using slope towards
neighbouring cells as a weighing factor for proportional
distribution. The AT least-cost path is always included. As
a result, <br>
depressions and obstacles are traversed with a gracefull
flow convergence before the overflow. The convergence factor
causes flow accumulation to converge more strongly with <br>
higher values. The supported range is 1 to 10, recommended
is a convergence factor of 5 (Holmgren, 1994). If many small
sliver basins are created with MFD, setting the
conver&acirc; <br>
gence factor to a higher value can reduce the amount of
small sliver basins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In-memory mode and disk swap
mode <br>
There are two versions of this program: ram and seg. ram is
used by default, seg can be used by setting the -m flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ram version requires a
maximum of 31 MB of RAM for 1 million cells. Together with
the amount of system memory (RAM) available, this value can
be used to estimate whether the <br>
current region can be processed with the ram version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ram version uses virtual
memory managed by the operating system to store all the data
structures and is faster than the seg version; seg uses the
GRASS segmentation library <br>
which manages data in disk files. seg uses only as much
system memory (RAM) as specified with the memory option,
allowing other processes to operate on the same system, even
when <br>
the current geographic region is huge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to memory requirements of
both programs, it is quite easy to run out of memory when
working with huge map regions. If the ram version runs out
of memory and the resolution <br>
size of the current geographic region cannot be increased,
either more memory needs to be added to the computer, or the
swap space size needs to be increased. If seg runs out of
<br>
memory, additional disk space needs to be freed up for the
program to run. The r.terraflow module was specifically
designed with huge regions in mind and may be useful here as
<br>
an alternative, although disk space requirements of
r.terraflow are several times higher than of seg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Large regions with many cells
<br>
The upper limit of the ram version is 2 billion (231 - 1)
cells, whereas the upper limit for the seg version is 9
billion-billion (263 - 1 = 9.223372e+18) cells. <br>
In some situations, the region size (number of cells) may be
too large for the amount of time or memory available.
Running r.watershed may then require use of a coarser
resolu&acirc; <br>
tion. To make the results more closely resemble the finer
terrain data, create a map layer containing the lowest
elevation values at the coarser resolution. This is done by:
1) <br>
Setting the current geographic region equal to the elevation
map layer with g.region, and 2) Use the r.neighbors or
r.resamp.stats command to find the lowest value for an area
<br>
equal in size to the desired resolution. For example, if the
resolution of the elevation data is 30 meters and the
resolution of the geographic region for r.watershed will be
90 <br>
meters: use the minimum function for a 3 by 3 neighborhood.
After changing to the resolution at which r.watershed will
be run, r.watershed should be run using the values from the
<br>
neighborhood output map layer that represents the minimum
elevation within the region of the coarser cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basin threshold <br>
The minimum size of drainage basins, defined by the
threshold parameter, is only relevant for those watersheds
with a single stream having at least the threshold of cells
flowing <br>
into it. (These watersheds are called exterior basins.)
Interior drainage basins contain stream segments below
multiple tributaries. Interior drainage basins can be of any
<br>
size because the length of an interior stream segment is
determined by the distance between the tributaries flowing
into it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MASK and no data <br>
The r.watershed program does not require the user to have
the current geographic region filled with elevation values.
Areas without elevation data (masked or NULL cells) are <br>
ignored. It is NOT necessary to create a raster map (or
raster reclassification) named MASK for NULL cells. Areas
without elevation data will be treated as if they are off
the <br>
edge of the region. Such areas will reduce the memory
necessary to run the program. Masking out unimportant areas
can significantly reduce processing time if the watersheds
of <br>
interest occupy a small percentage of the overall area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gaps (NULL cells) in the
elevation map that are located within the area of interest
will heavily influence the analysis: water will flow into
but not out of these gaps. These <br>
gaps must be filled beforehand, e.g. with r.fillnulls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zero (0) and negative values
will be treated as elevation data (not no_data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further processing of output
layers <br>
Problem areas, i.e. those parts of a basin with a likely
underestimate of flow accumulation, can be easily identified
with e.g. <br>
r.mapcalc &quot;problems = if(flow_acc &lt; 0, basin,
null())&quot; <br>
If the region of interest contains such problem areas, and
this is not desired, the computational region must be
expanded until the catchment area for the region of interest
is <br>
completely included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To isolate an individual river
network using the output of this module, a number of
approaches may be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Use a resample of the basins
catchment raster map as a MASK. <br>
The equivalent vector map method is similar using v.select
or v.overlay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Use the r.cost module with a
point in the river as a starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Use the v.net.iso module with
a node in the river as a starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All individual river networks in
the stream segments output can be identified through their
ultimate outlet points. These points are all cells in the
stream segments output with <br>
negative drainage direction. These points can be used as
start points for r.water.outlet or v.net.iso.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create river mile
segmentation from a vectorized streams map, try the
v.net.iso or v.lrs.segment modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stream segments output can
be easily vectorized after thinning with r.thin. Each stream
segment in the vector map will have the value of the
associated basin. To isolate sub&acirc; <br>
basins and streams for a larger basin, a MASK for the larger
basin can be created with r.water.outlet. The stream
segments output serves as a guide where to place the outlet
<br>
point used as input to r.water.outlet. The basin threshold
must have been sufficiently small to isolate a stream
network and subbasins within the larger basin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
These examples use the Spearfish sample dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convert r.watershed streams map
output to a vector map <br>
If you want a detailed stream network, set the threshold
option small to create lots of catchment basins, as only one
stream is presented per catchment. The r.to.vect -v flag
<br>
preserves the catchment ID as the vector category number.
<br>
r.watershed elev=elevation.dem stream=rwater.stream <br>
r.to.vect -v in=rwater.stream out=rwater_stream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set a different color table for
