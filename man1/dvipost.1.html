<p>dvipost(1) General Commands Manual dvipost(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvipost, pptex, pplatex - post processing of dvi files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvipost [-debug] [-version] [-help] in out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pplatex [-debug] [-version]
[-help] [LaTeX-Arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pptex [-debug] [-version]
[-help] [TeX-Arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The command dvipost is a post procesor for dvi files,
created by latex or tex. It is used for special modes, which
normally needs the support of dvi drivers (such as dvips).
With <br>
dvipost, this features could be implemented independent of
the prefered driver. Currently, the post processor supports
layout raster, change bars and overstrike mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of dvipost does not
seek the dvi file, so it could be used as a filter. If - is
given as file name, the command uses standard input or
standard output respective. <br>
The command does not substitute a missing .dvi extension to
the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the command works with a
temporary file and creates the ouput file only after
successfull processing the input file, it is possible to use
the same name for input and <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command is renamed or
linked to pplatex/pptex, it runs latex/tex and post
processes the createt output. If the name of the dvi file
could not be determined by the argu&acirc; <br>
ments to latex/tex (e.g. on an interactive run), the command
processes all dvi files in the current directory with a
modification time later than the run of latex/tex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basics <br>
If the filter is used in context of LaTeX, the style file
dvipost.sty should be included in the LaTeX source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter interpretes dvi
extensions in the form of <br>
dvipost: name [arg] <br>
where arg depends on the command name and may be separated
from name by = or space. All other extensions are not
interpreted by dvipost and remain in the dvi file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such a dvipost command could be
placed with the TeX primitive <br>
cial{dvipost: cmd} <br>
or the LaTeX macro (provided by dvipost.sty) <br>
vipost{cmd} <br>
in the dvi file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the type of dvipost
commands, the following kinds of arguments may be used: <br>
length is a floating point number followed by a unit
specification. The following units are supportet by
divipost: pt, in, cm and mm. If no argument is given or the
unit speci&acirc; <br>
fication is missing, the corresponding length is set to 0.
<br>
string is an arbitrary string argument. <br>
flag is an integer argument, where a value different from 0
(usually 1) means true and a missing value or 0 means false.
<br>
depth is an integer argument, where a value different from 0
(usually 1) increments a depth counter and a missing value
or 0 decrements it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change bars <br>
All text printed with change mode level higher than 0 is
marked with a change bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following LaTeX macros
modifies the change mode level:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">increments the change mode
level. <br>
decrements the change mode level. <br>
extchanged{text} <br>
increments the change mode level for text only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following dvipost commands
are used in context of change bars: <br>
cbmode depth <br>
increments/decrements the change mode level. This command is
used by the LaTeX macros. <br>
cbrule length <br>
determines the thickness of the change bar. The default
value is 2pt. <br>
cbsep length <br>
sets the distance beetween page margin and change bar. The
default value is 2pt. <br>
cbexp length <br>
sets the additional height and depth of a character in
calculating the change bar positions. The default value is
6pt. <br>
cbstart string <br>
places the dvi extension string before printing characters
in change mode. <br>
cbend string <br>
places the dvi extension string after printing characters in
change mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of cbstart and cbend
allows to set additional attributes to the marked text,
depending on the dvi driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If dvips is used as dvi driver
and the preamble of the LaTeX source contains <br>
sepackage{dvipost} <br>
vipost{cbstart color push Blue} <br>
vipost{cbend color pop} <br>
the marked text is colored blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overstrike mode <br>
All text printed with overstrike level higher than 0 is
overstriked with a horizontal line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The overstrike line is
positioned at the mean height of every block of text not
broken by vertical movements and font changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following LaTeX macros
modifies the overstrike level: n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">increments the overstrike level.
f <br>
decrements the overstrike level. } <br>
increments the overstrike level for text only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following dvipost commands
are used in context of overstrike mode: <br>
osmode depth <br>
increments/decrements the overstrike level. This command is
used by the LaTeX macros. <br>
osrule length <br>
sets the thickness of the overstrike line to length. The
default value is oxrule. <br>
osstart string <br>
places the dvi extension string before change of overstrike
mode. <br>
osend string <br>
places the dvi extension string after change of overstrike
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of osstart and osend is
similar to cbstart and cbend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout parameters <br>
Layout parameters are transfered to the dvi file on loading
the style file. If any changes are made to layout
parameters, like \vensidemargin, the macro vipostlayout must
be <br>
called to get the correct placement of change bars.
Additional calls to vipostlayout are harmeless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following layout parameters
are transfered to the dvi file: fset, fset, extwidth,
extheight, sidemargin, \vensidemargin, opmargin, dheight,
dsep, <br>
otskip, rginparsep and rginparwidth. Additional the flag
twoside is set to 0 or 1, depending on the document style
option twoside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of calling vipostlayout,
partciucular values could be set. The command <br>
vipost{evensidemargin=he\vensidemargin} <br>
transfers the actual setting of \vensidemargin to the dvi
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dvipost command allows the
printing of the layout raster by setting layout to a length
different to 0. The value of layout is used as the thickness
of the raster lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: The command <br>
vipost{layout=heoxrule} <br>
activates the layout raster and uses the same line thicknes
as frame boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The filter is primarly written for LaTeX. It could be used
for plain TeX, but currently there is no assistance style
file included in the distribution. Maybe somone would write
<br>
one, I am not a plain TeX user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current state of change bar
mode and overstrike mode must be committed do environments,
which are placed on different locations than the current
text. This is done in <br>
dvipost.sty by redefining <br>
If the macro otnoterule is redefined, it should start with
the command vipost{footnote} for a correct handling of
overstrike mode and change bars.</p>
