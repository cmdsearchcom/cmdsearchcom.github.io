ncdc - Ncurses Direct Connect Client

ncdc [options]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Ncdc is a modern and lightweight direct connect client with a friendly ncurses
  interface.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
This is a basic introduction for those who are new to ncdc. See the chapters
  below for a more detailed description of the available functionality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
What you see when starting up ncdc is an input line where you can input commands
  and a log window where the results are displayed, much like a regular
  terminal. Commands within ncdc start with a slash (e.g. &quot;/help&quot;) and
  have tab completion to help you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first thing you will want to do after starting ncdc for the first time is to
  setup some basic information and settings:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /set nick MyNick
  /set description ncdc is awesome!
  /set connection 10
  /share &quot;My Awesome Files&quot; /path/to/files
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And if you have a direct connection to the internet or if your router allows
  port forwarding, you may also want to enable active mode:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /set active_port 34194
  /set active true
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the help text for each of the commands and settings for more information. Of
  course, all of the above settings are saved to the database and will be used
  again on the next run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To connect to a hub, use /open:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /open ncdc adc://dc.blicky.net:2780/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here <i>ncdc</i> is the personal name you give to the hub, and the second
  argument the URL. This URL will be saved in the database, so the next time you
  want to connect to this hub, you can simply do &quot;/open ncdc&quot;. See the
  help text for &quot;/open&quot; and &quot;/connect&quot; for more information.
  If you want to automatically connect to a hub when ncdc starts up, use the
  &quot;autoconnect&quot; setting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ncdc uses a tabbed interface: every hub opens in a new tab, and there are
  several other kinds of tabs available as well. The type of tab is indicated in
  the tab list on the bottom of the screen with a character prefix. Hubs, for
  example, are prefixed with a &quot;#&quot;. If a tab needs your attention, a
  colored exclamation mark is displayed before the tab name, different colors
  are used for different types of activity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Everything else should be fairly self-explanatory: To search for files, use the
  &quot;/search&quot; command. To browse through the user list of a hub, use
  &quot;/userlist&quot; or hit Alt+u. To browse someone's file list, use
  &quot;/browse&quot; or hit the 'b' key in the user list. And to monitor your
  upload and download connections, use &quot;/connections&quot; or hit Alt+n.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_CONNECTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_CONNECTED">GETTING
  CONNECTED</a></h1>
As with most file sharing clients, ncdc supports two modes of being connected:
  <i>active</i> and <i>passive</i>. In passive mode (the default), you can
  connect to the outside world but nobody can connect (directly) to you. When
  passive, you will only be able to transfer files with people who are in active
  mode. In active mode, however, you will have some port open to the rest of the
  network to which other clients can connect. When active, you will be able to
  transfer files with everyone and you may get more and faster search results.
  Configuring active mode is therefore recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In many setups, all you need to do to switch to active mode is to set a TCP/UDP
  port and enable the &quot;active&quot; setting:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /set active_port 34194
  /set active true
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you connect to a hub, the status bar will tell you whether you are active
  or passive on that particular hub, and what IP address is being used to allow
  others to connect to you. For most hubs, your IP address will be detected
  automatically, but in the event that this fails, you can also set it yourself:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /set active_ip 13.33.33.7
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are behind a NAT or firewall, you have to ensure that the port you
  configured is somehow allowed and/or forwarded. The &quot;active_port&quot;
  setting is used for incoming TCP connections and UDP messages. You can
  configure a different UDP port with the &quot;active_udp_port&quot; setting.
  Contrary to many toher Direct Connect clients, ncdc only uses a single port
  for incoming TCP and TLS connections; There is no separate port for TLS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;/listen&quot; command can tell you which ports it expects to be
  forwarded, and for which hubs these ports will be used. It only lists hubs on
  which you are currently active, so the output will change when you open or
  close a hub connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have multiple network interfaces, you can force ncdc to use only a single
  interface by setting the &quot;local_address&quot; setting to the address of
  that interface. This affects both outgoing connections (they will be forced to
  go through the configured interface) and incoming connections (the ports will
  be bound to the configured interface).
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of the previously mentioned settings can be set globally (with
  &quot;/set&quot;) and on a per-hub basis (with &quot;/hset&quot;). This allows
  you to be active on an internet hub and a LAN-only hub at the same time. It
  also allows you to be active in one hub while passive in another, or to use
  different ports for each hub.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERACTIVE_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERACTIVE_COMMANDS">INTERACTIVE
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
The following is the list of commands that can be used within ncdc. The /help
  command can also be used get a list of available commands and to access this
  documentation.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/accept</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use this command to accept the TLS certificate of a hub.
      This command is used only in the case the keyprint of the TLS certificate
      of a hub does not match the keyprint stored in the database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/browse</b> [[-f] &lt;user&gt;]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Without arguments, this opens a new tab where you can
      browse your own file list. Note that changes to your list are not
      immediately visible in the browser. You need to re-open the tab to get the
      latest version of your list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With arguments, the file list of the specified user will be downloaded (if
      it has not been downloaded already) and the browse tab will open once it's
      complete. The `-f' flag can be used to force the file list to be
      (re-)downloaded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/clear</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clears the log displayed on the screen. Does not affect the
      log files in any way. Ctrl+l is a shortcut for this command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/close</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Close the current tab. When closing a hub tab, you will be
      disconnected from the hub and all related userlist and PM tabs will also
      be closed. Alt+c is a shortcut for this command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/connect</b> [&lt;address&gt;]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Initiate a connection with a hub. If no address is
      specified, will connect to the hub you last used on the current tab. The
      address should be in the form of `protocol://host:port/' or `host:port'.
      The `:port' part is in both cases optional and defaults to :411. The
      following protocols are recognized: dchub, nmdc, nmdcs, adc, adcs. When
      connecting to an nmdcs or adcs hub and the SHA256 keyprint is known, you
      can attach this to the url as `?kp=SHA256/&lt;base32-encoded-keyprint&gt;'
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that this command can only be used on hub tabs. If you want to open a
      new connection to a hub, you need to use /open first. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  /open testhub
  /connect dchub://dc.some-test-hub.com/
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See the /open command for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/connections</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Open the connections tab.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/delhub</b> &lt;name&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Remove a hub from the configuration</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/disconnect</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disconnect from a hub.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/gc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Cleans up unused data and reorganizes existing data to
      allow more efficient storage and usage. Currently, this commands removes
      unused hash data, does a VACUUM on db.sqlite3, removes unused files in
      inc/ and old files in fl/.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This command may take some time to complete, and will fully block ncdc while
      it is running. It is recommended to run this command every once in a
      while. Every month is a good interval. Note that when ncdc says that it
      has completed this command, it's lying to you. Ncdc will still run a few
      large queries on the background, which may take up to a minute to
      complete.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/grant</b> [-list|&lt;user&gt;]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Grant someone a slot. This allows the user to download from
      you even if you have no free slots. The slot will remain granted until the
      /ungrant command is used, even if ncdc has been restarted in the mean
      time.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To get a list of users whom you have granted a slot, use `/grant' without
      arguments or with `-list'. Be warned that using `/grant' without arguments
      on a PM tab will grant the slot to the user you are talking with. Make
      sure to use `-list' in that case.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that a granted slot is specific to a single hub. If the same user is
      also on other hubs, he/she will not be granted a slot on those hubs.</dd>

    [&lt;section&gt;]]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To get a list of available commands, use /help without
      arguments. To get information on a particular command, use /help

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/kick</b> &lt;user&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Kick a user from the hub. This command only works on NMDC
      hubs, and you need to be an OP to be able to use it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>/listen</b></dt>

    <pre>
  ** Nick is doing something
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that this command only works correctly on ADC hubs. The NMDC protocol

      for storing hub-specific configuration.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you have specified an address or have previously connected to a hub from
      a tab with the same name, /open will automatically connect to the hub. Use

  <dd class="It-tag">This command can be used to send a password to the hub
      without saving it to the database. If you wish to login automatically
      without having to type /password every time, use '/hset password

All fields are encoded in UTF-8. Fields that may contain a space or newline are
  escaped as follows: A space is escaped as &quot;\s&quot;, a newline as
  &quot;\n&quot; and a backslash as &quot;\\&quot;. The timestamp is not
  escaped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many clients download files is separate (smallish) chunks. Ncdc makes no attempt
  to combine multiple chunk requests in a single log entry, so you may see the
  same uploaded file several times with a different file offset.
