<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncdc - Ncurses Direct Connect Client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncdc [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ncdc is a modern and lightweight direct connect client with
a friendly ncurses interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
This is a basic introduction for those who are new to ncdc.
See the chapters below for a more detailed description of
the available functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What you see when starting up
ncdc is an input line where you can input commands and a log
window where the results are displayed, much like a regular
terminal. Commands within <br>
ncdc start with a slash (e.g. &quot;/help&quot;) and have
tab completion to help you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first thing you will want to
do after starting ncdc for the first time is to setup some
basic information and settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/set nick MyNick <br>
/set description ncdc is awesome! <br>
/set connection 10 <br>
/share &quot;My Awesome Files&quot; /path/to/files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And if you have a direct
connection to the internet or if your router allows port
forwarding, you may also want to enable active mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/set active_port 34194 <br>
/set active true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the help text for each of
the commands and settings for more information. Of course,
all of the above settings are saved to the database and will
be used again on the next <br>
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To connect to a hub, use
/open:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/open ncdc
adc://dc.blicky.net:2780/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here ncdc is the personal name
you give to the hub, and the second argument the URL. This
URL will be saved in the database, so the next time you want
to connect to this hub, you <br>
can simply do &quot;/open ncdc&quot;. See the help text for
&quot;/open&quot; and &quot;/connect&quot; for more
information. If you want to automatically connect to a hub
when ncdc starts up, use the <br>
&quot;autoconnect&quot; setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ncdc uses a tabbed interface:
every hub opens in a new tab, and there are several other
kinds of tabs available as well. The type of tab is
indicated in the tab list on the <br>
bottom of the screen with a character prefix. Hubs, for
example, are prefixed with a &quot;#&quot;. If a tab needs
your attention, a colored exclamation mark is displayed
before the tab <br>
name, different colors are used for different types of
activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Everything else should be fairly
self-explanatory: To search for files, use the
&quot;/search&quot; command. To browse through the user list
of a hub, use &quot;/userlist&quot; or hit Alt+u. To <br>
browse someone&rsquo;s file list, use &quot;/browse&quot; or
hit the &rsquo;b&rsquo; key in the user list. And to monitor
your upload and download connections, use
&quot;/connections&quot; or hit Alt+n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --session-dir= dir <br>
Use a different session directory. Defaults to the contents
of the environment variable &lsquo;$NCDC_DIR&rsquo; or if
this is unset to &lsquo;$HOME/.ncdc&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-autoconnect <br>
Don&rsquo;t automatically connect to hubs with the
&quot;autoconnect&quot; option set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-bracketed-paste <br>
Disable bracketed pasting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Display ncdc version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING CONNECTED <br>
As with most file sharing clients, ncdc supports two modes
of being connected: active and passive. In passive mode (the
default), you can connect to the outside world but nobody
<br>
can connect (directly) to you. When passive, you will only
be able to transfer files with people who are in active
mode. In active mode, however, you will have some port open
to <br>
the rest of the network to which other clients can connect.
When active, you will be able to transfer files with
everyone and you may get more and faster search results.
<br>
Configuring active mode is therefore recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many setups, all you need to
do to switch to active mode is to set a TCP/UDP port and
enable the &quot;active&quot; setting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/set active_port 34194 <br>
/set active true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you connect to a hub, the
status bar will tell you whether you are active or passive
on that particular hub, and what IP address is being used to
allow others to connect to <br>
you. For most hubs, your IP address will be detected
automatically, but in the event that this fails, you can
also set it yourself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/set active_ip 13.33.33.7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are behind a NAT or
firewall, you have to ensure that the port you configured is
somehow allowed and/or forwarded. The
&quot;active_port&quot; setting is used for incoming TCP
<br>
connections and UDP messages. You can configure a different
UDP port with the &quot;active_udp_port&quot; setting.
Contrary to many toher Direct Connect clients, ncdc only
uses a single <br>
port for incoming TCP and TLS connections; There is no
separate port for TLS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;/listen&quot; command
can tell you which ports it expects to be forwarded, and for
which hubs these ports will be used. It only lists hubs on
which you are currently active, so <br>
the output will change when you open or close a hub
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have multiple network
interfaces, you can force ncdc to use only a single
interface by setting the &quot;local_address&quot; setting
to the address of that interface. This affects <br>
both outgoing connections (they will be forced to go through
the configured interface) and incoming connections (the
ports will be bound to the configured interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the previously mentioned
settings can be set globally (with &quot;/set&quot;) and on
a per-hub basis (with &quot;/hset&quot;). This allows you to
be active on an internet hub and a LAN-only <br>
hub at the same time. It also allows you to be active in one
hub while passive in another, or to use different ports for
each hub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS <br>
The following is the list of commands that can be used
within ncdc. The /help command can also be used get a list
of available commands and to access this documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/accept <br>
Use this command to accept the TLS certificate of a hub.
This command is used only in the case the keyprint of the
TLS certificate of a hub does not match the keyprint stored
<br>
in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/browse [[-f] &lt;user&gt;] <br>
Without arguments, this opens a new tab where you can browse
your own file list. Note that changes to your list are not
immediately visible in the browser. You need to re- <br>
open the tab to get the latest version of your list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With arguments, the file list of
the specified user will be downloaded (if it has not been
downloaded already) and the browse tab will open once
it&rsquo;s complete. The &lsquo;-f&rsquo; flag <br>
can be used to force the file list to be
(re-)downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/clear <br>
Clears the log displayed on the screen. Does not affect the
log files in any way. Ctrl+l is a shortcut for this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/close <br>
Close the current tab. When closing a hub tab, you will be
disconnected from the hub and all related userlist and PM
tabs will also be closed. Alt+c is a shortcut for this <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/connect [&lt;address&gt;] <br>
Initiate a connection with a hub. If no address is
specified, will connect to the hub you last used on the
current tab. The address should be in the form of <br>
&lsquo;protocol://host:port/&rsquo; or
&lsquo;host:port&rsquo;. The &lsquo;:port&rsquo; part is in
both cases optional and defaults to :411. The following
protocols are recognized: dchub, nmdc, nmdcs, adc, <br>
adcs. When connecting to an nmdcs or adcs hub and the SHA256
keyprint is known, you can attach this to the url as
&lsquo;?kp=SHA256/&lt;base32-encoded-keyprint&gt;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this command can only
be used on hub tabs. If you want to open a new connection to
a hub, you need to use /open first. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/open testhub <br>
/connect dchub://dc.some-test-hub.com/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the /open command for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/connections <br>
Open the connections tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/delhub &lt;name&gt; <br>
Remove a hub from the configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/disconnect <br>
Disconnect from a hub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/gc Cleans up unused data and
reorganizes existing data to allow more efficient storage
and usage. Currently, this commands removes unused hash
data, does a VACUUM on db.sqlite3, <br>
removes unused files in inc/ and old files in fl/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command may take some time
to complete, and will fully block ncdc while it is running.
It is recommended to run this command every once in a while.
Every month is a good <br>
interval. Note that when ncdc says that it has completed
this command, it&rsquo;s lying to you. Ncdc will still run a
few large queries on the background, which may take up to a
<br>
minute to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/grant [-list|&lt;user&gt;] <br>
Grant someone a slot. This allows the user to download from
you even if you have no free slots. The slot will remain
granted until the /ungrant command is used, even if ncdc
<br>
has been restarted in the mean time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get a list of users whom you
have granted a slot, use &lsquo;/grant&rsquo; without
arguments or with &lsquo;-list&rsquo;. Be warned that using
&lsquo;/grant&rsquo; without arguments on a PM tab will
grant <br>
the slot to the user you are talking with. Make sure to use
&lsquo;-list&rsquo; in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a granted slot is
specific to a single hub. If the same user is also on other
hubs, he/she will not be granted a slot on those hubs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/help [&lt;command&gt;|set
&lt;key&gt;|keys [&lt;section&gt;]] <br>
To get a list of available commands, use /help without
arguments. To get information on a particular command, use
/help &lt;command&gt;. To get information on a configuration
<br>
setting, use /help set &lt;setting&gt;. To get help on key
bindings, use /help keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/hset [&lt;key&gt;
[&lt;value&gt;]] <br>
Get or set per-hub configuration variables. Works equivalent
to the &lsquo;/set&rsquo; command, but can only be used on
hub tabs. Use &lsquo;/hunset&rsquo; to reset a variable back
to its global <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/hunset [&lt;key&gt;] <br>
This command can be used to reset a per-hub configuration
variable back to its global value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/kick &lt;user&gt; <br>
Kick a user from the hub. This command only works on NMDC
hubs, and you need to be an OP to be able to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/listen <br>
List currently opened ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/me &lt;message&gt; <br>
This allows you to talk in third person. Most clients will
display your message as something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">** Nick is doing something</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this command only
works correctly on ADC hubs. The NMDC protocol does not have
this feature, and your message will be sent as-is, including
the /me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/msg &lt;user&gt;
[&lt;message&gt;] <br>
Send a private message to a user on the currently opened
hub. If no message is given, the tab will be opened but no
message will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/nick [&lt;nick&gt;] <br>
Alias for &lsquo;/hset nick&rsquo; on hub tabs, and
&lsquo;/set nick&rsquo; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/open [-n] [&lt;name&gt;]
[&lt;address&gt;] <br>
Without arguments, list all hubs known by the current
configuration. Otherwise, this opens a new tab to use for a
hub. The name is a (short) personal name you use to <br>
identify the hub, and will be used for storing hub-specific
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have specified an address
or have previously connected to a hub from a tab with the
same name, /open will automatically connect to the hub. Use
the &lsquo;-n&rsquo; flag to <br>
disable this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See /connect for more
information on connecting to a hub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/password &lt;password&gt; <br>
This command can be used to send a password to the hub
without saving it to the database. If you wish to login
automatically without having to type /password every time,
use <br>
&rsquo;/hset password &lt;password&gt;&rsquo;. Be warned,
however, that your password will be saved unencrypted in
that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/pm &lt;user&gt;
[&lt;message&gt;] <br>
Alias for /msg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/queue <br>
Open the download queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/quit <br>
Quit ncdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/reconnect <br>
Reconnect to the hub. When your nick or the hub encoding
have been changed, the new settings will be used after the
reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command can also be used on
the main tab, in which case all connected hubs will be
reconnected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/refresh [&lt;path&gt;] <br>
Initiates share refresh. If no argument is given, the
complete list will be refreshed. Otherwise only the
specified directory will be refreshed. The path argument can
be <br>
either an absolute filesystem path or a virtual path within
your share.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/say &lt;message&gt; <br>
Sends a chat message to the current hub or user. You
normally don&rsquo;t have to use the /say command
explicitly, any command not staring with &rsquo;/&rsquo;
will automatically imply &lsquo;/say <br>
&lt;command&gt;&rsquo;. For example, typing
&lsquo;hello.&rsquo; in the command line is equivalent to
&lsquo;/say hello.&rsquo;. Using the /say command explicitly
may be useful to send message starting with &rsquo;/&rsquo;
<br>
to the chat, for example &lsquo;/say /help is what you are
looking for&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/search [options] &lt;query&gt;
<br>
Performs a file search, opening a new tab with the
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hub Search the current hub
only. (default) <br>
-all Search all connected hubs, except those with
&lsquo;chat_only&rsquo; set. <br>
-le &lt;s&gt; Size of the file must be less than &lt;s&gt;.
<br>
-ge &lt;s&gt; Size of the file must be larger than
&lt;s&gt;. <br>
-t &lt;t&gt; File must be of type &lt;t&gt;. (see below)
<br>
-tth &lt;h&gt; TTH root of this file must match
&lt;h&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File sizes (&lt;s&gt; above)
accept the following suffixes: G (GiB), M (MiB) and K
(KiB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following file types can be
used with the -t option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 any Any file or directory.
(default) <br>
2 audio Audio files. <br>
3 archive (Compressed) archives. <br>
4 doc Text documents. <br>
5 exe Windows executables. <br>
6 img Image files. <br>
7 video Video files. <br>
8 dir Directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that file type matching is
done using file extensions, and is not very reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/set [&lt;key&gt;
[&lt;value&gt;]] <br>
Get or set global configuration variables. Use without
arguments to get a list of all global settings and their
current value. Glob-style pattern matching on the settings
is <br>
also possible. Use, for example, &lsquo;/set color*&rsquo;
to list all color-related settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the &lsquo;/unset&rsquo;
command to change a setting back to its default, and the
&lsquo;/hset&rsquo; command to manage configuration on a
per-hub basis. Changes to the settings are <br>
automatically saved to the database, and will not be lost
after restarting ncdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get information on a
particular setting, use &lsquo;/help set
&lt;key&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/share [&lt;name&gt;
&lt;path&gt;] <br>
Use /share without arguments to get a list of shared
directories. When called with a name and a path, the path
will be added to your share. Note that shell escaping may be
<br>
used in the name. For example, to add a directory with the
name &lsquo;Fun Stuff&rsquo;, you could do the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/share &quot;Fun Stuff&quot;
/path/to/fun/stuff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/share Fun&nbsp;Stuff
/path/to/fun/stuff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full path to the directory
will not be visible to others, only the name you give it
will be public. An initial &lsquo;/refresh&rsquo; is done
automatically on the added directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ungrant [&lt;user&gt;] <br>
Revoke a granted slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/unset [&lt;key&gt;] <br>
This command can be used to reset a global configuration
variable back to its default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/unshare [&lt;name&gt;] <br>
To remove a single directory from your share, use
&lsquo;/unshare &lt;name&gt;&rsquo;, to remove all
directories from your share, use &lsquo;/unshare
/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the hash data
associated with the removed files will remain in the
database. This allows you to re-add the files to your share
without needing to re-hash them. The <br>
downside is that the database file may grow fairly large
with unneeded information. See the &lsquo;/gc&rsquo; command
to clean that up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/userlist <br>
Opens the user list of the currently selected hub. Can also
be accessed using Alt+u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/whois &lt;user&gt; <br>
This will open the user list and select the given user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTINGS <br>
The following is a list of configuration settings. These
settings can be changed and queried using the
&quot;/set&quot; command for global settings and
&quot;/hset&quot; for hub-local settings. All <br>
configuration data is stored in the db.sqlite3 file in the
session directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Enables or disables active mode. You may have to configure
your router and/or firewall for this to work, see the
&lsquo;active_ip&rsquo; and &lsquo;active_port&rsquo;
settings for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active_ip &lt;string&gt; <br>
Your public IP address for use in active mode. If this is
not set or set to &rsquo;0.0.0.0&rsquo; for IPv4 or
&rsquo;::&rsquo; for IPv6, then ncdc will try to
automatically get your IP address from <br>
the hub. If you do set this manually, it is important that
other clients can reach you using this IP address. If you
connect to a hub on the internet, this should be your <br>
internet (WAN) IP. Likewise, if you connect to a hub on your
LAN, this should be your LAN IP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address
are set by providing two IP addresses separated with a
comma. When unset, &rsquo;0.0.0.0,::&rsquo; is assumed. Only
the IP version used to connect to the <br>
hub is used. That is, if you connect to an IPv6 hub, then
the configured IPv6 address is used and the IPv4 address is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When set to the special value
&lsquo;local&rsquo;, ncdc will automatically get your IP
address from the local network interface that is used to
connect to the hub. This option should <br>
only be used if there is no NAT between you and the hub,
because this will give the wrong IP if you are behind a
NAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active_port &lt;integer&gt; <br>
The listen port for incoming connections in active mode. Set
to &lsquo;0&rsquo; to automatically assign a random port.
This setting is by default also used for the UDP port, see
the <br>
&lsquo;active_tls_port&rsquo; settings to change that. If
you are behind a router or firewall, make sure that you have
configured it to forward and allow these ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">active_udp_port &lt;integer&gt;
<br>
The listen port for incoming UDP connections in active mode.
Defaults to the &lsquo;active_port&rsquo; setting, or to a
random number if &lsquo;active_port&rsquo; is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adc_blom &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether to support the BLOM extension on ADC hubs. This may
decrease the bandwidth usage on the hub connection, in
exchange for a bit of computational overhead. Some hubs <br>
require this setting to be enabled. This setting requires a
reconnect with the hub to be active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoconnect &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Set to true to automatically connect to the current hub when
ncdc starts up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autorefresh &lt;interval&gt;
<br>
The time between automatic file refreshes. Recognized
suffices are &rsquo;s&rsquo; for seconds, &rsquo;m&rsquo;
for minutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for hours and &rsquo;d&rsquo;
for days. Set to 0 to disable automatically <br>
refreshing the file list. This setting also determines
whether ncdc will perform a refresh on startup. See the
&lsquo;/refresh&rsquo; command to manually refresh your file
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backlog &lt;integer&gt; <br>
When opening a hub or PM tab, ncdc can load a certain amount
of lines from the log file into the log window. Setting this
to a positive value enables this feature and <br>
configures the number of lines to load. Note that, while
this setting can be set on a per-hub basis, PM windows will
use the global value (global.backlog).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chat_only &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Set to true to indicate that this hub is only used for
chatting. That is, you won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t download
from it. This setting affects the /search command when it is
given the <br>
-all option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color_* &lt;color&gt; <br>
The settings starting with the &lsquo;color_&rsquo; prefix
allow you to change the interface colors. The following is a
list of available color settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_default - default item in a
list <br>
list_header - header of a list <br>
list_select - selected item in a list <br>
log_default - default log color <br>
log_time - the time prefix in log messages <br>
log_nick - default nick color <br>
log_highlight - nick color of a highlighted line <br>
log_ownnick - color of your own nick <br>
log_join - color of join messages <br>
log_quit - color of quit messages <br>
separator - the list separator/footer bar <br>
tab_active - the active tab in the tab list <br>
tabprio_low - low priority tab notification color <br>
tabprio_med - medium priority tab notification color <br>
tabprio_high - high priority tab notification color <br>
title - the title bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual color value can be
set with a comma-separated list of color names and/or
attributes. The first color in the list is the foreground
color, the second color is used <br>
for the background. When the fore- or background color is
not specified, the default colors of your terminal will be
used. The following color names can be used: black, <br>
blue, cyan, default, green, magenta, red, white and yellow.
The following attributes can be used: bold, blink, reverse
and underline. The actual color values displayed by <br>
your terminal may vary. Adding the &lsquo;bold&rsquo;
attribute usually makes the foreground color appear brighter
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connection &lt;string&gt; <br>
Set your upload speed. This is just an indication for other
users in the hub so that they know what speed they can
expect when downloading from you. The actual format you can
<br>
use here may vary, but it is recommended to set it to either
a plain number for Mbit/s (e.g. &lsquo;50&rsquo; for 50
mbit) or a number with a &lsquo;KiB/s&rsquo; indicator (e.g.
&lsquo;2300 KiB/s&rsquo;). On <br>
ADC hubs you must use one of the previously mentioned
formats, otherwise no upload speed will be broadcasted. This
setting is broadcasted as-is on NMDC hubs, to allow for <br>
using old-style connection values (e.g. &lsquo;DSL&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Cable&rsquo;) on hubs that require this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting is ignored if
&lsquo;upload_rate&rsquo; has been set. If it is, that value
is broadcasted instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">description &lt;string&gt; <br>
A short public description that will be displayed in the
user list of a hub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect_offline
&lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Automatically disconnect any upload or download transfers
when a user leaves the hub, or when you leave the hub.
Setting this to &lsquo;true&rsquo; ensures that you are only
connected <br>
with people who are online on the same hubs as you are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download_dir &lt;path&gt; <br>
The directory where finished downloads are moved to.
Finished downloads are by default stored in &lt;session
directory&gt;/dl/. It is possible to set this to a location
that is on <br>
a different filesystem than the incoming directory, but
doing so is not recommended: ncdc will block when moving the
completed files to their final destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download_exclude &lt;regex&gt;
<br>
When recursively adding a directory to the download queue -
by pressing &lsquo;d&rsquo; on a directory in the file list
browser - any item in the selected directory with a name
that <br>
matches this regular expression will not be added to the
download queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This regex is not checked when
adding individual files from either the file list browser or
the search results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download_rate &lt;speed&gt; <br>
Maximum combined transfer rate of all downloads. The total
download speed will be limited to this value. The suffixes
&lsquo;G&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;, and &rsquo;K&rsquo; can be
used for GiB/s, MiB/s and <br>
KiB/s, respectively. Note that, similar to upload_rate, TCP
overhead are not counted towards this limit, so the actual
bandwidth usage might be a little higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download_segment &lt;size&gt;
<br>
Minimum segment size to use when requesting file data from
another user. Set to 0 to disable segmented downloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download_slots &lt;integer&gt;
<br>
Maximum number of simultaneous downloads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">email &lt;string&gt; <br>
Your email address. This will be displayed in the user list
of the hub, so only set this if you want it to be
public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding &lt;string&gt; <br>
The character set/encoding to use for hub and PM messages.
This setting is only used on NMDC hubs, ADC always uses
UTF-8. Some common values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CP1250 (Central Europe) <br>
CP1251 (Cyrillic) <br>
CP1252 (Western Europe) <br>
ISO-8859-7 (Greek) <br>
KOI8-R (Cyrillic) <br>
UTF-8 (International)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filelist_maxage &lt;interval&gt;
<br>
The maximum age of a downloaded file list. If a file list
was downloaded longer ago than the configured interval, it
will be removed from the cache (the fl/ directory) and <br>
subsequent requests to open the file list will result in the
list being downloaded from the user again. Recognized
suffices are &rsquo;s&rsquo; for seconds, &rsquo;m&rsquo;
for minutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for <br>
hours and &rsquo;d&rsquo; for days. Set to 0 to disable the
cache altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush_file_cache
&lt;none|upload|download|hash&gt;[,...] <br>
Tell the OS to flush the file (disk) cache for file contents
read while hashing and/or uploading or written to while
downloading. On one hand, this will avoid trashing your <br>
disk cache with large files and thus improve the overall
responsiveness of your system. On the other hand, ncdc may
purge any shared files from the cache, even if they are <br>
still used by other applications. In general, it is a good
idea to enable this if you also use your system for other
things besides ncdc, you share large files (&gt;100MB) and
<br>
people are not constantly downloading the same file from
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geoip_cc4 &lt;path&gt;|disabled
<br>
Path to the GeoIP Country database file for IPv4, or
&rsquo;disabled&rsquo; to disable GeoIP lookup for IPv4
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geoip_cc6 &lt;path&gt;|disabled
<br>
Path to the GeoIP Country database file for IPv6, or
&rsquo;disabled&rsquo; to disable GeoIP lookup for IPv6
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_rate &lt;speed&gt; <br>
Maximum file hashing speed. See the
&lsquo;download_rate&rsquo; setting for allowed formats for
this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hubname &lt;string&gt; <br>
The name of the currently opened hub tab. This is a
user-assigned name, and is only used within ncdc itself.
This is the same name as given to the &lsquo;/open&rsquo;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">incoming_dir &lt;path&gt; <br>
The directory where incomplete downloads are stored. This
setting can only be changed when the download queue is
empty. Also see the download_dir setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_address &lt;string&gt;
<br>
Specifies the address of the local network interface to use
for connecting to the outside and for accepting incoming
connections in active mode. Both an IPv4 and an IPv6 <br>
address are set by providing two IP addresses separated with
a comma. When unset, &rsquo;0.0.0.0,::&rsquo; is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no IPv4 address is specified,
&rsquo;0.0.0.0&rsquo; is added automatically. Similarly, if
no IPv6 address is specified, &rsquo;::&rsquo; is added
automatically. The address that is actually used <br>
depends on the IP version actually used. That is, if
you&rsquo;re on an IPv6 hub, then ncdc will listen on the
specified IPv6 address. Note that, even if the hub
you&rsquo;re on is on <br>
IPv6, ncdc may still try to connect to another client over
IPv4, at which point the socket will be bound to the
configured IPv4 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_debug &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Log debug messages to stderr.log in the session directory.
It is highly recommended to enable this setting if you wish
to debug or hack ncdc. Be warned, however, that this <br>
may generate a lot of data if you&rsquo;re connected to a
large hub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_downloads &lt;boolean&gt;
<br>
Log downloaded files to transfers.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_hubchat &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Log the main hub chat. Note that changing this requires any
affected hub tabs to be closed and reopened before the
change is effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_uploads &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Log file uploads to transfers.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minislots &lt;integer&gt; <br>
Set the number of available minislots. A
&lsquo;minislot&rsquo; is a special slot that is used when
all regular upload slots are in use and someone is
requesting your filelist or a small <br>
file. In this case, the other client automatically applies
for a minislot, and can still download from you as long as
not all minislots are in use. What constitutes a
&lsquo;small&rsquo; <br>
file can be changed with the &lsquo;minislot_size&rsquo;
setting. Also see the &lsquo;slots&rsquo; configuration
setting and the &lsquo;/grant&rsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minislot_size &lt;integer&gt;
<br>
The maximum size of a file that may be downloaded using a
&lsquo;minislot&rsquo;, in KiB. See the
&lsquo;minislots&rsquo; setting for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nick &lt;string&gt; <br>
Your nick. Nick changes are only visible on newly connected
hubs, use the &lsquo;/reconnect&rsquo; command to use your
new nick immediately. Note that it is highly discouraged to
change <br>
your nick on NMDC hubs. This is because clients downloading
from you have no way of knowing that you changed your nick,
and therefore can&rsquo;t immediately continue to download
<br>
from you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify_bell
&lt;disable|low|medium|high&gt; <br>
When enabled, ncdc will send a bell to your terminal when a
tab indicates a notification. The notification types
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">high - Messages directed to you
(PM or highlight in hub chat), <br>
medium - Regular hub chat, <br>
low - User joins/quits, new search results, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How a &quot;bell&quot; (or
&quot;beep&quot; or &quot;alert&quot;, whatever you prefer
to call it) manifests itself depends on your terminal. In
some setups, this generates an audible system bell. In other
<br>
setups it can makes your terminal window flash or do other
annoying things to get your attention. And in some setups it
is ignored completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password &lt;string&gt; <br>
Sets your password for the current hub and enables
auto-login on connect. If you just want to login to a hub
without saving your password, use the
&lsquo;/password&rsquo; command <br>
instead. Passwords are saved unencrypted in the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reconnect_timeout
&lt;interval&gt; <br>
The time to wait before automatically reconnecting to a hub.
Set to 0 to disable automatic reconnect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendfile &lt;boolean&gt; <br>
Whether or not to use the sendfile() system call to upload
files, if supported. Using sendfile() allows less resource
usage while uploading, but may not work well on all <br>
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">share_emptydirs &lt;boolean&gt;
<br>
Share empty directories. When disabled (the default), empty
directories in your share will not be visible to others.
This also affects empty directories containing only empty
<br>
directories, etc. A file list refresh is required for this
setting to be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">share_exclude &lt;regex&gt; <br>
Any file or directory with a name that matches this regular
expression will not be shared. A file list refresh is
required for this setting to be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">share_hidden &lt;boolean&gt;
<br>
Whether to share hidden files and directories. A
&lsquo;hidden&rsquo; file or directory is one of which the
file name starts with a dot. (e.g. &lsquo;.bashrc&rsquo;). A
file list refresh is required <br>
for this setting to be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">share_symlinks &lt;boolean&gt;
<br>
Whether to follow symlinks in shared directories. When
disabled (default), ncdc will never share any files outside
of the directory you specified. When enabled, any symlinks
<br>
in your shared directories will be followed, even when they
point to a directory outside your share.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show_joinquit &lt;boolean&gt;
<br>
Whether to display join/quit messages in the hub chat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slots &lt;integer&gt; <br>
The number of upload slots. This determines for the most
part how many people can download from you simultaneously.
It is possible that this limit is exceeded in certain <br>
circumstances, see the &lsquo;minislots&rsquo; setting and
the &lsquo;/grant&rsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sudp_policy
&lt;disabled|allow|prefer&gt; <br>
Set the policy for sending or receiving encrypted UDP search
results. When set to &lsquo;disabled&rsquo;, all UDP search
results will be sent and received in plain text. Set this to
<br>
&lsquo;allow&rsquo; to let ncdc reply with encrypted search
results if the other client requested it.
&lsquo;prefer&rsquo; will also cause ncdc itself to request
encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, regardless of this
setting, encrypted UDP search results are only used on ADCS
hubs. They will never be sent on NMDC or non-TLS ADC hubs.
Also note that, even if <br>
you set this to &lsquo;prefer&rsquo;, encryption is still
only used when the client on the other side of the
connection also supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tls_policy
&lt;disabled|allow|prefer&gt; <br>
Set the policy for secure client-to-client connections.
Setting this to &lsquo;disabled&rsquo; disables TLS support
for client connections, but still allows you to connect to
TLS-enabled <br>
hubs. &lsquo;allow&rsquo; will allow the use of TLS if the
other client requests this, but ncdc itself will not request
TLS when connecting to others. Setting this to
&lsquo;prefer&rsquo; tells ncdc <br>
to also request TLS when connecting to others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of TLS for client
connections usually results in less optimal performance when
uploading and downloading, but is quite effective at
avoiding protocol-specific traffic <br>
shaping that some ISPs may do. Also note that, even if you
set this to &lsquo;prefer&rsquo;, TLS will only be used if
the connecting party also supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tls_priority &lt;string&gt; <br>
Set the GnuTLS priority string used for all TLS-enabled
connections. See the &quot;Priority strings&quot; section in
the GnuTLS manual for details on what this does and how it
works. <br>
Currently it is not possible to set a different priority
string for different types of connections (e.g. hub or
incoming/outgoing client connections).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ui_time_format &lt;string&gt;
<br>
The format of the time displayed in the lower-left of the
screen. Set &lsquo;-&rsquo; to not display a time at all.
The string is passed to the Glib g_date_time_format()
function, which <br>
accepts roughly the same formats as strftime(). Check out
the strftime(3) man page or the Glib documentation for more
information. Note that this setting does not influence <br>
the date/time format used in other places, such as the chat
window or log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload_rate &lt;speed&gt; <br>
Maximum combined transfer rate of all uploads. See the
&lsquo;download_rate&rsquo; setting for more information on
rate limiting. Note that this setting also overrides any
&lsquo;connection&rsquo; <br>
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
On any tab without the text input line, you can press
&lsquo;?&rsquo; to get the key bindings for that tab. The
list of key bindings is available through the &quot;/help
keys&quot; command, and is <br>
reproduced below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
$NCDC_DIR is used to determine the session dir, it is only
honoured if -c is not set on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$NCDC_DIR corresponds to the session dir set via -c,
environment variable $NCDC_DIR or $HOME/.ncdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/cert/ <br>
Directory where the client certificates are stored. Must
contain a private key file (client.key) and public
certificate (client.crt). These will be generated
automatically <br>
when ncdc starts up the first time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/db.sqlite3 <br>
The database. This stores all configuration variables, hash
data of shared files, download queue information and other
state information. Manually editing this file with the <br>
&lsquo;sqlite3&rsquo; commandline tool is possible but
discouraged. Any changes made to the database while ncdc is
running will not be read, and may even get overwritten by
ncdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/dl/ <br>
Directory where completed downloads are moved to by default.
Can be changed with the &quot;download_dir&quot;
configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/files.xml.bz2 <br>
Filelist containing a listing of all shared files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/fl/ <br>
Directory where downloaded file lists from other users are
stored. The names of the files are hex-encoded user IDs that
are used internally by ncdc. Old file lists are <br>
deleted automatically after a configurable interval. See the
&quot;filelist_maxage&quot; configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/history <br>
Command history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/inc/ <br>
Default location for incomplete downloads. Can be changed
with the &quot;incoming_dir&quot; setting. The file names in
this directory are the base32-encoded TTH root of the
completed <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/logs/ <br>
Directory where all the log files are stored. File names
starting with &lsquo;#&rsquo; are hub logs and
&lsquo;~&rsquo; are user (PM) logs. Special log files are
transfers.log and main.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdc does not have built-in
functionality to rotate or compress log files automatically.
When rotating log files manually (e.g. via a cron job), make
sure to send the SIGUSR1 <br>
signal afterwards to force ncdc to flush the old logs and
create or open the new log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/stderr.log <br>
Error/debug log. This file is cleared every time ncdc starts
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NCDC_DIR/version <br>
Version of the data directory. This file locked while an
ncdc instance is running, making sure that no two ncdc
instances work with the same session directory at the same
<br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format of transfers.log <br>
Uploads and downloads are logged in the transfers.log file.
Transfers are separated by a newline (0x0a). Each log line
has the following fields, separated by a space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Date/time when the transfer
ended, formatted as &quot;[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. User name (escaped),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. IPv4 or IPv6 address,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Direction, &quot;u&quot; for
upload or &quot;d&quot; for download,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Whether the transfer
completed successfully (&quot;c&quot;) or has been
interrupted/disconnected before all requested file data has
been transferred (&quot;i&quot;),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Base32-encoded TTH of the
transferred file, or &rsquo;-&rsquo; for
&quot;files.xml.bz2&quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Total transfer time, in
