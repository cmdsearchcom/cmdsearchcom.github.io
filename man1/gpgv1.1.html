<p>GPGV(1) GNU Privacy Guard 1.4 GPGV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpgv - Verify OpenPGP signatures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpgv [options] signed_files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is actually a
stripped-down version of gpg which is only able to check
signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
and uses a different (and simpler) <br>
way to check that the public keys used to make the signature
are valid. There are no configuration files and only a few
options are implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpgv assumes that all keys in
the keyring are trustworthy. That does also mean that it
does not check for expired or revoked keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default a keyring named
&acirc;trustedkeys.gpg&acirc; is used. This default keyring
is assumed to be in the home directory of GnuPG, either the
default home directory or the one set by <br>
an option or an environment variable. The option --keyring
may be used to specify a different keyring or even multiple
keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
The program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least
one signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
gpgv recognizes these options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
-v Gives more information during processing. If used twice,
the input data is listed in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
-q Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyring file <br>
Add file to the list of keyrings. If file begins with a
tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the HOME directory.
If the filename does not contain a slash, it is <br>
assumed to be in the home-directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if
--homedir is not used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status-fd n <br>
Write special status strings to the file descriptor n. See
the file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logger-fd n <br>
Write log output to file descriptor n and not to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-time-conflict <br>
GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with
keys and signatures have plausible values. However,
sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to
<br>
clock problems. This option turns these checks into
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--homedir dir <br>
Set the name of the home directory to dir. If this option is
not used, the home directory defaults to
&acirc;~/.gnupg&acirc;. It is only recognized when given on
the command line. <br>
It also overrides any home directory stated through the
environment variable &acirc;GNUPGHOME&acirc; or (on Windows
systems) by means of the Registry entry HKCUt&acirc; <br>
wareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows systems it is
possible to install GnuPG as a portable application. In this
case only this command line option is considered, all other
ways to set a home <br>
directory are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To install GnuPG as a portable
application under Windows, create an empty file name
&acirc;gpgconf.ctl&acirc; in the same directory as the tool
&acirc;gpgconf.exe&acirc;. The root of the instal&acirc;
<br>
lation is than that directory; or, if
&acirc;gpgconf.exe&acirc; has been installed directly below
a directory named &acirc;bin&acirc;, its parent directory.
You also need to make sure that the <br>
following directories exist and are writable:
&acirc;ROOT/home&acirc; for the GnuPG home and
&acirc;ROOT/var/cache/gnupg&acirc; for internal cache
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--weak-digest name <br>
Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak. Signatures
made over weak digests algorithms are normally rejected.
This option can be supplied multiple times if multiple <br>
algorithms should be considered weak. MD5 is always
considered weak, and does not need to be listed
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
gpgv pgpfile <br>
gpgv sigfile [datafile] <br>
Verify the signature of the file. The second form is used
for detached signatures, where sigfile is the detached
signature (either ASCII-armored or binary) and datafile <br>
contains the signed data; if datafile is &quot;-&quot; the
signed data is expected on stdin; if datafile is not given
the name of the file holding the signed data is constructed
by <br>
cutting off the extension (&quot;.asc&quot;,
&quot;.sig&quot; or &quot;.sign&quot;) from sigfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg <br>
The default keyring with the allowed keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME Used to locate the default home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUPGHOME <br>
If set directory used instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for this
tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the
info program are properly installed at your site, the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info gnupg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual including a menu structure and an index.</p>
