<p>MACE4(1) General Commands Manual MACE4(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mace4 - searches for finite countermodels of first-order
statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mace4 [options] &lt; input-file &gt; output-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the mace4 command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program mace4 searches for
finite structures satisfying first-order and equational
statements, the same kind of statement that prover9(1)
accepts. If the statement is the <br>
denial of some conjecture, any structures found by mace4 are
counterexamples to the conjecture. mace4 can be a valuable
complement to prover9(1), looking for counterexamples <br>
before (or at the same time as) using prover9(1) to search
for a proof. It can also be used to help debug input clauses
and formulas for prover9(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of options is included below. Options override the
equivalent settings given in the input file. To set or clear
a flag, you must give 1 or 0 as the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help This tells mace4 to print
a summary of these command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n n This gives the starting
domain size for the search. The default value is 2. If you
also give an -N option, mace4 will iterate domain sizes up
through the -N value, using <br>
an increment given by the -I value. Otherwise, mace4 will
search only for the -n value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N n This gives the ending
domain size for the search. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i n This gives the domain size
increment for the search. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q n This flag overrides the
parameter iterate. It says to try the sizes that are prime
numbers, from -n up through -N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m n Stop searching when the nth
structure has been found. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t n Stop searching after n
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s n Allow at most n seconds for
each domain size. The parameter can be used (together with
-t) to give an overall time limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b n Stop searching when (about)
n megabytes of memory have been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V n A rule is needed for
distinguishing variables from constants in clauses and
formulas with free variables. If this flag is clear,
variables start with (lower case) &lsquo;u&rsquo; <br>
through &lsquo;z&rsquo;. If this flag is set, variables in
clauses start with (upper case) &lsquo;A&rsquo; through
&lsquo;Z&rsquo; or &lsquo;_&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P n If this flag is set, all
structures that are found are printed in
&lsquo;standard&rsquo; form, which means they are suitable
as input to other LADR programs such as isofilter(1) and
<br>
interpformat(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p n If this flag is set, and if
-P is clear, all structures that are found are printed in a
tabular form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R n If this flag is set, a ring
structure is is applied to the search. The operations
{+,-,*} are assumed to be the ring of integers (mod
domain_size). This method puts a <br>
tight constraint on the search, allowing much larger
structures to be investigated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v n If this flag is set, the
output file receives information about the search, including
the initial partial model (the part of the model that can be
determined before back&acirc; <br>
tracking starts) and timing and other statistics for each
domain size. (It does not give a trace of the backtracking,
so it does not consume a lot of file space.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T n If the trace flag is set,
detailed information about the search, including a trace of
all assignments and backtracking, is printed to the standard
output. This flag causes <br>
a lot of output, so it should be used only on small
searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There also exist a number of
advanced options, which are used for experimentation with
search methods. They can be ignored by nearly all users. For
descriptions of these options, <br>
see the original mace4 manual.</p>
