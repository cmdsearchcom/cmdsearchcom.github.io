<p>DH_MAKESHLIBS(1) Debhelper DH_MAKESHLIBS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_makeshlibs - automatically create shlibs file and call
dpkg-gensymbols</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_makeshlibs [debhelper&Acirc;&nbsp;options] [-mmajor]
[-V[dependencies]] [-n] [-Xitem] [--&Acirc;&nbsp;params]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_makeshlibs is a debhelper program that automatically
scans for shared libraries, and generates a shlibs file for
the libraries it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will also ensure that
ldconfig is invoked during install and removal when it finds
shared libraries. Since debhelper 9.20151004, this is done
via a dpkg trigger. In older <br>
versions of debhelper, dh_makeshlibs would generate a
maintainer script for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/package.shlibs <br>
Installs this file, if present, into the package as
DEBIAN/shlibs. If omitted, debhelper will generate a shlibs
file automatically if it detects any libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note in compat levels 9 and
earlier, this file was installed by dh_installdeb(1) rather
than dh_makeshlibs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/package.symbols <br>
debian/package.symbols.arch <br>
These symbols files, if present, are passed to
dpkg-gensymbols(1) to be processed and installed. Use the
arch specific names if you need to provide different symbols
files <br>
for different architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-mmajor, --major=major <br>
Instead of trying to guess the major number of the library
with objdump, use the major number specified after the -m
parameter. This is much less useful than it used to be, <br>
back in the bad old days when this program looked at library
filenames rather than using objdump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, -Vdependencies <br>
--version-info, --version-info=dependencies <br>
By default, the shlibs file generated by this program does
not make packages depend on any particular version of the
package containing the shared library. It may be <br>
necessary for you to add some version dependency information
to the shlibs file. If -V is specified with no dependency
information, the current upstream version of the <br>
package is plugged into a dependency that looks like
&quot;packagename (&gt;= packageversion)&quot;. Note that in
debhelper compatibility levels before v4, the Debian part of
the package <br>
version number is also included. If -V is specified with
parameters, the parameters can be used to specify the exact
dependency information needed (be sure to include the <br>
package name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware of using -V without any
parameters; this is a conservative setting that always
ensures that other packages&rsquo; shared library
dependencies are at least as tight as they <br>
need to be (unless your library is prone to changing ABI
without updating the upstream version number), so that if
the maintainer screws up then they won&rsquo;t break. The
flip <br>
side is that packages might end up with dependencies that
are too tight and so find it harder to be upgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-scripts <br>
Do not add the &quot;ldconfig&quot; trigger even if it seems
like the package might need it. The option is called
--no-scripts for historical reasons as dh_makeshlibs would
previously <br>
generate maintainer scripts that called ldconfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xitem, --exclude=item <br>
Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
or directory from being treated as shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-udeb=udeb <br>
Create an additional line for udebs in the shlibs file and
use udeb as the package name for udebs to depend on instead
of the regular library package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- params <br>
Pass params to dpkg-gensymbols(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
dh_makeshlibs <br>
Assuming this is a package named libfoobar1, generates a
shlibs file that looks something like: <br>
libfoobar 1 libfoobar1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dh_makeshlibs -V <br>
Assuming the current version of the package is 1.1-3,
generates a shlibs file that looks something like: <br>
libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (&gt;= 1.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dh_makeshlibs -V
&rsquo;libfoobar1 (&gt;= 1.0)&rsquo; <br>
Generates a shlibs file that looks something like: <br>
libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (&gt;= 1.0)</p>
