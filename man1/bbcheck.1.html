<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bbcheck - run automated tests on BitBabbler hardware RNG
devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bbcheck [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The bbcheck utility is is tool for quickly and simply
analysing the output of a BitBabbler RNG at various
bitrates. It can run tests on multiple devices in parallel,
and high&acirc; <br>
light the best and worst results from a series of tests on
each device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --scan <br>
Scan the system for available BitBabbler devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --device-id=id <br>
Select a BitBabbler device to analyse by its unique ID. If
no devices are explicitly specified then the default is to
use all of them which are present when testing <br>
begins. This option may be passed multiple times to test
multiple devices. The id may be the device serial number, or
its logical address in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[busnum:]devnum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or on systems where knowing the
USB topology is supported, its physical address in the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">busnum-port[.port ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a logical address the busnum
part is optional, but if devnum is not unique across all
buses, then exactly which device will be selected if it is
not fully specified <br>
becomes a matter of chance. All of the available IDs which
can be used to refer to a device will be reported by the
--scan option. Bus, device, and port numbers are <br>
expected to be decimal integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since bbcheck only operates on
available devices and does not wait for a device to be
hotplugged, it is an error to specify an ID which does not
refer to a device cur&acirc; <br>
rently available in the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --bitrate=min[:max] <br>
Select the bitrate, or range of bitrates, to analyse (in
bits per second). The available bitrates are determined by
an integer clock divider, so not every rate is exactly <br>
achievable. An unsupported rate will be rounded up to the
next higher rate. For convenience the rate may be followed
by an SI multiplier (eg. 2.5M for 2500000). If a <br>
colon separated range is specified, then all possible
bitrates between min and max will be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bytes=n <br>
The number of bytes to analyse for each test. A suffix of
&rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;, or &rsquo;G&rsquo; will
multiply n by the respective power of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --block-size=bytes <br>
The block size used for folding. This size must be a
multiple of 2^n, where n is the level of folding used (ie.
it must be able to fold the desired number of times
with&acirc; <br>
out any remainder). A suffix of &rsquo;k&rsquo;,
&rsquo;M&rsquo;, or &rsquo;G&rsquo; will scale bytes by the
respective power of two. Default is 64kB. A larger block
size will mix samples taken over a <br>
longer timescale. At high bitrates this will mean more of
the lower frequency noise can be factored into each sample
where otherwise the higher frequency noise would dom&acirc;
<br>
inate. The optimum block size (beyond which any change to
the result is negligible) for any given bitrate is still a
matter that is ripe for further study. See the <br>
--fold option below for a more detailed description of
folding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --all-results <br>
Show all the test results, not just the final summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-colour <br>
Don&rsquo;t colour the final results. By default the four
best results will be highlighted bright-green, dull-green,
yellow, and orange, while the worst result will be
high&acirc; <br>
lighted in red. This option suppresses the output of
terminal escape codes which are responsible for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Make more noise about what is going on internally. If used
(once) with the --scan option this will show more
information about each device, but otherwise it&rsquo;s
mostly only <br>
information useful for debugging. It may be passed multiple
times to get swamped with even more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show a shorter version of all of this, which may fit on a
single page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Report the bbcheck release version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per device options <br>
The following options may be used multiple times to
individually configure each device when more than one
BitBabbler is available. If passed before any --device-id
option, then <br>
they set new default values which will apply to every
device. If passed after one of those options they will only
be applied to the immediately preceding device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--latency=ms <br>
Override the calculated value for the USB latency timer.
This controls the maximum amount of time that the device
will wait if there is any data in its internal buffer <br>
(but less than a full packet), before sending it to the
host. If this timer expires before a packet can be filled,
then a short packet will be sent to the host. The <br>
default value is chosen to ensure that we do not send more
short packets than necessary for the selected bitrate, since
that will increase the number of packets sent and <br>
the amount of CPU time which must be spent processing them,
to transfer the same amount of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you are experimenting
with changes to the low level code, there is probably no
reason to ever use this option to override the latency
manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fold=n <br>
Set the number of times to fold the BitBabbler output before
analysing it. Each fold will take the first half of the
block that was read and XOR it with the bits in the <br>
second half. This will halve the throughput, but concentrate
the available entropy more densely into the bits that
remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two main things this
is expected to do based on the BitBabbler design. It will
better mix the low-frequency noise that is captured with
that of the higher fre&acirc; <br>
quencies, allowing it to sample at higher bitrates without
narrowing the noise bandwidth available to influence
adjacent bits. It will help to break up any transient <br>
local correlations that might occur in the physical
processes from which ambient environmental noise is
collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folding should never reduce the
real entropy of each sample, but when all is working exactly
as it should, it may not do anything to increase it either.
Mathematically, <br>
an XOR summation is expected to exponentially smooth any
bias in a stream of independent bits, with the result having
at least as much entropy as the least predictable of <br>
either of the two inputs (in the same way that a one time
pad is no less secure despite the plaintext having much less
entropy than the pad does).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable=mask <br>
Select a subset of the generators on BitBabbler devices with
multiple entropy sources. The argument is a bitmask packed
from the LSB, with each bit position controlling <br>
an individual source, enabling it when set to 1. As a
special case for bbcheck, if a mask of 0 is used, then the
tests will be performed on each source unit individually.
<br>
A mask of 16 (0x10) will first test each source
individually, and then all of of them enabled together as
well.</p>
