<p>LIFT.YAML(1) Lift Manual LIFT.YAML(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lift.yaml - Define a Lift test suite</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Lift provides an integration/functional test platform which
handle executable tests easily and generically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lift.yaml files are used to
define a test suite. Such a file is written in YAML
(http://yaml.org/) and support 3 root sections types:
settings, local tests and remote tests. <br>
These are documented further below in this
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Lift test suite is composed of
at least one lift.yaml file but it is often a folder
hierarchy with one lift.yaml file at each level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such a hierarchy is useful to
define more specialized sub-suites (eg. one for basic
functionalities, one for performances...). Each sub-suite
has its own lift.yaml and can be run <br>
individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings defined on a lift.yaml
file are inherited in sub-suites. Sub-suites can override
inherited settings if they need to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTINGS DEFINITION <br>
This section is used to define remotes machines that will be
used for remote tests and to define environment variables
that will be passed to tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variables can be
overridden for each test individually in their
definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;settings&rsquo;
section has to be defined at the root of the lift.yaml
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">settings: <br>
# The &rsquo;define&rsquo; keyword followed by the remote
name <br>
define my_remote: <br>
host: localhost # mandatory <br>
username: root # mandatory <br>
password: foobar # optional (if ssh keys are set properly)
<br>
define my_other_remote: <br>
host: localhost <br>
username: not_root <br>
password: foobar <br>
# These will be transmitted to the test commands <br>
# They can be used as a way to pass common settings around
<br>
environment: <br>
MY_ENV_VAR1: foo <br>
MY_ENV_VAR2: bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL TEST DEFINITION <br>
Each test is represented by a single section at the root of
the lift.yaml file. Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># the &rsquo;test&rsquo; keyword
followed by the test name <br>
test my_test_name: <br>
command: &quot;./my_test_executable --my-arg&quot; #
mandatory <br>
return code: 0 # optional (default to 0) <br>
timeout: 10 # optional, in seconds (no timeout by default)
<br>
environment: # optional <br>
MY_VAR: 42 # may override an already defined variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a test timeouts, it will
return 124. You can therefore test that a command does
timeout by setting the &rsquo;return code&rsquo; value to
124.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual environment used by a
test is computed in the following order: environment defined
in higher level lift.yaml files (inheritance), then the
environment defined in the <br>
current lift.yaml file and finally the environment defined
in the test itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;command&rsquo; can be
an absolute path, a path relative to the current lift.yaml
position or a system command (like ping, curl...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE TEST DEFINITION <br>
Each remote test is represented by a single section at the
root of the lift.yaml file. Please also refer to the local
test definition documentation, as all options are reused in
<br>
the same way for remote tests. Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># A known remote name followed
by the &rsquo;test&rsquo; keyword and the test name <br>
# This defines a test that will be ran on my_remote. <br>
my_remote test my_remote_test_name: <br>
command: &quot;sh test/test.sh --my-arg&quot; <br>
return code: 0 <br>
timeout: 2 <br>
# List files and folders that will be uploaded to the remote
<br>
# before running the test. <br>
resources: <br>
- test/ <br>
environment: <br>
MY_VAR: content</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be known, a remote has to be
defined either in a higher level lift.yaml file
(inheritance) or in the current lift.yaml or directly via
the --remote option of the lift command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files resources are uploaded
&quot;flatly&quot; whereas folders keep their structure.
Lift will take care of deleting all resources from the
remote after the test is over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command will be executed in
a temporary directory that will be created on the remote.
Resources will be put in this directory, so you can use
relative paths to them in your <br>
command/executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FULL TEST SUITE EXAMPLE <br>
The example folder at the root of the Lift sources contains
a fully commented example of a Lift test suite, which can
also be used as a functional test suite for Lift itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Debian systems, the example
folder can be found in /usr/share/doc/lift/example.</p>
