<p>COMMIT-PATCH(1) User Commands COMMIT-PATCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
commit-patch - commit patches to Darcs, Git, Mercurial,
Bazaar, Monotone, Subversion, or CVS repositories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
commit-patch [--amend] [-m message] [-F message-file] [-v]
[--dry-run] [patch-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit-partial [--amend] [-v]
[--dry-run] [--retry] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Normally version control systems don&rsquo;t allow fine
grained commits. commit-patch allows the user to control
exactly what gets committed (or &quot;recorded&quot;, in
Darcs parlance) by <br>
letting the user supply a patch to be committed rather than
using the files in the current working directory. If
patch-file is not supplied on the command line then the
patch <br>
will be read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit-partial is like
commit-patch except that it will create a patch from the
current changes in the current working directory and launch
your editor so that you can edit the <br>
patch and the commit message (using the VISUAL environment
variable, or if that isn&rsquo;t set the EDITOR environment
variable, or, if that isn&rsquo;t set, vi. Any files you
specify will <br>
be passed to your version control&rsquo;s diff command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit-patch currently supports
the following version control systems: Darcs, Git,
Mercurial, Bazaar, Monotone, Subversion, and CVS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --amend - Amend a previous commit. Currently only Darcs
and Git support this option. When used with Git it will
amend the previous commit. When used with Darcs, Darcs will
<br>
ask you which patch you want to amend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --message=message - An
optional message to use as the commit text. If the message
is multiple lines then Darcs, Git, and Mercurial will use
the first line as the patch name <br>
and the rest as commit details. If the &quot;-m&quot; option
is not specified then the result will be the same as
whatever the underlying version control system would do if
you didn&rsquo;t <br>
specify a message name on the command line. That is,
commit-patch does not interfere with the patch naming
process of the underlying version control system; Darcs will
still ask <br>
you interactively; CVS and Subversion will still launch your
editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --message-file=filename -
You can optionally get the commit message from a file. This
is generally only useful for scripting commit-patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose - Turn on
debugging. This will print the commands that commit-patch is
running to get the patch committed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run - Turn on more
paranoid debugging. This will print the commands that
commit-patch will run to get the patch committed but it
won&rsquo;t actually run those commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --retry - Only available in
commit-partial. This will reload the last patch that was
attempted to be committed into your editor instead of the
current changes in the <br>
directory. This is for cases where the patch fails to commit
for some reason and you want to try to fix it instead of
starting over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
commit-patch works by manipulating the working directory
using &quot;patch&quot;, &quot;interdiff&quot;, and the
underlying version control system&rsquo;s &quot;diff&quot;.
If any part of the process fails, <br>
commit-patch will attempt to restore the working directory
to the state it was before the command was run. Any errors
from the underlying version control system or from patch
<br>
will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The patch specified on the command line must originate from
the same place as the current directory. That is, the
following will not work:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs diff -u &gt; ../a.patch <br>
cd .. <br>
commit-patch a.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must run commit-patch from
the same directory that the original patch was based
from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs, Git and Mercurial put
&quot;a/&quot; and &quot;b/&quot; in front of all the paths
in the diff output. Don&rsquo;t worry about this;
commit-patch takes it into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Typical CVS usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs diff -u &gt; a.patch <br>
emacs a.patch <br>
commit-patch a.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mercurial usage with a message
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hg diff &gt; a.patch <br>
emacs a.patch <br>
commit-patch -m &quot;This is a commit message&quot;
a.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs usage with a multi-line
message specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs diff -u &gt; a.patch <br>
emacs a.patch <br>
commit-patch -m &rsquo;This is the patch name <br>
Here are the patch details&rsquo; a.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
commit-patch was originally called
&quot;cvs-commit-patch&quot; and was a bash script written
in 2003 by Jim Radford (with David Caldwell in the room
drawing the procedure on a white <br>
board). David later converted it do
&quot;darcs-commit-patch&quot;, then integrated them back
together into commit-patch. Mercurial support was then
added. At some point David translated <br>
from bash into perl because funky bash quoting issues were
causing problems with a repository that had a space in one
of the directory names.</p>
