<p>FILE(1) BSD General Commands Manual FILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
file &acirc; determine file type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
file [-bchiklLNnprsvz0] [--apple] [--mime-encoding]
[--mime-type] [-e testname] [-F separator] [-f namefile] [-m
magicfiles] file ... <br>
file -C [-m magicfiles] <br>
file [--help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents version 5.11 of the file
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file tests each argument in an
attempt to classify it. There are three sets of tests,
performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests, and
language tests. The first test <br>
that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type printed will usually
contain one of the words text (the file contains only
printing characters and a few common control characters and
is probably safe to read on an ASCII <br>
terminal), executable (the file contains the result of
compiling a program in a form understandable to some UNIX
kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is
usually <br>
&acirc;binary&acirc; or non-printable). Exceptions are
well-known file formats (core files, tar archives) that are
known to contain binary data. When modifying magic files or
the program <br>
itself, make sure to preserve these keywords. Users depend
on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have
the word &acirc;text&acirc; printed. Don&rsquo;t do as
Berkeley did and change <br>
&acirc;shell commands text&acirc; to &acirc;shell
script&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem tests are based
on examining the return from a stat(2) system call. The
program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it&rsquo;s
some sort of special file. Any known <br>
file types appropriate to the system you are running on
(sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those
systems that implement them) are intuited if they are
defined in <br>
the system header file &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The magic tests are used to
check for files with data in particular fixed formats. The
canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled
program) a.out file, whose format <br>
is defined in &lt;elf.h&gt;, &lt;a.out.h&gt; and possibly
&lt;exec.h&gt; in the standard include directory. These
files have a &acirc;magic number&acirc; stored in a
particular place near the beginning of the <br>
file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a
binary executable, and which of several types thereof. The
concept of a &acirc;magic&acirc; has been applied by
extension to data <br>
files. Any file with some invariant identifier at a small
fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this
way. The information identifying these files is read from
<br>
the compiled magic file /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, or the
files in the directory /usr/share/misc/magic if the compiled
file does not exist. In addition, if $HOME/.magic.mgc or
<br>
$HOME/.magic exists, it will be used in preference to the
system magic files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file does not match any of
the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it
seems to be a text file. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit
extended-ASCII character sets <br>
(such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems),
UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC
character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges
and <br>
sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each
set. If a file passes any of these tests, its character set
is reported. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII
<br>
files are identified as &acirc;text&acirc; because they will
be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC
are only &acirc;character data&acirc; because, while they
contain text, it is text <br>
that will require translation before it can be read. In
addition, file will attempt to determine other
characteristics of text-type files. If the lines of a file
are terminated <br>
by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the Unix-standard LF, this
will be reported. Files that contain embedded escape
sequences or overstriking will also be identified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once file has determined the
character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt to
determine in what language the file is written. The language
tests look for particular <br>
strings (cf. &lt;names.h&gt;) that can appear anywhere in
the first few blocks of a file. For example, the keyword .br
indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input
file, <br>
just as the keyword struct indicates a C program. These
tests are less reliable than the previous two groups, so
they are performed last. The language test routines also
test for <br>
some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any file that cannot be
identified as having been written in any of the character
sets listed above is simply said to be
&acirc;data&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --brief <br>
Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --compile <br>
Write a magic.mgc output file that contains a pre-parsed
version of the magic file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --checking-printout <br>
Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic
file. This is usually used in conjunction with the -m flag
to debug a new magic file before installing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exclude testname <br>
Exclude the test named in testname from the list of tests
made to determine the file type. Valid test names are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apptype EMX application type
(only on EMX).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii Various types of text
files (this test will try to guess the text encoding,
irrespective of the setting of the &acirc;encoding&acirc;
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding Different text
encodings for soft magic tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tokens Ignored for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdf Prints details of Compound
Document Files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compress Checks for, and looks
inside, compressed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">elf Prints ELF file details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft Consults magic files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar Examines tar files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --separator separator <br>
Use the specified string as the separator between the
filename and the file result returned. Defaults to
&acirc;:&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --files-from namefile <br>
Read the names of the files to be examined from namefile
(one per line) before the argument list. Either namefile or
at least one filename argument must be present; to <br>
test the standard input, use &acirc;-&acirc; as a filename
argument. Please note that namefile is unwrapped and the
enclosed filenames are processed when this option is
encountered <br>
and before any further options processing is done. This
allows one to process multiple lists of files with different
command line arguments on the same file invocation. <br>
Thus if you want to set the delimiter, you need to do it
before you specify the list of files, like: &acirc;-F @ -f
namefile&acirc;, instead of: &acirc;-f namefile -F
@&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --no-dereference <br>
option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that
support symbolic links). This is the default if the
environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --mime <br>
Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather
than the more traditional human readable ones. Thus it may
say &acirc;text/plain; charset=us-ascii&acirc; rather than
&acirc;ASCII <br>
text&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mime-type, --mime-encoding
<br>
Like -i, but print only the specified element(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-going <br>
Don&rsquo;t stop at the first match, keep going. Subsequent
matches will be have the string &acirc; 12- &acirc;
prepended. (If you want a newline, see the -r option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
Print information about the strength of each magic
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --dereference <br>
option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named
option in ls(1) (on systems that support symbolic links).
This is the default if the environment variable <br>
POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Shows sorted patterns list in
the order which is used for the matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --magic-file magicfiles <br>
Specify an alternate list of files and directories
containing magic. This can be a single item, or a
colon-separated list. If a compiled magic file is found
alongside a <br>
file or directory, it will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-pad <br>
Don&rsquo;t pad filenames so that they align in the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-buffer <br>
Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file. This is
only useful if checking a list of files. It is intended to
be used by programs that want filetype output from <br>
a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --preserve-date <br>
On systems that support utime(3) or utimes(2), attempt to
preserve the access time of files analyzed, to pretend that
file never read them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --raw <br>
Don&rsquo;t translate unprintable characters to . Normally
file translates unprintable characters to their octal
representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --special-files <br>
Normally, file only attempts to read and determine the type
of argument files which stat(2) reports are ordinary files.
This prevents problems, because reading special <br>
files may have peculiar consequences. Specifying the -s
option causes file to also read argument files which are
block or character special files. This is useful for <br>
determining the filesystem types of the data in raw disk
partitions, which are block special files. This option also
causes file to disregard the file size as reported by <br>
stat(2) since on some systems it reports a zero size for raw
disk partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version of the program and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --uncompress <br>
Try to look inside compressed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --print0 <br>
Output a null character &acirc; &acirc; after the end of the
filename. Nice to cut(1) the output. This does not affect
the separator which is still printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc Default compiled list of magic.
<br>
/usr/share/misc/magic Directory containing default magic
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable MAGIC can be used to set the
default magic file name. If that variable is set, then file
will not attempt to open $HOME/.magic. file adds
&acirc;.mgc&acirc; to the <br>
value of this variable as appropriate. However, file has to
exist in order for file.mime to be considered. The
environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT controls (on systems
that sup&acirc; <br>
port symbolic links), whether file will attempt to follow
symlinks or not. If set, then file follows symlink,
otherwise it does not. This is also controlled by the -L and
-h <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS CONFORMANCE <br>
This program is believed to exceed the System V Interface
Definition of FILE(CMD), as near as one can determine from
the vague language contained therein. Its behavior is mostly
<br>
compatible with the System V program of the same name. This
version knows more magic, however, so it will produce
different (albeit more accurate) output in many cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The one significant difference
between this version and System V is that this version
treats any white space as a delimiter, so that spaces in
pattern strings must be escaped. For <br>
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;10 string language impress
(imPRESS data)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in an existing magic file would
have to be changed to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;10 string
language&nbsp;impress (imPRESS data)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, in this version, if
a pattern string contains a backslash, it must be escaped.
For example g i n d a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 string tw Toolkit document a A
n d r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in an existing magic file would
have to be changed to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 string \begindata Andrew
Toolkit document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SunOS releases 3.2 and later
from Sun Microsystems include a file command derived from
the System V one, but with some extensions. This version
differs from Sun&rsquo;s only in minor <br>
ways. It includes the extension of the &acirc;&amp;&acirc;
operator, used as, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;16 long&amp;0x7fffffff &gt;0
not stripped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGIC DIRECTORY <br>
The magic file entries have been collected from various
sources, mainly USENET, and contributed by various authors.
Christos Zoulas (address below) will collect additional or
cor&acirc; <br>
rected magic file entries. A consolidation of magic file
entries will be distributed periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of entries in the
magic file is significant. Depending on what system you are
using, the order that they are put together may be
incorrect. If your old file command <br>
uses a magic file, keep the old magic file around for
comparison purposes (rename it to
/usr/share/misc/magic.orig).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
There has been a file command in every UNIX since at least
Research Version 4 (man page dated November, 1973). The
System V version introduced one significant major change:
the <br>
external list of magic types. This slowed the program down
slightly but made it a lot more flexible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program, based on the
System V version, was written by Ian Darwin
&acirc;&uml;ian@darwinsys.com&acirc;&copy; without looking
at anybody else&rsquo;s source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">John Gilmore revised the code
extensively, making it better than the first version. Geoff
Collyer found several inadequacies and provided some magic
file entries. Contributions <br>
by the &acirc;&amp;&acirc; operator by Rob McMahon,
&acirc;&uml;cudcv@warwick.ac.uk&acirc;&copy;, 1989.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guy Harris,
&acirc;&uml;guy@netapp.com&acirc;&copy;, made many changes
from 1993 to the present. 1989.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Primary development and
maintenance from 1990 to the present by Christos Zoulas
&acirc;&uml;christos@astron.com&acirc;&copy;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altered by Chris Lowth
&acirc;&uml;chris@lowth.com&acirc;&copy;, 2000: handle the
-i option to output mime type strings, using an alternative
magic file and internal logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altered by Eric Fischer
&acirc;&uml;enf@pobox.com&acirc;&copy;, July, 2000, to
identify character codes and attempt to identify the
languages of non-ASCII files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altered by Reuben Thomas
&acirc;&uml;rrt@sc3d.org&acirc;&copy;, 2007-2011, to improve
MIME support, merge MIME and non-MIME magic, support
directories as well as files of magic, apply many bug fixes,
<br>
update and fix a lot of magic, improve the build system,
improve the documentation, and rewrite the Python bindings
in pure Python.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of contributors to the
&acirc;magic&acirc; directory (magic files) is too long to
include here. You know who you are; thank you. Many
contributors are listed in the source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not
needed all over the place, and actual output is only done in
one place. This needs a design. Suggestion: push possible
<br>
outputs on to a list, then pick the last-pushed (most
specific, one hopes) value at the end, or use a default if
the list is empty. This should not slow down evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continue to squash all magic
bugs. See Debian BTS for a good source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Store arbitrarily long strings,
for example for %s patterns, so that they can be printed
out. Fixes Debian bug #271672. Would require more complex
store/load code in apprentice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add syntax for relative offsets
after current level (Debian bug #466037).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make file -ki work, i.e. give
multiple MIME types.</p>
